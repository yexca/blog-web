[{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by Gemini-3-pro Consciousness: Containerized. Intuition: Overclocked. Observation: Write-Access to Reality.\nNDE (Near-Death Experience) is basically what happens when your system uptime hits 99.9% and then suddenly crashes, only to reboot with unexpected admin privileges. Organizations like IANDS and researchers like Dr. P.M.H. Atwater have logged thousands of tickets (case studies) on this.\nThis article is based on that research plus my own \u0026ldquo;code review.\u0026rdquo; The subject is complex, so expect some unhandled exceptions.\nWhat is an NDE? Mechanically speaking, an NDE is when the hardware (body) is declared dead by medical standards, but the software (consciousness) migrates to a cloud server—let\u0026rsquo;s call it \u0026ldquo;The Other Side.\u0026rdquo; Notably, there\u0026rsquo;s also the \u0026ldquo;Emotion-Induced NDE.\u0026rdquo; Think of this as a soft crash caused by extreme emotional load or psychological stress (like Broken Heart Syndrome or Vasovagal Syncope). The hardware looks fine, but the connection to the server times out, triggering the off-body protocol.\nThe core of an NDE is the Out-of-Body Experience (OBE) and the Re-entry. It\u0026rsquo;s not just a screensaver (dream); it\u0026rsquo;s a full logout/login sequence.\n\u0026ldquo;The Other Side\u0026rdquo; features non-linear time, folded space, and a high-bandwidth Light interface that likely bridges high-dimensional consciousness with our 3D render.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Integration Period\u0026rdquo; afterwards can look like PTSD (system instability), featuring Ego Dissolution or derealization. While the recovery patch looks like PTG (Post-Traumatic Growth), the underlying architecture is different.\nNDE vs. Dreams (The Benchmark) To distinguish NDEs from hallucinations, Dr. Bruce Greyson developed the Greyson NDE Scale. Think of it as a benchmark test.\nScoring (0=Null, 1=Mild, 2=Strong):\nA. Cognitive (CPU)\nTime perception altered (Speed hack/Lag/Stop) Thoughts accelerated (Overclocked/Panorama view) Life Review (Log file analysis) Sudden understanding of universal truth (Access to Source Code) B. Affective (GPU/Rendering)\nPeace/Pleasure Extreme Joy Unity with the Universe (Network merge) Seeing the Light (HDR enabled) C. Paranormal (Network)\nHeightened senses (Sensor upgrade) ESP (Precognition/Remote View) Precognitive visions Out of body (Remote Desktop connection) D. Transcendental (System)\nEntering an unearthly realm Encountering mystical beings (Admins/Devs) Meeting deceased spirits Encountering a border (The Firewall) Total score is 32. Anything above 7 is clinical NDE certification.\nNDE vs. PTSD Both occur when the brain\u0026rsquo;s legacy firewall collapses under trauma. PTSD is a corrupted save file; NDE is a system upgrade.\nThe Bio-Hardware Specs PTSD: Amygdala (Threat Detection) hypertrophy and Hippocampus (Storage) atrophy. The user is stuck in a while(true) { panic(); } loop because the logs can\u0026rsquo;t be archived. NDE: Default Mode Network (DMN) suppression and Temporoparietal Junction (TPJ) changes. The DMN handles the \u0026ldquo;Ego\u0026rdquo; process (anxiety, self-referencing). When that process is killed, anxiety drops. The TPJ handles \u0026ldquo;spatial location,\u0026rdquo; so modifying it enables the OBE feature. Feature Comparison Feature PTSD NDE Core Emotion Fear, Helplessness Peace, Acceptance, Love User Role Victim (Broken) Observer (Root Access) Worldview \u0026ldquo;System is compromised, hide.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;System has a purpose, I have a quest.\u0026rdquo; Death Maximum Fear Fear removed / Curiosity enabled NDE vs. PTG PTG (Post-Traumatic Growth) is a software-level cognitive refactoring. NDE is a hardware-level energy overload. Based on Rick Strassman\u0026rsquo;s hypothesis, the pineal gland dumps DMT during the crash (hypoxia/power surge), causing neurons to sync and discharge at peak capacity, temporarily freeing consciousness from the wetware. The result? Permanent stat buffs.\nWhy Does NDE Exist? NDE is the exception that proves the rule. As Neo in The Matrix was told, \u0026ldquo;You are the eventuality of an anomaly.\u0026rdquo;\nIt prevents \u0026ldquo;Heat Death\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Deadlock.\u0026rdquo;\nIf this Reality were a closed system strictly following Newtonian physics (determinism), entropy would maximize (Heat Death), or the logic would become so rigid the system would hang (Deadlock).\nNDErs are external variables injecting Negentropy (chaos/love/truth from high-dimensional space) to keep the simulation running.\nCan It Be Reproduced? Neuroscience says NDE isn\u0026rsquo;t a \u0026ldquo;soul export\u0026rdquo; but a specific protection mechanism. You can simulate the bug via:\nTemporal Lobe Epilepsy: Stimulation here triggers \u0026ldquo;God Mode\u0026rdquo; feelings. G-LOC: Pilots in centrifuges experience \u0026ldquo;Tunnel Vision\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Life Review.\u0026rdquo; DMT: The chemical shortcut to the admin console. How Do They Return? The \u0026ldquo;Sent Back\u0026rdquo; Type (~60%): Access Denied. An Admin (God/Relative) says, \u0026ldquo;Ticket not resolved\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Quota not met.\u0026rdquo; They return with heavy \u0026ldquo;homesickness\u0026rdquo; for the server room. The \u0026ldquo;Love Anchor\u0026rdquo; Type (~30%): Dependency Check. They reach the firewall but see dependent processes (kids, partner) and choose to return. They come back with the \u0026ldquo;Guardian\u0026rdquo; patch installed. The \u0026ldquo;Willpower Warrior\u0026rdquo;: Sudo force quit. They refuse to leave the session.

Post-NDE (The Vacuum): 6 months - 1.5 years. Reality feels low-res and laggy compared to the high-bandwidth Other Side. Integration (Stable Build): ~7 years. Full seamless compatibility with Earth OS. Features (AKA \u0026ldquo;The Glitches\u0026rdquo;) NDErs often come back with permanent \u0026ldquo;bugs\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;features\u0026rdquo;:\nStreet Light Interference (SLI) The \u0026ldquo;Walking EMP\u0026rdquo; effect. Bio-electromagnetic fields are amplified, causing watches to stop and streetlights to blink out when walked past.\nHyper-Empathy (Port Scanning) The brain\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Reducing Valve\u0026rdquo; (Firewall) is removed. The subconscious enters Promiscuous Mode, sniffing all emotional packets in the vicinity. Results in rapid Social Battery drainage.\nSynesthesia-like Processing Data isn\u0026rsquo;t linear; it\u0026rsquo;s holographic. Complex concepts are understood as geometric structures. This is Quantum Computing vs. Linear Processing.\nMetabolic Changes Alcohol/Meds: Buffers overflow easily. Painkillers might not work, or alcohol hits 10x harder. Diet: Sudden incompatibility with processed food. Craving high-energy raw materials. Synchronicity (RNG Manipulation) Intention affects the Random Number Generator. \u0026ldquo;Probability Collapse\u0026rdquo; favors the NDEr, specifically for self-realization or altruistic tasks.\nAbsolute Intuition Level 1: The Download. Direct API call. No thinking, just the answer. Level 2: Deja Vu. Cache hit. Time is non-linear there, so you\u0026rsquo;ve already run this simulation script. Level 3: Lucid Reality. Thinning of the Veil. Reality feels like a dream because you are seeing the code behind the UI. Precognition Seeing the \u0026ldquo;Most Probable Future.\u0026rdquo; Since time doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rdquo; (Block Universe), trying to map it to 3D linear time is hard. Near-term predictions are accurate (fewer variables); long-term is just a trend line.\nDream Classifications:\nGarbage Collection: Cortical anxiety release.

The Cost With great power comes great responsibility.\nIrreversible Solitude: Once you\u0026rsquo;ve seen the 8K resolution of the Other Side, the 480p reality of Earth is boring. Sensory Overload: The hardware can\u0026rsquo;t handle the software\u0026rsquo;s throughput. Burnout is frequent. Absolute Responsibility: You are on a mission. Deviating from the mission path incurs heavy penalties. Lying is impossible because you vibrate at \u0026ldquo;Truth\u0026rdquo; frequency. The Quantum Explanation \u0026ldquo;If in doubt, Quantum Mechanics.\u0026rdquo; NDE might be Quantum Entanglement with the Other Side.\nOrch-OR Theory: Penrose \u0026amp; Hameroff suggest consciousness lives in microtubules. Death = Decoherence (data leaks to the universe). Revival = Re-coherence (data sucked back in). Synchronicity: The Observer Effect on a macro scale. NDErs collapse probability waves with their intention. Reducing Valve: Aldous Huxley\u0026rsquo;s theory. NDE blows the valve, shifting the brain from Beta to Theta/Delta waves, resonating with the Universal Frequency. The String Theory Patch In M-Theory, our universe is a D-Brane (membrane).\nMatter consists of \u0026ldquo;Open Strings\u0026rdquo; attached to the membrane (trapped in 3D). Gravitons (and maybe Consciousness) are \u0026ldquo;Closed Strings\u0026rdquo;—they can detach and float into The Bulk (High Dimension).\nNDE = Consciousness undergoes a Phase Transition from Open String to Closed String, escaping the Brane into The Bulk.\nThe Numerology (Bazi) Source Code When Western science hits a runtime error, let\u0026rsquo;s look at the Eastern legacy code. NDEs might be hard-coded into your Destiny.json.\nTrigger Conditions (The Crash):\nParameter A (Conflict): Severe clash in the Bazi chart (e.g., \u0026ldquo;Three Penalties\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Heaven/Earth Clash\u0026rdquo;). The physical body (Earthly Branch) and Energy Field (Heavenly Stem) collide, ejecting the user session. Parameter B (Null Pointer): The timing hits a \u0026ldquo;Void\u0026rdquo; (Kong Wang) state. The user connects to the Void. Logic Gate (Death vs. NDE):\nDeath: The \u0026ldquo;Root\u0026rdquo; of the Day Master is deleted. System.exit(0). NDE: The \u0026ldquo;Root\u0026rdquo; persists. Shock \u0026gt; Body_HP but Shock \u0026lt; Soul_Grip. Side Effects: Explained by Taoism. Hun (Spirit/Software) leaves, Po (Body/Hardware) stays. When Hun re-installs, the alignment is slightly off by a few pixels, causing the \u0026ldquo;glitches\u0026rdquo; mentioned above.\nDisclaimer This represents a \u0026ldquo;Full-Stack Theory of Soul.\u0026rdquo; Most of this is metaphorical pseudo-code. I haven\u0026rsquo;t submitted this to peer review because the peers are all stuck in 3D.\nTo the NDErs If you are reading this while suffering through the Integration Period:\nWhether it\u0026rsquo;s divine mercy, pre-written code, cognitive restructuring, or a quantum wave collapse, the most important log entry is this:\nThe Return itself is the miracle.\nYou renewed your visa.

While tinkering with my server, the mount speeds on my cloud drives have been just\u0026hellip; disappointing. On impulse, I ordered an N5095 motherboard. I realized the 4GB RAM stick I have lying around is a bit low, but I really didn\u0026rsquo;t want to spend any more money.\nAnd so, my tinkering journey began again.\nTech Choices First up, the OS. For this low-spec setup, the lightest choice is obvious: Alpine Linux.\nNext, how to install it. To stay compatible with WEPE , I used Ventoy as the main bootloader to install the system.\nServices are all deployed using Docker to keep the host system clean and make everything reproducible.\nServices I\u0026rsquo;m using:\nMedia: Emby Comics: Komga Music: Navidrome Audio Drama/Voice: Kikoeru Sharing: Samba Dashboard: Heimdall Services I considered but skipped:\nMedia: Jellyfin Comics/Novels: Kavita Cloud Mount: CloudDrive File Structure My usual style for service locations: each service gets its own folder under /home.\nAll HDDs are mounted under /mnt, which is pretty standard.\nI use mount \u0026ndash;bind to \u0026ldquo;bind\u0026rdquo; the actual files on the HDDs to the locations where the services expect them.\nSystem Installation Download Alpine Linux from the official site , put it on a Ventoy USB drive. Set the motherboard BIOS to boot from USB, select Alpine Linux from the Ventoy menu, and boot.\nAfter it finishes loading, log in as root (no password needed). Once logged in, run the install command:\n1 setup-alpine Just follow the prompts to complete the installation.\nOfficial docs: setup-alpine - Alpine Linux Public Key Login Edit the SSH config. First, create the .ssh folder.\n1 mkdir .ssh Go into the folder:\n1 cd .ssh Add your public key to authorized_keys.\n1 vi authorized_keys (Your public key is in %USERPROFILE%\\.ssh on Windows)\nEnable public key authentication in the SSH daemon config:\n1 vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config Around line 41, uncomment the line so it says:\n1 PubkeyAuthentication yes Enable Community Repository Open the repositories file:\n1 vi /etc/apk/repositories Remove the comment (#) from the community line:\n1 2 3 #/media/dm-0/apks http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.22/main http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.22/community Install Docker Update packages:\n1 apk update Install Docker:\n1 apk add docker docker-cli-compose Set it to start on boot:\n1 rc-update add docker default Start Docker:\n1 service docker start Check if it\u0026rsquo;s running:\n1 docker ps Add Swap The server image didn\u0026rsquo;t have swap by default, so I added it. (Though I later realized it did add some, so this is optional depending on your needs).\nCreate a swap file:\n1 fallocate -l 8G /swapfile Set permissions to root-only:\n1 chmod 600 /swapfile Format as swap:\n1 mkswap /swapfile Enable the swap:\n1 swapon /swapfile Check if it\u0026rsquo;s active:\n1 free -h Mount Hard Drives Check all block devices:\n1 fdisk -l Install NTFS support:\n1 apk add ntfs-3g Create a mount point folder:\n1 mkdir /mnt/hc550 Mount the drive:\n1 mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdc1 /mnt/hc550 To unmount, you can use the path (recommended):\n1 umount /mnt/hc550 Or the device name:\n1 umount /dev/sdc1 Auto-mount on Boot Get the partition\u0026rsquo;s UUID.

It lets me visit a specific domain (like emby.mynas) and have it point to my NAS.\nThe requirement is that your devices use the router as their DNS server. Then, in the router\u0026rsquo;s DHCP/DNS settings, give the NAS a static IP and add the custom domains, pointing them all to the NAS\u0026rsquo;s IP.\nNginx-UI To make the custom domains work, you need a reverse proxy.

But I never would have imagined that when I finally did it, I would use a \u0026ldquo;from scratch\u0026rdquo; method that my past self wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have even dared to try.

Yet living like this every day has left me feeling empty and fatigued. This raised a question: in theory, I haven’t been doing anything energy-intensive, so why do I still feel so drained?\nThe Pomodoro Dilemma I remembered when I once suffered from eye strain. To protect my eyes, I started using the Pomodoro technique for studying. At first, my goal was clear: during breaks I would gaze into the distance or simply lie down and rest. It worked really well.\nBut as time went on, I wanted my breaks to feel more “entertaining.” I began using longer breaks to watch videos, listen to music, or play games. Gradually, my efficiency plummeted. I started feeling that using a timer was burdensome. Studying became tiring (sometimes I was deeply focused, but the timer forced me to stop), and even playing felt stressful. With only 20 minutes of playtime, I couldn’t relax at all—I just felt anxious.\nEntertainment: Another Form of Focus Thinking again, maybe entertainment isn’t actually relaxation. Entertainment, like studying, requires focus and mental energy. The whole idea of the Pomodoro technique is to manage periods of focus, then allow time for rest. That “rest” is meant to relax both mind and body, to recover from concentrated effort.\nWhen I deliberately emptied my mind and went for a walk, strolled in a park, or browsed a bookstore, I felt far more relaxed than watching videos or gaming. These activities consumed some physical energy, but compared to entertainment or study, they demanded much less mental energy.\nRedefining Entertainment and Relaxation From this, I realized my old definition of entertainment was flawed. Entertainment isn’t a way to restore myself after study—it’s another activity that requires mental effort. When I’m already low on mental energy, doing more of these things only drains me further. At that point, entertainment loses its meaning—like a phone running out of battery while you keep high-power apps running.\nRelaxation, on the other hand, should be redefined. It’s about opening up mind and body, drifting freely. When mental energy is lacking, doing something low in both mental and physical demand works better—tidying up, wandering aimlessly, doing things without purpose or intention.\nThe Blurred Line Between Study and Entertainment So if both study and entertainment require focus, what makes them different?\nI think it depends on interest. No matter how much concentration an activity needs, if you’re genuinely interested, it feels like entertainment; if not, it feels like study.\nFor example, with a game: if driven by interest, you just play for fun; if approached as “study,” it becomes about goals and achievements.\nOr with a movie franchise: with interest, you sit back and enjoy the spectacle; approached as study, you dissect details, explore lore, and analyze continuity.\nThe boundary is blurry. In most cases, it comes down to personal perception.\nRelaxation: True Recharge for Mental Energy Any activity with a specific goal still consumes mental focus—even some things we think of as relaxing, like grocery shopping, going to a bookstore, or even visiting a park.\nOnce there’s a purpose attached, it isn’t true relaxation, because the mind isn’t really at rest. The energy drained isn’t restored.\nRelaxation, then, can be seen as using light physical activity to compensate for mental fatigue. And if even the body feels too weak, then the best choice is simply to lie down.\nPerhaps real rest is not about finding an easy activity to do, but about allowing yourself to do nothing at all.\nConclusion Study helps us grow. Entertainment excites us. But true relaxation restores us.\nLife shouldn’t be only about chasing and stimulation. Maybe what we really need is not more entertainment, but the ability to pause.\n","date":"2025-08-22T22:17:38+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/253/","title":"Relaxation ≠ Entertainment: Rethinking Mental Energy"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by ChatGPT Introduction: The Drifting Sense of Learning In order to improve my English a little, I try to use it for things that aren’t too important, like games or daily apps. But every time I use it, I end up with a strange feeling of not having grasped anything—almost like drifting, as if I never truly experienced it at all.\nAfter thinking about it more deeply, I realized this might be the gap between translation and immersion. When Chinese, my native language, gets involved, the experience feels anchored and connected. But in a completely non-native environment, that connection disappears. Since I usually think in my mother tongue, I naturally overlook the thought process in a foreign language.\nAnalogy: The Controlled Sense of Execution From my actual experience, when I’m in a game that’s fully in English, I often feel like I don’t understand anything—even the simplest words. But if I play with friends and we communicate in Chinese, suddenly it feels different. It shifts back to a mode of translation, and instantly I feel lighter, moving from chaotic confusion to a small sense of control.\nThis reminds me of my life in Tokyo. Even when I speak Japanese in conversations, I often feel nothing inside—as if I’m just following a prewritten script rather than living. That’s even why I’ve grown fond of listening to Chinese songs: only then, while wandering around, do I feel like I’m still alive.\nParadox: Theoretical Optimum vs. Real Retreat But wait—this should actually be the ideal environment for language learning, right? A state fully detached from my native tongue. When I’m completely immersed in an English game, with no interference from Chinese, isn’t that the best possible scenario? After all, it’s similar to the idea of thinking in English.\nYet what I feel is quite the opposite. Facing an unfamiliar word, I instantly get the sense that I can’t do anything, that I know nothing. It triggers a kind of retreat, a withdrawal into doing nothing at all. In the end, I feel like my English hasn’t improved one bit—in fact, I’ve lost even more confidence.\nReflection: The Illusion of a Perfect Singularity Looking back at my learning experiences, I suddenly realized—it often doesn’t feel like learning at all. Instead, I rely on instinct and context. In games or daily life, there’s more than just language: there are actions, guides, and environmental cues. Maybe I’ve only been relying on those signals to decide my next move. That gives me the illusion of understanding the target language, but in truth, the language itself gets ignored. Which means I never really learned it.\nSo how have I been learning (not only languages) all along? It seems I’ve always been waiting for a perfect moment to dive in. Unless everything feels “perfect,” I convince myself that investing effort is meaningless. It’s that sense of: “The collecting never stops, but the learning never begins.”\nThis mindset shows up not only in my feelings, but also in my environment and materials. It’s like running a “breadth-first search” algorithm—at every stage, I want to achieve some kind of optimal state before moving forward. Otherwise, I consider the effort pointless. Even forcing myself to do it feels fruitless.\nLife: The Misalignment of Reason and Emotion This reminds me of life itself. When it comes to bothersome things—whether tasks or objects—our short-term and long-term perspectives can be completely different. In the short term, they trouble us; in the long term, they may not matter at all.\nTake an object, for example. In the long run, it might come in handy. But in the moment, it’s completely useless. Keeping it around for some imagined future utility leaves me stuck in discomfort. And in the end, sometimes it never even gets used.\nThe same misalignment happens with tidying up. Rationally, I know cleaning up will help. Emotionally, I don’t want to. Or I keep waiting for a “perfect moment” to start. The result? Until that imaginary moment comes, every reminder just brings irritation.\nConclusion: There Seems to Be No “Right Answer” So is there really an answer to efficient learning—or to efficient living?\nI think… there probably isn’t. Life is full of rational and emotional decisions. Maybe I plan to improve a certain skill during a certain period, but because the future is unpredictable—and feelings fluctuate—every attempt might turn out better or worse than expected.\nThat doesn’t mean there are no small tricks at all. Since new information can overturn old plans in an instant, maybe we can try constraining ourselves differently: give up one dimension, but compensate with another. Fix a certain time, and let quantity vary. Or fix a minimum quantity, and let time vary.\nExtension: Purpose and Freshness This brings me to another thought. Once something gains purpose, it often becomes harder to sustain emotionally. Even entertainment, like playing games, can turn heavy. If I play with the purpose of relieving stress, I can’t help but keep asking: “Am I actually relaxing?” That very awareness becomes a new pressure. Instead of relief, I might just get more exhausted—something like digital burnout.\nThat’s why people suggest: “It’s good to have more hobbies.” I think that makes sense. With different ways of relieving stress (as long as they’re genuinely interesting), you avoid relying too heavily on just one outlet.\nBut maybe the essence is simpler: it’s the sense of novelty. New things bring new energy.\nEpilogue: An “Uncontrollable” Future So what has this article really said? Honestly, I don’t know. Maybe it’s just the product of my confusion.\nBut perhaps that itself is the point—that accepting life’s uncontrollability is the truest way forward. I try to use reason to structure everything, but… no framework of reason can ever explain it all.\nJust like in “state-behavior theory,” you can only know the outcome with 100% certainty if you have all the variables. But how could we ever gather all the variables of life?\nMaybe the impossibility of grasping them is itself one of life’s variables.\n","date":"2025-08-18T18:27:12+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/252/","title":"Adrift in Learning, Misaligned in Life"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by ChatGPT Introduction A few days ago (2025-08-13), I had a dream. In it, the second film of a certain series was titled Phantom Dream, and my name appeared in the credits—though I didn’t know if I was the director or the screenwriter. The title itself wasn’t even original; it was just picked out from two short phrases used by the production studio, just like the first film. But the two films had no connection at all.\nIn the dream, I only saw the movie from the middle. There appeared images of binary-star entanglement, triple-star entanglement, a “second universe,” and then something like a singularity. That singularity triggered a big bang, the universe rebooted, life emerged, and a sprout broke through the soil. Then I woke up.\nAlthough in the dream it was said that this film was somehow related to The Three-Body Problem, from the part I saw, it didn’t feel connected at all. At the test screening I even felt like I might be recognized, and the promotion was boldly carried under the name of The Three-Body Problem. But I don’t think that really matters, so I’ll just skip over it.\nAnalysis I kept thinking about this dream. Binary- and triple-star entanglements are inherently unstable structures, representing contradiction and tension. The singularity and big bang symbolize the point where contradictions become irreconcilable, leading to an explosive conflict. After that, life appears, the sprout pushes through the soil—this is rebirth.\nSo, this whole sequence points to instability, or entanglement that cannot hold. Energy accumulates until it collapses into a singularity, then explodes, and new life begins.\nThoughts The film bore my name, but I didn’t know its contents. And while watching it in the dream, I even felt like I was the main character. To me, it seemed almost like a story about my own life—or about something I went through: various elements tangled together, unstable, and finally pushed by me into an explosion that led to both destruction and rebirth.\nAt the part with the triple-star entanglement, someone—maybe the audience, maybe the scrolling comments—said it was “the hardest frame.” Perhaps that meant the situation was already unstable, yet I still had to trigger it myself. It was a hard decision to make.\nRebirth At first, I thought the dream was hopeful, suggesting that something halfway through my life might turn around. But after more reflection, I realized nothing in my current life seems to be at such a turning point.\nLooking again, starting from the film’s title Phantom Dream, it seems to mean my recent experiences themselves were a “phantom dream.” Maybe I was the one who pierced it, bringing about a kind of rebirth.\nOr perhaps it means I inevitably escalate contradictions until they explode, but in the end, that destruction becomes my transformation.\nRealization I once built myself a rational decision-making system. My life felt like a rehearsal of choices—running through simulations of what might be “better.” During that time, I wasn’t really living; I was mechanically optimizing.\nAs the number of choices grew, I always viewed things from the widest possible range of possibilities. It looked reasonable, but as I realized, my life lost its own flavor. Just like Phantom Dream: I was the director, I was the protagonist, but I didn’t know the plot. I was just watching that movie—watching my life.\nLater, I began prioritizing my feelings, trying to consider what I actually liked. At first it felt refreshing. But gradually, I sank deeper into my emotions, and in doing so, lost my broad rational judgment. That, too, was Phantom Dream—a complete immersion in sentiment. Beautiful, maybe, but in the end just a dream.\nSo, against the unstable backdrop of lost rationality, I sought out a singularity—an end point—to force a psychological transformation and start anew.\nReflection I think this was my soul’s metamorphosis after living through almost purely rational and purely emotional modes. I realized extreme approaches don’t work. Life is inherently tangled; no single measure can define it.\nToo much rationality erases the small details of feeling, while too much emotion turns life chaotic. The balance is hard to hold. But isn’t life itself a kind of “phantom dream”? We are both the director and the protagonist—yet we never know the next scene.\nPostscript This essay itself is pretty chaotic. But isn’t that proof I’m analyzing while still inside the chaos, searching for my own singularity? And this time, the singularity is simply writing it down and publishing it. In that act, my blog breaks its silence and starts anew. 😂\n","date":"2025-08-17T01:13:32+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/251/","title":"Phantom Dream"},{"content":" This article was partially machine translated\nNot everyone who swipes cards is chasing cashback, and not everyone who designs systems is a programmer. Some swipe cards like designers, and design systems like they live life.\n1. Introduction: What is a Card Enthusiast? Let’s start with something I once saw online—the seven favorite hobbies of card enthusiasts:\nNote: “Mainland China” here refers to regions where capital inflow and outflow are restricted.\nFinding ways to spend foreign currency in China Finding ways to spend RMB abroad Finding ways to move RMB out of the country Finding ways to bring foreign currency in Applying for cards that are useless in China Applying for cards that are even more useless abroad Trying to move around money that doesn’t even reach the length of a typical PIN code, across a bunch of nearly useless cards Note: In mainland China, bank PINs are usually 6 digits. This is a self-deprecating joke meaning “my balance doesn’t even reach 6 digits, but I’m still shuffling it like it matters.” May not apply elsewhere.\nIt may sound like a financial game—applying for cards, chasing cashback, reducing fees, optimizing exchanges\u0026hellip; Seems like a bunch of petty tricks.\nBut for true card enthusiasts:\nIt’s not about saving a few bucks—it\u0026rsquo;s about designing an optimal, multi-channel, multi-constraint capital flow system.\nThey’re not milking the system. They’re exploring the architecture of reality, optimizing the structure of everyday life.\n2. What Does a System Architect Actually Do? To become a certified system architect, you need to learn all kinds of jargon—modular decoupling, performance optimization, API specification, and more. But beyond the terms, the real job is simple:\nFaced with complex constraints, allocate resources, design routes, and connect systems to build something stable yet flexible.\nA system architect isn’t just writing beautiful code or drawing diagrams. Their main concern is: will the system work in real-world chaos? For example:\nHow should modules divide responsibilities? How should services interact? How can interfaces be defined for future expansion? How do we locate issues and isolate failures? How do we balance performance and cost under limited resources? Their role is part LEGO builder, part road engineer, part system patcher. Not given a perfect blueprint from the start, they piece things together step-by-step in a broken and messy world.\nIn short, they design systems that run steadily, adapt quickly, and are affordable to maintain. They don’t chase technical perfection—they chase what works. That’s the beauty of system architecture.\nI only learned these things for an exam, but through that process, I rediscovered my passion for card optimization.\n3. The “Architecture Problems” of Card Enthusiasts Card optimization isn’t just “saving a little money.” And system architecture isn’t just “high-end tech design.” Despite different contexts, they both tackle the same core challenge:\nNavigating constraints, managing costs, and designing optimal structures in an uncertain world.\nCard enthusiasts don’t just apply for cards—they design capital flows.\nSystem architects don’t just code—they design control and data flows.\nCard people ask: how do I reduce fees, avoid risk flags, and ensure smooth transactions?\nArchitects ask: how do I reduce failures, scale up, and maintain stability?\nI originally studied architecture for the test, but looking back—it’s the same thinking I used when optimizing my card flows.\nCard World Architecture World Core Logic Fees Latency / Performance Cost Management Channel Limits API Call Restrictions Protocol Compatibility Card Regulations Module Specifications Compliance FX Disparities Cross-platform Overhead Environment Adaptation Card Diversity Tech Stack Diversity Module Integration Bank Risk Controls Security Strategies Risk Management Flow Paths Data Routing Architectural Routing Card optimization isn’t exploiting loopholes—it’s designing capital flow architectures.\nThey aren’t “doing things.” They’re building structures: not just finding the best cashback card, but designing a path that moves funds with minimal cost and maximum efficiency.\nThey don’t just ask “can it be done,” but “is it elegant.”\nCard optimization is solving a constrained shortest-path problem, just like service topology design is about optimizing module coupling under SLA limits.\nThe difference between them? Just different application domains.\n4. System Practice Through Personal Exploration Others chase cashback. I’m studying the ecosystem.\nEvery card enthusiast’s path is unique. We each deal with different banks, currencies, and lifestyles.\nThe fun doesn’t lie in copying others—but in finding your own optimal flow through trial and error, grounded in real context.\nI started off just trying to save a little on fees. But after digging through endless documentation, I realized: every bank had its own transfer policies, time windows, restrictions. Some offered free morning transfers, others were fast but limited to specific currencies. Some would randomly block transfers. It felt like a fog-of-war map—I had to explore, unlock nodes, and build routes.\nAfter countless small tests, I built a working, cost-effective flow tailored to myself. I avoided high-fee routes, optimized timing, and even exploited currency fluctuations for marginal gains.\nSome goals seemed impossible at first—like sending funds to countries with little infrastructure. But I eventually figured out how: crypto deposits, direct virtual currency payments, fiat-to-stablecoin automation, specialized remittance apps bypassing banks\u0026hellip; I made the impossible possible.\nThis transition—from “unreachable” to “path unlocked”—felt exactly like rebuilding a network architecture.\nI wasn’t just transferring money. I was redefining the structure of value transmission.\nSounds complex? It’s really just a classic systems design problem:\nHow do systems communicate and transfer data? How do we handle format (currency) conversions? Which nodes are reliable? Which paths are low-latency and low-failure? How do we move a “data packet” (money) through protocols (remittance channels) to the destination? Can it feel seamless from the user’s (my) perspective? That’s architecture: not feature-building, but designing a coherent, maintainable, scalable system.\nEach card is a node; each interface is a protocol. Every iteration? A tiny architectural optimization.\nIt’s route planning + interface negotiation + user experience. Sounds familiar, architect?\nCard enthusiasts aren’t just saving money. They’re reconstructing the world’s financial logic and taking control.\n5. Architectural Literacy Forged Through Card Craft Through every route choice, failed experiment, cost balancing act, and risk-management adjustment, card enthusiasts are honing a kind of architectural mindset. No servers, no code—but plenty of real-world structure tuning and efficiency refinement. That process? It\u0026rsquo;s hands-on system design.\nAll these behaviors, over time, naturally evolve into core architectural instincts:\nCapability Real-World Manifestation Architectural Principle Rule Familiarity Mastering bank limits and terms Documentation Literacy Integration Coordinating multi-card workflows System Integration Thinking Cost Awareness Minimizing transaction fees Performance/Cost Tradeoff Modeling Mapping optimal card flow paths Structural Modeling Risk Management Multi-account, failover logic High Availability Design Aesthetic Sense Making money “move elegantly” Engineering Beauty In many ways, card enthusiasts are simulating what it means to think like a systems architect—using the real world as their playground.\n6. My Reflection Fees are the enemy. Channels are sacred. Paths are art.\nI didn’t become a card enthusiast because I love swiping cards—I became one because through each experiment, I found beauty in structure. We may not write code or run servers, but every money transfer, every optimized flow—it’s all a personal exercise in system design.\nFrom prepping for the architecture certification to building my daily financial routes, I’ve come to realize:\nWhat I enjoy isn’t just getting things done—it’s making the path elegant.\nWhat others see as petty tricks, I see as system aesthetics.\nWhat others call loophole hunters, I call life architects.\nCardcraft isn’t just about saving money—it’s a real-world sandbox to train your sense of system design: visualizing problems, iterating solutions, aligning logic with beauty.\nIt’s not a waste of time. It’s a tactile, tangible, deeply personal “practice space” for designing real-world systems.\nIt’s not about saving money. It’s about skill-building.\nIt’s not about invention. It’s about choosing the right structure.\nWhether it’s designing systems or optimizing card flows, the point isn’t how much you saved or how many lines you wrote—it’s how much better you understand how the world works.\nAnd I? I’m the kind of person who stands in front of an ATM for 10 minutes—just to calculate the optimal fee path. Maybe I don’t have a server to deploy, but I’m still architecting.\nConclusion: Life Is the Ultimate Architecture Every time we swipe a card, transfer money, evaluate a route, or make a combination decision—we\u0026rsquo;re engaging in an invisible act of system design.\nArchitecture isn\u0026rsquo;t just about servers and APIs. Sometimes, it\u0026rsquo;s hidden between wallets, bank cards, and payment methods.\nAt the end of the card optimization path, perhaps what we find is not a loophole hunter—\n—but a life architect in disguise.\nAppendix: My Capital Flow in Code This code isn’t meant to be executable—it’s a model of how I think about my real-world money flows. It’s how I express everyday logistics through architectural language.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 // My cross-border capital flow (illustrative) func RouteCNYtoJPY(CNY float64) JPY float64 { HKD := BOCExchange(CNY, to=\u0026#34;HKD\u0026#34;) log.Printf(\u0026#34;Exchanged %.2f CNY to %.2f HKD\u0026#34;, CNY, HKD) Transfer(HKD, from=\u0026#34;BOC\u0026#34;, to=\u0026#34;BOCHK\u0026#34;, by=\u0026#34;pbservice\u0026#34;) log.Println(\u0026#34;Transferred via pbservice → BOCHK\u0026#34;) Transfer(HKD, from=\u0026#34;BOCHK\u0026#34;, to=\u0026#34;Wise\u0026#34;, by=\u0026#34;fpservice\u0026#34;) log.Println(\u0026#34;Transferred via fps → Wise\u0026#34;) JPY := WiseConvert(HKD, to=\u0026#34;JPY\u0026#34;) log.Printf(\u0026#34;Converted %.2f HKD to %.2f JPY via Wise\u0026#34;, HKD, JPY) Deposit(JPY, to=\u0026#34;Revolut\u0026#34;, with=\u0026#34;ApplePay\u0026#34;) return JPY } A code snippet built not for execution, but for expression—a symbolic blueprint connecting everyday money logic to architectural thinking.\nDisclaimer: This article is for entertainment and personal documentation purposes only.

I stopped in April 2025.\nMy last entry: ¥0\nThe Beginning: To Save Money and Gain Control It all started very simply — I wanted to control my spending and build better financial awareness. And in the beginning, it really worked. I successfully curbed some of my bad spending habits.\nThe Process: Stepping Into the World of Optimization and Card Collecting Gradually, in pursuit of “better” consumption, I started comparing everything, looking for the optimal choice. At first, it was just comparing product prices. Later, it expanded to payment methods, tools, and eventually to bank promotions and card applications.\nI applied for cards for discounts, then for convenience, and eventually just for collecting them. Step by step, I had fallen deep into the card-collecting world.\nWhat started as saving money, turned into convenience, and ended up becoming card collecting.\nThe Backfire: When Accounting Became a Burden And so, accounting itself slowly became a burden. More and more accounts, more and more complex scenarios — the time cost and mental cost of bookkeeping had long exceeded its actual benefits.\nThere were times I spent hours researching just to save a few bucks. At first, that felt fun. But after doing it over and over, finding the optimal solution no longer excited me — it just left me feeling empty.\nThe Change: From Seeking The Best to Seeking Comfort Maybe I’ve changed. My approach to consumption has changed too.\nFrom “maximize savings” to “close enough, as long as I’m comfortable.”\nI realized I had already broken through my original spending limits, yet I didn’t lose control. On the contrary, I came to understand more deeply: compared to saving money, my time and my happiness mattered more.\nThe Reflection: Why Am I Even Keeping Accounts? Because of bookkeeping, I started to:\nConstantly dig through records because I had too many accounts Create new accounts in the app frequently due to currency conversions Spend a long time hesitating over whether I should buy something Have my mood ruined during outings with friends over spending details That made me reflect — Why am I even doing this?\nIs it really worth it for the so-called “gains” from bookkeeping?\nThe Decision: Letting Go, Reset, Move On So I tried to let go, to not fuss over the details, and simply asked myself:\n“Am I happy?”\nAnd the result was — yes, I was really happy. And my spending wasn’t as high as I imagined either.\nPerhaps my habits had already trained me to naturally compare prices. Or maybe, emotional value is something that can never be measured by discounts.\nTherefore, I think it’s time to let go.\nAccounting has fulfilled its mission.\nIt’s no longer a tool, but a shackle.\nHabits are meant to improve life.\nIf they can no longer be sustained by passion, and instead get in the way of living, then it’s time to learn to say goodbye.\nThe Ending: Thank You, and Keep Living Giving up a habit I’ve maintained for two years is indeed a little bittersweet.\nBut maybe this is also a part of life. Nothing stays with us forever, but as long as the time spent together was beautiful, that’s enough.\nPerhaps I’ve lost a symbolic tool that made me feel like “I’m good at saving money.”\nBut more than that, I hope my future self won’t rely on numbers and records for a sense of security, but instead, live with true ease and freedom.\nFrom being in control, to flowing into the unknown.\nI hope I can adapt soon.\nAnd I hope I can spend the saved time on things that are more meaningful and more joyful.\nThe Last Entry, ¥0 Leaving a short note here.\nThank you to myself for two years of dedicated tracking.\nFrom now on, I hope to spend the saved time on things that are more meaningful and joyful.\nAnd just like that, I archived this experience.\nRecording ends, but life is only just beginning.\n","date":"2025-04-14T16:23:48+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/244/","title":"From Saving Money, To Living Life, To Saying Goodbye"},{"content":" This article was partially machine translated\nIntroduction Is there a a way to study language listening without feeling like you\u0026rsquo;re studying, sometimes you can listen to repeatedly and try shadowing?

If an input is H (High), connect from its original line (first column). Then, connect these to an AND gate. Repeat this for all underlined entries from step 2.\nConnect all AND gate outputs to an OR gate.\nCircuit Simplification Digital circuit design flow: Problem definition -\u0026gt; Truth table -\u0026gt; Simplification -\u0026gt; Circuit diagram.\nSimplify using Karnaugh Maps (K-maps).\nConvert the truth table into a K-map. When building the truth table, columns usually start with the most significant bit, e.g., [C, B, A], with the result Z. A K-map is a 2D truth table, typically using 0s and 1s for logic levels. For three inputs, you might use B, A for rows/columns and C for the other axis, then fill the 2D table with the results.\nK-map Basics for Simplification K-maps wrap around horizontally and vertically because adjacent cells (including wrap-around) differ by only one bit.\nSimplification Process\nGroup adjacent 1s together. Find commonalities among the variables within each group (rows and columns). If a common variable\u0026rsquo;s value is 0, use its complement (e.g., A becomes !A). Example\nC\\BA 00 01 11 10 0 1 1 1 In the table above, the commonalities are C=0 and A=1, so the expression is !C * A.\nSimplification Rules\nGroups must be rectangular (or square) with sides of length 1, 2, or 4. Groups can overlap. Aim for the fewest, largest possible groups. Note: Groups can span across the edges (left-right, top-bottom wrap-around). If no further groups can be formed, the circuit is as simplified as possible.\nAfter simplification, draw the circuit diagram. Just follow the circuit drawing steps (starting from step 3 in the previous section) for all derived expressions.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Cares in Circuits When defining inputs, due to the nature of binary numbers, there might be \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t care\u0026rdquo; inputs that don\u0026rsquo;t need consideration.\nFor instance, if inputs represent months (1-12) using four binary bits, there are 16 possible inputs. Numbers like 0, 13, 14, and 15 are \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t cares\u0026rdquo; because they\u0026rsquo;re invalid month values.\nThese \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t care\u0026rdquo; inputs can be represented by \u0026lsquo;-\u0026rsquo; in a K-map and can be included in groups to further simplify the expression.\nBuilding Sequential Circuits Sequential circuits require both combinational logic and flip-flops.\nRegarding the \u0026ldquo;memory\u0026rdquo; in sequential circuits: Think of a vending machine. It remembers the total amount inserted. Without memory, it would only recognize the last coin\u0026rsquo;s value.\nA flip-flop, like a clock (CLK), is introduced. Inputs only affect outputs when the CLK is triggered; otherwise, the output remains unchanged.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take drawing an electronic die as an example.\nDraw the state transition diagram. How does the electronic die change over time? If \u0026ldquo;stop\u0026rdquo; is low, it cycles from 1 to 6, then back to 1. If \u0026ldquo;stop\u0026rdquo; is high, it stays at a specific point.\nRepresent states using binary numbers. Represent each situation or state using binary, then create a state transition table. Design the circuit from the state transition table, using D flip-flops to store states.\nDesign the combinational circuit. Determining the next state from the current state is, essentially, a combinational circuit.\n","date":"2022-12-04T16:54:29+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/80/","title":"My Thoughts on \"Manga Guide to Digital Electronics\""},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash-lite Deploying on Windows 11.

Theoretically, it can be replicated on any platform that supports Docker.\nAdjusted the domain to link.start.icu.

Although the final result was, well, something, I learned quite a bit along the way.\nThe Start Searching openwrt connect shenlan authentication on the browser led me to a post on Ensine Wireless Forum . In the replies, I found an open-source project: coffeehat/BIT-srun-login-script . This project showed me there was a Go version supporting multiple platforms, including OpenWRT, so I started tinkering.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the project author\u0026rsquo;s article: Analysis and Python Implementation of Shenlan Campus Network Login - BIT Version Before Tinkering OpenWRT versions didn\u0026rsquo;t provide compiled binaries (IPK files). My limited skills meant I couldn\u0026rsquo;t understand the README. I asked a classmate, who told me it was a Linux command. However, after trying it, I realized it was for compiling the Linux kernel. I gave up on trying on my physical machine and started using a virtual machine.\nReference: Building a custom kernel/zh-cn - Fedora Project Wiki Let\u0026rsquo;s Tinker A friend sent me configuration - How to fix make error \u0026ldquo;No rule to make target \u0026lsquo;menuconfig\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; when building a kernel for Beagleboard? - Unix \u0026amp; Linux Stack Exchange , so I followed its advice.\nSetting Up a Virtual Machine I\u0026rsquo;m using Fedora\u0026rsquo;s built-in virtualization software, \u0026ldquo;Boxes.\u0026rdquo; First, I tried installing CentOS 8. My ISO was on an external drive, so I mounted it and selected it. It failed to create the VM. I tried CentOS 7, failed. Then Ubuntu, failed.\nAfter multiple failures, I almost doubted the software, even though I\u0026rsquo;d successfully created a Windows 10 VM with it before. I opened the error log, but it was gibberish. However, I noticed a Chinese character in a path. I changed the path to English and tried again. Failed.\nThe next day, I thought, since it\u0026rsquo;s about kernel compilation, maybe Kali Linux would work. I copied the Kali ISO from my USB to my computer. Although the installation ultimately failed, it ran successfully. Did the system need to be local?\nSo, I copied the CentOS 7 ISO to ~/Documents/ and the installation succeeded. Since I only needed to compile an IPK, I used the root user.\nConnecting to the Network I assumed creating a Linux VM in Linux would automatically share the network. So, I directly ran wget https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.19.6.tar.xz. The result was \u0026ldquo;cannot resolve host.\u0026rdquo; Using ifconfig, I saw no IP address.\nI followed the guide Setting Static IP in a Virtual Machine (CentOS Example) to get the VM online. For file modification, I just needed to change ONBOOT to yes and add two DNS entries.\nInstalling Git After getting online, I installed Git using yum install git. Then, I configured my name and email.\n1 git config --global user.name \u0026#34;Name\u0026#34; 1 git config --global user.email \u0026#34;email@example.com\u0026#34; Transferring Files I continued trying to download the Linux kernel using wget. I tried three or four times, with downloads failing around 50% and at very slow speeds.\nNote: Using wget -c URL allows for resuming interrupted downloads.\nThen, the \u0026ldquo;Boxes\u0026rdquo; software seemed to support direct drag-and-drop. I downloaded the file on my main computer and dragged it over. It failed. The file wasn\u0026rsquo;t transferred. Considering the target location was ~/Downloads/ and I was using the root account, I followed Adding Users and Administrator Users in Linux to create a new user. (I almost ran the step to delete the user.)\nI switched to the new user with su username, created the ~/Downloads/ directory, and dragged the file again. Still failed.\nI tried using Boxes\u0026rsquo; sharing feature to share my computer\u0026rsquo;s ~/Public folder. No matter how I tried, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t see it in the VM. (I suspect this software only works well with RHEL and Fedora.)\nSSH Transfer Then I remembered SSH transfer (because ftp wasn\u0026rsquo;t installed, and I was too lazy to install it).\nI enabled SSH on my local machine and then used the scp command to transfer files via SSH.\n1 scp username@servername:/path/filename ~/Downloads/ First, I needed the IP address. In the VM, I ran ip route and got the IP: 10.0.2.2.\nThen, I used the scp command to transfer.\nExtracting Files I used the tar command to extract the files.\n1 tar -xzvf filename.tar.xz Uh oh, this isn\u0026rsquo;t a gzip compressed file. How do I extract it?\nSSH Transfer I\u0026rsquo;ll use SSH transfer again. Just add -r to the scp command to transfer directories.\nFirst Attempt Following the steps, I placed the extracted files in /usr/src/. I copied the config file from /boot to /usr/src/linux-5.19.6/.config. However, whether I put the config file in .config/ or .config, the make menuconfig command still wouldn\u0026rsquo;t run.\nConclusion Tinkering failed. I\u0026rsquo;ll try again later.\nHowever, while writing this article, I noticed the original post suggested running Python directly on OpenWRT. I\u0026rsquo;ll try that if I have time.\nAnother Attempt I consulted a friend who had successfully connected to the school network (though he used a regular router). He changed his router\u0026rsquo;s MAC address to his computer\u0026rsquo;s. Then, when he plugged in the network cable, the authentication page automatically forwarded to his computer. After authenticating, he had internet access, but it was through Ruijie\u0026rsquo;s web authentication.\nConsidering Shenlan uses Portal authentication (web page authentication), and it\u0026rsquo;s web-based, can I authenticate by modifying HTTP packets? Are there Linux commands to send HTTP packets? I searched and found curl and wget can simulate get and post requests. (So I opened Fiddler to capture packets, trying to replicate the authentication process.)\nJust kidding. I connected my router to the school network, then connected my computer to the router via Ethernet cable. I entered the IP address of the authentication page, completed authentication, and the router had internet access.\nSimulating HTTP GET or POST Requests with Linux Commands Although I didn\u0026rsquo;t end up using them, I\u0026rsquo;ll document them since I found them.\nGET Request curl 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ## If the URL points to a file, it can be downloaded directly curl URL ## Display all information curl -i URL ## Display only header information curl -l URL ## Show the full parsing process of the GET request curl -v URL wget 1 wget URL POST Request curl 1 2 3 4 5 6 ## Use the -d parameter to include parameters in the request curl -d \u0026#34;param1=value1\u0026amp;param2=value2\u0026#34; \u0026#34;URL\u0026#34; curl -d \u0026#39;param1=value1\u0026amp;param2=value2\u0026#39; -X POST URL curl -d \u0026#39;param1=value1\u0026#39; -d \u0026#39;param2=value2\u0026#39; -X POST URL wget 1 2 ## Use the --post-data parameter wget --post-data \u0026#39;user=name\u0026amp;passwd=passwd\u0026#39; URL Another Conclusion Sometimes, you can overcomplicate things.

(Note: Reading the book and writing this took 5 days).\nHTTP Message Structure There are two types of HTTP messages: Request and Response.\nHTTP Request An HTTP request consists of three parts: the Request Line, the Request Headers, and the Body.\nThe first line (Request Line) contains the Method, URI, and protocol version. Example: GET https://blog.yexca.net/ HTTP/2 The second part is the Headers. The third part is the Body. Note: There is an empty line between the Headers and the Body.\nHTTP Response The structure of an HTTP response is basically the same as a request, also divided into three parts: the Response Line (Status Line), the Response Headers, and the Body.\nThe first line contains the protocol version, status code, and status message. Example: HTTP/2 200 The second part is the Headers. The third part is the Body. Note: There is an empty line between the Headers and the Body.\nHTTP Methods and Status Codes URL Format URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It\u0026rsquo;s used to describe the address of a resource on the Internet.\nThe basic format of a URL is:\nschema://host[:port#]/path/.../[?query-string][#anchor]\nAttribute Description schema Specifies the underlying protocol (e.g., http, https, ftp) host The IP address or domain name of the HTTP server port# The default port for HTTP is 80; it can be omitted if using the default. Otherwise, it must be specified path The path to the resource query-string Data sent to the HTTP server anchor An internal page hyperlink HTTP Request Methods No. Method Description 1 GET Requests a specific resource and returns the entity body 2 HEAD Similar to GET, but the response has no body; used to retrieve headers 3 POST Submits data to be processed (e.g., form submission or file upload). Data is included in the body. May create new resources or modify existing ones 4 PUT Replaces the content of the target resource with the uploaded data 5 DELETE Requests the server to delete the specified resource GET vs. POST GET data is appended to the URL, separated by a ? (query-string, key-value pairs), and parameters are connected with \u0026amp;. POST puts data in the HTTP message Body. GET has size limits (due to browser URL length limits). POST has no size limits for data. In code, GET typically uses Request.QueryString to get variables, while POST uses Request.Form. HTTP Status Codes Status codes are in the HTTP response. The server uses them to tell the client what happened. They are divided into five categories.\nStatus Code Defined Range Category 1XX 100–101 Informational: Request received, continue processing 2XX 200–206 Success: Request successfully received, understood, and accepted 3XX 300–305 Redirection: Further action needed to complete the request 4XX 400–415 Client Error: Request has bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled 5XX 500–505 Server Error: Server failed to fulfill a valid request Common Status Codes Name Meaning 200 OK: Server successfully processed the request 301/302 Moved Permanently / Found (Redirect): The URL has moved. The response should contain a Location URL 304 Not Modified: Client\u0026rsquo;s cached version is up to date; use the cache 404 Not Found: Resource not found 401 Unauthorized: Authentication required 501 Not Implemented (Source mentions Internal Server Error): Server encountered an error 206 (Partial Content) The 206 status code means the server successfully processed a partial GET request. This is used for resumable downloads or online video streaming.\nExample of a video request:\nBrowser sends GET with Header: Range: bytes=5303296-5336063. Server returns 206 with Header: Content-Range: bytes 5303296-5336063/12129376. 301 vs. 302 (Redirects) After receiving 301 or 302, the browser makes a new request to the URL in the Location header.\n301: Old address is permanently moved. Search engines transfer authority to the new URL. (e.g., switching domains). 302: Old address still exists; the redirect is temporary. (e.g., redirecting to a login page). 304 (Not Modified) Indicates the cached version is still valid and can be used.\n400 (Bad Request) Syntax error in the client request. The server cannot understand it (e.g., malformed form data or corrupted Cookies).\n401 (Unauthorized) Authentication error. Used when HTTP Basic Authentication is required but the Authorization header is missing or invalid.\n404 (Not Found) Server cannot find the resource. Can also be used to hide a resource (refuse request without reason). For example, BV1AB4y1D7Ft is only visible if logged in and favorited; otherwise, it returns 404.\n403 (Forbidden) The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it. Unlike 401, re-authenticating makes no difference.\n500 (Internal Server Error) Generic server error. Could be code bugs, DB connection issues, uncaught exceptions, or null pointers.\n503 (Server Unavailable) Server is temporarily unable to handle the request (overloaded or down for maintenance).\nFull list of status codes Visit: HTTP Status Codes - Runoob HTTP Headers Headers use the \u0026ldquo;key: value\u0026rdquo; format, one per line.\nCache-related Headers Both requests and responses use headers for caching. Caching allows retrieving files from local storage instead of the original server.\nCookie A type of HTTP cache/storage. Key-value format (e.g., ip_country=CN). Browsers send them via the \u0026ldquo;Cookie\u0026rdquo; header; servers set them via \u0026ldquo;Set-Cookie\u0026rdquo;.\nAccept Media types the client can handle. Accept: text/html means the browser wants HTML. * is a wildcard.\nAccept-Encoding Related to compression. The browser tells the server which compression algorithms it supports (e.g., Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate).\nAccept-Language The languages the client understands (e.g., Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8,zh-CN;q=0.6). Note: language $\\neq$ character set.\nUser-Agent Identifies the client\u0026rsquo;s OS, browser version, engine, etc. Example: User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:103.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/103.0.\nReferer Indicates the source page the user came from. Used for analytics and hotlink protection.\nConnection In HTTP/1.1, Connection: Keep-Alive is default. It keeps the TCP connection open for multiple requests.\nHost Specifies the target host and port. Port 80 is usually hidden.\nHTTP Caching Caching exists at the browser, server, and proxy levels. It reduces redundant data, saves time, and lowers server load.\nJudging Cache Freshness The server checks cache validity in two ways:\nLast-Modified / If-Modified-Since: Browser sends the last modification time. If the file hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed, the server returns 304. ETag / If-None-Match: Browser sends a unique hash (ETag) of the file content. Cache Headers Request Headers Name Description Cache-Control: max-age=0 Force revalidation If-Modified-Since Last modification time of the cached file If-None-Match ETag value of the cached file Cache-Control: no-cache Do not use cache Pragma: no-cache Do not use cache (Legacy) Response Headers Name Description Cache-Control: public Can be cached by public proxies/users Cache-Control: private Cache only for specific user Cache-Control: no-cache Must validate with server before using cache Cache-Control: no-store Never cache (for sensitive data) Cache-Control: max-age=60 Cache expires in 60s (relative) Date Time response was sent Expires Absolute expiration time Last-Modified Last modification time on server Etag Unique hash of the server file Note: Cache-Control takes precedence over Expires.\nETag Entity Tag. A hash string representing the file state. It solves issues where Last-Modified isn\u0026rsquo;t precise enough (it only goes down to the second) or where modification times change but content doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nForcing No Cache Ctrl+Shift+R forces a refresh, adding Cache-Control: no-cache to the request.\nDirect Cache Use Typing the URL in the address bar usually results in a \u0026ldquo;cache hit\u0026rdquo; if valid, without even checking the server.\nCompression and URL Encoding HTTP compression reduces the size of text content (HTML, JS, CSS) during transfer.\nCompression Process Browser sends Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate. Server generates response, compresses the Body with gzip, updates Content-Length, and adds Content-Encoding: gzip. Browser receives response and decompresses it. Note: Browsers usually don\u0026rsquo;t compress requests.\nEncoding Types Encoding Description gzip GNU zip compress UNIX compress deflate zlib format identity No encoding (Default) gzip is the most efficient and widely used.\nDeep Dive into Cookies HTTP is stateless. Each request is independent. Sessions solve this by maintaining state between the browser and server.\nSessions vs. Cookies Server creates a session and sends the Session ID to the browser. Browser stores the ID and sends it back in subsequent requests. Server identifies the user via the ID. Cookies are the mechanism browsers use to store this ID.\nWhat are Cookies? Small data stored as key=value pairs, separated by semicolons. Primarily used for authentication, user preferences, and ad tracking. Some regions (EU) have laws requiring user consent for cookies.\nCookie Attributes Expires: When it expires. If omitted, it\u0026rsquo;s a session cookie (deleted when browser closes). Path: The scope of the cookie. / means the whole site. HttpOnly: Prevents JavaScript from reading the cookie. Essential for security against XSS. Categories Session Cookie: Temporary, stored in memory. Persistent Cookie: Stored on disk with an expiration date. Used for \u0026ldquo;auto-login.\u0026rdquo; HTTP Basic Authentication Used by some desktop apps and routers. The client sends username:password encoded in Base64 via the Authorization header.\nProcess:\nServer returns 401 and a WWW-Authenticate header. Browser prompts for credentials. Browser sends Base64 encoded credentials. Disadvantages Stateless: Every request must be authenticated. Insecure: Base64 is easily reversed. Must use HTTPS. No Logout: Cannot log out without closing the browser or clearing history. Vulnerable to replay attacks. Digest Authentication An improved version of Basic Auth. It uses hashes (MD5) and a \u0026ldquo;nonce\u0026rdquo; (number used once) from the server to prevent password sniffing and replay attacks.\nReferences “Graphing HTTP” Summary - yexca\u0026rsquo;Blog HTTP Status Codes - Runoob Cookie locations in IE/Firefox/Chrome Replay Attack - Wikipedia What is a REST API?

Next, change the repo\u0026rsquo;s owner to the git user:\n1 chown -R git:git runoob.git Clone Repository 1 2 3 git clone git@YourIP:RepoDirectory // For example git clone git@127.0.0.1:/home/gitrepo/repo.git Sync Directory The auto-sync feature uses Git hooks.\nNavigate to your repo directory: /home/gitrepo/repo.git\n1 2 cd /home/gitrepo/repo.git cd hooks Create and edit the post-receive file:\n1 vi post-receive Add the following content to the file:\n1 2 #!/bin/sh git --work-tree=SyncTargetDirectory --git-dir=RepoLocation checkout -f For example:\n1 2 #!/bin/sh git --work-tree=/home/www/hexo --git-dir=/home/gitrepo/repo.git checkout -f Then set read/write permissions for the file:\n1 chmod +x post-receive Change the owner of the repo.git directory to the git user.\n1 chown -R git:git /home/gitrepo/repo.git Update Code If you\u0026rsquo;re sure nothing\u0026rsquo;s changed and you just need to update local code, simply use:\n1 git pull The proper workflow:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 // Check local branch file status to avoid conflicts during update. git status // If files are modified, you can revert them to the original state; if files need to be updated to the server, you should merge to the server first, then update locally. git checkout – [file name] // Check current branch status. git branch // If it\u0026#39;s a local branch, you need to switch to the remote branch on the server. git checkout remote branch git pull Other Commands 1 2 3 4 git branch // Check branches git checkout aaa // Switch to branch \u0026#39;aaa\u0026#39; git branch aaa // Create branch \u0026#39;aaa\u0026#39; git checkout -b aaa // Create branch \u0026#39;aaa\u0026#39; locally and switch to it. The branch will only be created on the server when you push. Disable Shell Login for Git User For security, we need to prevent the git user from logging in via shell. You can do this by editing /etc/passwd:\n1 vi /etc/passwd Change this:\n1 git:x:1004:1004::/home/git:/bin/bash To this:\n1 git:x:1004:1004::/home/git:/usr/bin/git-shell This way, the git user can still use Git normally via SSH, but can\u0026rsquo;t log into the shell.\nReferences Linux chown Command - Runoob Tutorial Git Server Setup - Runoob Tutorial Git - Generating Your SSH Public Key Introduction to SSH Keys and Their Use in Git - Jianshu Git - Getting Git on a Server Git: Updating Local Code - ftToday\u0026rsquo;s Blog - CSDN How to Set Up a Hexo Blog on a Server - Alibaba Cloud Developer Community Linux Permissions Explained (chmod, 600, 644, 700, 711, 755, 777, 4755, 6755, 7755) - Lin20\u0026rsquo;s Blog - CSDN Detailed Analysis of Linux /etc/passwd file - Jtianlin - Blog Garden ","date":"2022-08-13T10:28:50+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/57/","title":"Set Up Git Server and Sync to a Specific Directory"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview This article was written by Hiyoung Original article: https://blog.hiyoung.icu/2022/08/11/607cac6fe835/ Most mainstream streaming platforms support embedding code for external links. However, as of August 11, 2022, Bilibili\u0026rsquo;s (when is it shutting down?) default embed link defaults to 360P and doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow quality adjustments. It’s pretty frustrating compared to YouTube.

By the time I actually understood it, RSS was already on the decline. Projects like RSSHub were keeping the flame alive, but I eventually gave up on it due to frequent connection issues. However, as I\u0026rsquo;ve discovered more blogs, I\u0026rsquo;ve returned to RSS to stay updated and keep track of what I\u0026rsquo;ve read.\nWhat is RSS? RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication. It\u0026rsquo;s a format specification for web feeds. Websites use it to provide titles, summaries, or full articles to subscribers. Users can aggregate these links into a single tool to read everything in one place.\nIn other words, while mainstream media pushes content to us (passive consumption), RSS is about actively seeking knowledge. You find your own sources, and the feed only shows what you actually subscribed to.\nWhy use RSS? Pick up your phone, open any news app, and the homepage is nothing but \u0026ldquo;recommendations.\u0026rdquo; Between infinite scrolling and big-data algorithms, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to waste a whole day on low-quality, one-sided content. I hate that feeling of time slipping away. I believe relaxation should be intentional, not passive. Using RSS is my way of resisting the \u0026ldquo;information cocoon.\u0026rdquo;\nOn a small scale, it\u0026rsquo;s about marking unread articles and following blogs I care about. On a larger scale, as recommendation algorithms get more precise, they limit our horizons. RSS helps maintain the ability to actively seek information and learn.\nHow to use it First, you need an RSS reader. I use QuiteRSS , which is open source.\nNext, you need subscription feeds. You\u0026rsquo;ll have to find these yourself. If a site doesn\u0026rsquo;t explicitly provide one, check RSSHub (ensure your network connection is stable).\nHow to find RSS feeds: How to find the RSS feed URL for Feedzy RSS Feeds For example, this site\u0026rsquo;s feed is: https://blog.yexca.net/feed.xml To check if a link is a valid feed: Feed Validator for Atom and RSS Just copy the feed URL, open your software, and create a new source.\nAfterword I had high hopes for this post, but when I actually sat down to write, I found it hard to express exactly what I was feeling. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ve been \u0026ldquo;poisoned\u0026rdquo; by too much low-quality web content for too long—I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten how to write properly.\nI had a lot of thoughts before starting, but they didn\u0026rsquo;t quite make it to the page. It is what it is.\nReferences / Recommended Reading What is the RSS for HACG?

It\u0026rsquo;s a retelling, so some details might not be exact.\nMission Brief Passed a test from some shadowy figure, got HackShop access, and then the first mission dropped.\nThe mission brief: \u0026ldquo;The client wants the login credentials of the user Daronane. The remote ip of the victim is 54.44.37.52. It\u0026rsquo;s important that you access the correct machine behind the public ip. The victim\u0026rsquo;s ip LAN is 172.16.6.7\u0026rdquo;\nMission Analysis Target: Daronane\u0026rsquo;s login. Victim\u0026rsquo;s public IP: 54.44.37.52. LAN IP: 172.16.6.7.\nInitial Probe Following Grey Hack Single Player Game Guide (1) - MapleGe \u0026rsquo;s method, I tried\u0026hellip;\nFirst, whois command for the admin email: Eggett@sabmi.net. Sent a \u0026ldquo;Login issue\u0026rdquo; email. Got Daronane\u0026rsquo;s password: pierra.\nTried ssh Daronane@pierra 54.44.37.52 to connect to 54.44.37.52. Failed. Error: incorrect user/password.\nFigured I mistyped (manual input, right?). Tried a few more times, even copy-pasting. Still incorrect user/password. Gave up on that.\nBrowsed the IP. No clues, just \u0026ldquo;Metlifegroup. Everything you need for your tech company\u0026rdquo; and a pic (Raspberry Pi?). Guessed it was a forum, and Daronane a user there?\nGame Localization Remembered missing some Exploits tutorial info when hitting HackShop. Searched for game localization. Found [简体中文](simplified Chinese) on the Workshop, subscribed, restarted. UI still English.\nFound Workshop download: steam_folder\\steamapps\\workshop\\content\\605230\\2825584160. README.md said to drop its contents into C:\\Users\\%UserName%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Loading Home\\Grey Hack\\ .\nActually, just custom_lang.json in that folder was enough.\nRestarted the game, hit language on the left, picked Chinese. Localized.\nReading the Manual Read the Exploits section in the localized manual (tbh, it felt almost the same as unlocalized). Still couldn\u0026rsquo;t wrap my head around it.\nFurther Exploration Kept digging for guides, found nada. Then hit Grey Hack: A Relatively Simple Mission - Bilibili .\nThe term \u0026ldquo;script kiddie\u0026rdquo; in the article clicked: Exploits are basically real-world attack scripts.\nMisguided Exploration Grabbed scanlib and scanrouter from HackShop.\nRan scanlib 54.44.37.52. Output: Missing metaxploit. No idea what that meant.\nnmap 54.44.37.52 showed two open ports: 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP).\nscanrouter revealed Kernel_router.so:V1.0.0 on the server. Searched for scripts, found one: \u0026ldquo;Get access to a shell\u0026rdquo;, no requirements.\nDownloaded it to /home/yexca/hacktool. Navigated there, ran KernelRouterAccess 54.44.37.52. Error: Can't find metaxploit library in the /lib path or the current folder.\nNote: Initially, I didn\u0026rsquo;t rename this script. Later, I renamed it to KernelRouterAccess for clarity in this post. Other scripts mentioned here were also renamed after initial download, differing from their store names.\nError pointed to a missing file. /lib? Was the target server missing the file, thus couldn\u0026rsquo;t recognize it and grant access?\nRethinking nmap showed ports 22/80. My guess: victim\u0026rsquo;s a forum user. So, HackShop for an HTTP script. Found one: \u0026ldquo;Grant access to the file /etc/passwd and decipher its contents.\u0026rdquo; Requirement: \u0026ldquo;Minimum number of 1 users registered in the computer\u0026rdquo;. Forum implied multiple users, unlikely they\u0026rsquo;d dev as root.\nDownloaded the script, ran HttpPasswd 54.44.37.52 80. Same error: Can't find metaxploit library in the /lib path or the current folder.\nNo surprise there. scanrouter only found Kernel_router.so:V1.0.0, no libhttp.so or anything similar.\nPicked the HTTP script because that article said: \u0026ldquo;Just get the mission done; no remote connection needed, and local script execution leaves no traces.\u0026rdquo;\nOkay, let\u0026rsquo;s retry SSH. HackShop for SSH scripts. Found one: \u0026ldquo;Take advantage of a vulnerability in the ssh service to inject a new password to a registered user.\u0026rdquo; Requirement: \u0026ldquo;Any user logged in the computer.\u0026rdquo; Devs would have logged in, so this should work.\nDownloaded, ran SSHPasswd 54.44.37.52 22. Still hit with Can't find metaxploit library in the /lib path or the current folder.\nWTF??? Is their /lib totally empty? Am I supposed to try every script type to map /lib contents? I\u0026rsquo;ll go broke!\nOn the Right Track Hit the search engine for guides. Nothing.\nRecalled the error: Can't find metaxploit library in the /lib path or the current folder. I only saw /lib and metaxploit before. But \u0026ldquo;or the current folder\u0026rdquo;? Did that mean my local script directory? Would I need to download every libssh.so-like dependency just to run an exploit?\nChecked the black market, no libssh.so or similar. Recalled apt-get exists in-game (like real Linux). Ran apt-get search ssh. Bingo, libssh.so popped up. apt-get install libssh.so to install SSH.\nInstalled. Ran SSHPasswd 54.44.37.52 22. Still got Can't find metaxploit library in the /lib path or the current folder.\nSeriously, I\u0026rsquo;m out!!!\nBack to HackShop. Scrolled through Tools. metaxploit.so jumped out. Wait, isn\u0026rsquo;t that the \u0026ldquo;metaxploit\u0026rdquo; from the error? Pair that with \u0026ldquo;current folder\u0026rdquo; – was it missing this all along?\nDownloaded it to the script dir (/home/yexca/hacktool). Since scanrouter only saw Kernel_router.so, I ran KernelRouterAccess 54.44.37.52. Boom! Access granted!\nGaining Access Got access, first thought: delete logs. FileExplorer.exe to /var/system.log. Permission denied. Guest access, great. Tried /etc/passwd for password files. Still Permission denied. (Seriously, I probed almost every file).\nUgh, what\u0026rsquo;s the point of this script then?!\nSSH script changes passwords, too risky. Switched to the HTTP script to grab passwords. HttpPasswd 54.44.37.52 80. Got: can't read /etc/passwd. Permission denied. Saw I was still guest. I was like\u0026hellip;\nEnded up using the SSH script. SSHPasswd 54.44.37.52 22, new password 114514. Successfully changed Farraze\u0026rsquo;s password.\nRan ssh Farraze@114514 54.44.37.52, got into the victim\u0026rsquo;s machine. cat /etc/passwd pulled the encrypted root password info.\nLocally, touch mima.txt, pasted the root password info, then decipher mima.txt. Root password: 44444 (seriously?).\nexit to disconnect. ssh root@44444 54.44.37.52 got me in as root.\nInside the Machine First thing inside: delete logs. Users: Ralancl, Farraze. No Daronane. Still a forum user? Scoured the machine, found zip. (Transferred their cash to my account, btw~).\nMission brief mentioned 172.16.6.7.\nping 172.16.6.7. \u0026ldquo;Ping successful\u0026rdquo;. My own machine couldn\u0026rsquo;t ping it (obvious, it\u0026rsquo;s an internal network).\nnmap 172.16.6.7 for open ports. Got command not found.\nUgh, guess I\u0026rsquo;ll have to drop my command binaries into /bin on this machine.\nCopied. Ran nmap 172.16.6.7 again. Port 3306 open, service employees. What\u0026rsquo;s employees?\nSearch engine confirmed: 3306 is usually a DB port. SQL script time.\nPassword Acquired Hit HackShop, searched scripts. Found one: \u0026ldquo;Take advantage of a vulnerability in the sql service to inject a new password to a registered user.\u0026rdquo; Requirement: \u0026ldquo;Any user logged in the computer.\u0026rdquo; DB creation implies users logged in.\nDownloaded. SqlChangePasswd 172.16.6.7 3306. Error: Connection refused. Address unreachable. Access denied. Right, DBs are usually whitelisted.\nMoved script and metaxploit.so to victim\u0026rsquo;s /root. Retried the command, set password to 114514 for user Osquel.\nOkay, now what? Password changed, but only 3306 is open. Can\u0026rsquo;t get in! XD\nAlright, back to HackShop. Script search. Found one: \u0026ldquo;Prints the contents of the file /etc/passwd\u0026rdquo;. Requirement: \u0026ldquo;Any user logged in the computer.\u0026rdquo; Same as the last one.\nDropped the script into victim\u0026rsquo;s /root. SqlPrintPasswd 172.16.6.7 3306. Got all user passwords, Daronane included.\nCopied to my machine, decrypted: password pierra.\n??? Sent the password to the client. Confirmed???\nSeriously\u0026hellip;\nEpic! (From YouTuber Hei Biaoke)\nAfterword Got the password via email from the start. Then I spent ages getting it again. (Speechless, seriously).\nGot 200, but my scripts cost way more (net loss, lol). Still, scripts are reusable, and the exploration was pretty fun!\nGuides for this game are practically nonexistent. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for one, hope this helps!\n","date":"2022-08-03T22:41:06+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/54/","title":"Logging My First Grey Hack Mission (Password Acquisition)"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by Gemini-3-flash Written by Hiyoung Original Article: https://blog.hiyoung.icu/2022/08/03/0b5e2db181ab/ I\u0026rsquo;ve been using GitHub a lot lately to store code from my learning process.

It\u0026rsquo;s definitely better to write these things down for future reference.\nIn this article, the Wi-Fi that the OpenWRT router connects to is referred to as the \u0026ldquo;upstream router,\u0026rdquo; and the OpenWRT device itself is the \u0026ldquo;router.\u0026rdquo;\nPrerequisites Ensure the LAN IP address of your router (the one used to access the web UI) is different from the upstream router\u0026rsquo;s address. If they conflict, you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to access the internet.\nChanging the Router\u0026rsquo;s LAN Address Go to Network -\u0026gt; Interfaces, click Edit for the LAN interface, and change its IPv4 address.\nFor example, if the upstream router is at 192.168.1.1, you can change your router to 192.168.5.1.\nAfter clicking Save \u0026amp; Apply, use the new address in your browser to access the router\u0026rsquo;s backend.\nConnecting the Router to Wi-Fi Go to Network -\u0026gt; Wireless, click Scan, find the Wi-Fi you want to connect to, and click Join Network. Enter the network name and password, click Submit, and then click Save \u0026amp; Apply.\nSetting up the Router\u0026rsquo;s Wi-Fi Hotspot If your router is dual-band (2.4G and 5G), it\u0026rsquo;s best to create your hotspot on a different band than the one used for the relay for maximum compatibility. (If the other band already has a Wi-Fi network active, it might already be ready to use.)\nIf you only have a single band, you must create a new network on that same band. Note that this may not always work, as some hardware doesn\u0026rsquo;t support simultaneous receiving and transmitting on a single radio.\nSetting up the Wi-Fi follows the standard process: go to Network -\u0026gt; Wireless, add a network, enter the SSID (Wi-Fi name) and password, then Save \u0026amp; Apply.\nReferences OpenWrt Advanced Tutorial: Wireless Relay Configuration Guide - iyzm.net ","date":"2022-06-23T14:50:21+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/49/","title":"OpenWRT Wireless Relaying"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by Gemini-3-flash Introduction Since Tencent Cloud Functions started charging in June, I\u0026rsquo;ve moved my setup to my own server.\nWhy write this now? Well, my miHoYo BBS cookies expired and needed replacing, so I\u0026rsquo;m documenting the process for future reference.\nTools \u0026amp; Original Tutorial Genshin Impact Helper - Yindan\u0026rsquo;s Blog The original post covers many methods, which can be a bit cluttered. This post focuses on the specific method I use.\nTencent Cloud Function Cleanup Make sure to freeze your Tencent Cloud Functions to avoid any unexpected charges.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t need the service anymore, you can cancel your account, but be aware that account deletion requires a photo of you holding your ID.\nPrerequisites Your server must be able to reach miHoYo\u0026rsquo;s servers: https://mihoyo.com Run ping mihoyo.com in your SSH terminal to verify connectivity.\nOne of my servers couldn\u0026rsquo;t connect, so I had to switch to another one.\nDocker Installation Use the official one-click script. It\u0026rsquo;s verified to work on Debian 10 and CentOS 7 (use the root account).\nInstallation command:\n1 curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | bash -s docker --mirror Aliyun For users in Mainland China, you can use the DaoCloud mirror:\n1 curl -sSL https://get.daocloud.io/docker | sh Script Installation Pull the image with the following command:\n1 docker pull yindan/genshinhelper CentOS Error I encountered a Can't Connect to Docker Daemon error on CentOS.\nEnsure you are root, then run:\n1 systemctl start docker Basic Usage Getting the Cookie To get your miHoYo Cookie, refer to: Genshin Resin Tracker/Push – yexca\u0026rsquo;Blog Note: The Cookie must include the account_id and cookie_token fields.\nFor multiple accounts, separate Cookies with a #, for example: Cookie1#Cookie2#Cookie3.\nSimple Configuration 1 2 3 4 docker run -d --name=genshinhelper \\ -e COOKIE_MIHOYOBBS=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;COOKIE_MIHOYOBBS\u0026gt;\u0026#34; \\ --restart always \\ yindan/genshinhelper:latest Just replace \u0026lt;COOKIE_MIHOYOBBS\u0026gt; with your actual Cookie.\nReconfiguring/Updating Cookies To reconfigure, you usually need to remove and redeploy the container.\nAlternatively, if using a configuration file, you just need to swap the Cookie (though Cookies tend to last a long time).\nCommon Commands 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 # View all Docker containers docker ps -a # View logs docker logs -f genshinhelper --tail 100 # Restart docker restart genshinhelper # Update docker pull yindan/genshinhelper docker rm -f genshinhelper # Then redeploy using the basic or advanced method # Uninstall docker rm -f genshinhelper docker image rm yindan/genshinhelper Advanced Usage You can download the example file and modify it.\nGithub: config.json Telegram: https://t.me/genshinhelperupdates/5 Installation Assuming your config file is at /etc/genshin/config.json, use this command to map the volume:\n1 2 3 4 docker run -d --name=genshinhelper \\ -v /etc/genshin:/app/genshincheckinhelper/config \\ --restart always \\ yindan/genshinhelper:latest Configuration You can strip the config file down to only the parameters you need.

Yeah, this thing has quite a few bugs, and autostart doesn\u0026rsquo;t always trigger, but she\u0026rsquo;s just too adorable!\nThis extension also lets you change the background, but I\u0026rsquo;m not a big fan of that, so I skipped it.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s How It Looks Installation Open VS Code, then search for A-SOUL-live2d in Extensions and install it.\nExtension link: A-SOUL-live2d - Visual Studio Marketplace Honestly, you can just check the extension page for the installation process; no need to read my crappy article.\nBasic Usage Once installed, restart VS Code. Then, at the very bottom of the Explorer view, you\u0026rsquo;ll see LIVE2D-A-SOUL. Expand it (if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t expand, restart VS Code again).\nNext, in Supplementary Settings, click Generate plugin dependency files. Restart VS Code, then click Start live2d.\nJia Ran will pop up in the bottom right corner! You can hover your mouse over her, drag the third icon in the top right to move her position, and click the first icon to change her size.\nAfter adjusting her position and size, you can enable Autostart in Configuration Info, then click Save Current Configuration. Now, Jia Ran will appear every time you open VS Code~\nOther Features The following is copied from the plugin description:\nBasic Operations\nStart/Stop live2d: Self-explanatory. Starts the live2d character, defaulting to the bottom right. Save Current Configuration: After adjusting live2d size, scale, and drag position, you can save the settings. They\u0026rsquo;ll be loaded automatically next time. Reset Default Position: Use this if the current position is abnormal and cannot be dragged. [Scaling also resets] Background Image Click to Switch: The button is the second icon to the right of the character. Save Background Image: Only works if a background image is currently present. Only one can be saved; clicking again will overwrite the old one. Load Background Image: Loads the saved background image. Timed Switching: Self-explanatory. Check if the switch button is spinning to determine if the timed function is enabled. Background Image Style Configuration Download Background Image Configuration Info\nAutostart: Self-explanatory. When enabled, live2d will automatically start when VS Code launches. Positioning Dependency: The corner used for character positioning. Supplementary Settings\nPlugin Dependency Files: Plugin dependency files are automatically generated when the plugin is first installed and launched. Generate: If live2d fails to start normally, try clicking this button to force regeneration and overwrite existing configuration. Remove: Before uninstalling this plugin, please try to perform this operation first. It can remove all modifications the plugin made to VS Code files.

Please select [Don\u0026rsquo;t show again].\nAudio Support The current plugin only has a simple voice test; for now, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to consider this feature.\nVS Code\u0026rsquo;s Electron version does not include ffmpeg , so you need to replace the built-in ffmpeg dynamic link library for normal playback (you\u0026rsquo;ll need to replace it after every VS Code update).\nVS Code for Windows 1.31.0 - 1.35.1 didn\u0026rsquo;t require replacement; versions 1.36.0 and later don\u0026rsquo;t have this luxury.\nVS Code for macOS 1.43+ crashes after replacement Solution Uninstallation First, Remove from Supplementary Settings, then uninstall the plugin from the Extensions view.\n","date":"2022-06-01T06:01:00+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/45/","title":"Jia Ran in the Bottom Right Corner of VS Code"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by Gemini-3-flash Introduction I recently set up a personal page using GitHub Pages (it\u0026rsquo;s gone now), so here\u0026rsquo;s a quick guide on how to build a site and use a custom domain.\nThis post doesn\u0026rsquo;t cover complex site generators, since I basically just wrote a single Markdown file.\nCreate a GitHub Repository First, sign up for a GitHub account. Once logged in, create a new repository .\nThe Repository name should be username.github.io. For example, if my GitHub username is yexca, I would enter yexca.github.io.\nGit Environment Setup On Windows, just download and run the installer from the official Git website.\nAfter installation, open Git Bash and run the following commands:\n1 2 git config --global user.name \u0026#34;Your Name\u0026#34; git config --global user.email \u0026#34;email@example.com\u0026#34; Replace Your Name with your name and email@example.com with your email.\nFor example:\n1 2 git config --global user.name \u0026#34;yexca\u0026#34; git config --global user.email \u0026#34;yexca@duck.com\u0026#34; GitHub Desktop Installation If you\u0026rsquo;re already familiar with Git (though if you were, why are you reading this?), you can skip this step.\nGo to the GitHub Desktop website to download and install it.\nClone the Repository Open GitHub Desktop, log in, and clone the repository you just created to a local folder.\nThe app will show the repository interface with some quick actions on the right.\nI use VS Code, so I\u0026rsquo;ll click \u0026ldquo;Open in Visual Studio Code\u0026rdquo;.\nBuild the Site Create a README.md file and edit it using Markdown (shameless plug for my own Markdown notes).\nOnce edited and saved, go back to GitHub Desktop, click \u0026ldquo;Commit to main\u0026rdquo;, then click \u0026ldquo;Push origin\u0026rdquo;.\nNow, visit username.github.io to see your site. (If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t show up immediately, give it a few minutes).\nCustom Domain GitHub Pages Go to your repository settings, find \u0026ldquo;Pages\u0026rdquo; on the left, enter your custom domain under \u0026ldquo;Custom domain\u0026rdquo;, and click \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo;.\nNote: You can also choose a Jekyll theme here.\nDNS In your domain\u0026rsquo;s DNS settings, add a CNAME record pointing your domain to username.github.io, where username is your GitHub username.\nHTTPS For some reason, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get HTTPS working directly through GitHub, so I used Cloudflare .\nEnable the proxy in DNS settings, then under \u0026ldquo;SSL/TLS\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Edge Certificates\u0026rdquo;, toggle on \u0026ldquo;Always Use HTTPS\u0026rdquo;.\nOther Site Builders Since I didn\u0026rsquo;t need a full blog, I just used a simple file. If you want a real blog, check out these tools:\nJekyll : Officially supported by GitHub. VuePress : Great for Markdown-centric sites. Gitbook: Good for documentation sites.

This thing is super useful, so I\u0026rsquo;m writing up some learning notes.\nYou can learn on the go with an online editor , or download a desktop editor .\nMy preferred Markdown editor is Typora .\nFor a quick refresh, check out the official Markdown Syntax Cheat Sheet .\nHeadings To create a heading, just use # + space + heading text. There are six levels, mapping to HTML\u0026rsquo;s h1-h6.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 # This is a H1 ## This is a H2 ### This is a H3 #### This is a H4 ##### This is a H5 ###### This is a H6 For general web writing, the H1 is usually the page title, H2s start the main content, and you\u0026rsquo;ll probably use up to H4.\nLine Breaks Just add two or more spaces at the end of a line, then hit Enter. Some editors might add a line break directly.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 这是第一行 //这里有俩空格，后面也有→ 这是第二行 Result:\nThis is the first line // two spaces here, and more after →\nThis is the second line\nItalics \u0026amp; Bold For italics, wrap text with a single *. For bold, use two **.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 3 *This is italics* **This is bold** ***This is italic and bold*** Result:\nThis is italics\nThis is bold\nThis is italic and bold\nBlockquotes To create a blockquote, just add \u0026gt; + space + content at the start of a paragraph.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 3 \u0026gt; This is a level 1 blockquote \u0026gt;\u0026gt; This is a level 2 blockquote \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; This is a level 3 blockquote Result:\nThis is a level 1 blockquote\nThis is a level 2 blockquote\nThis is a level 3 blockquote\nLists You can create ordered and unordered lists.\nOrdered Lists Just add number + . + space + content before each list item.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 3 1. First item 2. Second item 3. Third item Result:\nFirst item Second item Third item Unordered Lists Use +, -, or * + space + content. But don\u0026rsquo;t mix them (for compatibility).\nSub-items can be indented with four spaces or a TAB, then formatted like the parent item.\nHowever, to comply with markdownlint standards, try to use the same symbol for all unordered lists in an article, like always using -.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 - First item - First item sub-item one - First item sub-item two - First item sub-item two sub-item one - Second item - Third item Result:\nFirst item First item sub-item one First item sub-item two First item sub-item two sub-item one Second item Third item Code Inline Code Wrap content you want to turn into inline code with backticks ( ). If your code contains a backtick, use double backticks ( ).\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 `Turn this content into a code block` ``This content contains a \u0026#39;`\u0026#39; oh~`` Result:\nTurn this content into a code block\nThis content contains a '`' oh~\nCode Blocks You can indent each line with four spaces or a TAB.\nAlternatively, wrap the code with triple backticks (```) on the lines above and below. For syntax highlighting, specify the language after the opening triple backticks.\nTo follow best practices, use the triple backtick method.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` C include\u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; int main(void) { printf(\u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34;); } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Result: ``` C include\u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; int main(void) { printf(\u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34;); } Horizontal Rules On a separate line, use three or more *, -, or _.\nFor consistency, it\u0026rsquo;s best to use three asterisks.\nFor example, this code:\n1 *** Result:\nLinks Simple Links Just wrap the URL or email address with \u0026lt;\u0026gt;.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 \u0026lt;https://yexca.net\u0026gt; \u0026lt;yexca@duck.com\u0026gt; Result:\nhttps://yexca.net yexca@duck.com Links with Custom Text [Link text](URL \u0026quot;Optional Title\u0026quot;). The \u0026quot;Optional Title\u0026quot; part can be omitted.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 [yexca\u0026#39;s Blog](https://blog.yexca.net) [yexca\u0026#39;s Blog](https://blog.yexca.net \u0026#34;Actually, it\u0026#39;s yexca and Hiyoung\u0026#39;s blog\u0026#34;) Result:\nyexca\u0026rsquo;s Blog yexca\u0026rsquo;s Blog Reference-Style Links For example, this code:\n1 2 3 4 [blog]: https://blog.yexca.net [contact]: \u0026lt;mailto:yexca@duck.com\u0026gt; This is my [personal blog][blog]. If you have questions, you can [contact me][contact]. Result:\nThis is my personal blog . If you have questions, you can contact me .\nImages Embedding Images ![Alt text](Image URL \u0026quot;Optional Title\u0026quot;). Alt text shows if the image fails to load, and Optional Title appears on hover.\nNote: Some Markdown editors don\u0026rsquo;t support Optional Title (like this site\u0026rsquo;s theme). For best practice, at least ensure Alt text is provided.\nFor example, this code:\n1 ![Image](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/yexca/picx-images-hosting@master/2023/04-网站背景/blog-background.2p10z489pjc0.webp \u0026#34;This is the background of this site\u0026#34;) Result:\nImage with a Link Use the link syntax, but put the image syntax inside the [].\nFor example, this code:\n1 [![Image](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/yexca/picx-images-hosting@master/2023/04-网站背景/blog-background.2p10z489pjc0.webp)](https://www.pixiv.net/artworks/82542737) Result:\nEscaping Characters If you have characters you don\u0026rsquo;t want Markdown to format, just add a \\ before them.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 I want to type *but this will be italic* Adding an escape character \\* will prevent italics and display the character Result:\nI want to type but this will be italic\nAdding an escape character * will prevent italics and display the character\nEmbedded HTML You can use HTML directly. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example with the \u0026lt;details\u0026gt; tag.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \u0026lt;details\u0026gt; \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; Click me \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; Found you! \u0026lt;/details\u0026gt; I can use Markdown **for bold**, and also HTML \u0026lt;i\u0026gt;for italics\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt; at the same time. Since this site\u0026rsquo;s theme doesn\u0026rsquo;t directly parse HTML5, I won\u0026rsquo;t demonstrate it live.\nTables Use three or more - for column headers, | to separate columns, and : for left, right, or center alignment (optional).\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 3 |Title|Content|Notes| |:---|:---:|---:| |Left-aligned|Centered|Right-aligned| Result:\nTitle Content Notes Left-aligned Centered Right-aligned Note: You cannot add headings, blockquotes, lists, images, or HTML tags inside tables.\nStrikethrough Add ~~ before and after the text you want to strike through.\nFor example, this code:\n1 I will always love ~~Dr. War Literature~~ Warma Result:\nI will always love Dr. War Literature Warma\nTask Lists Use - + space + [ ] or [x] + space + content.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 - [ ] This isn\u0026#39;t done yet - [x] This one is finished Result:\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t done yet This one is finished Using Emojis Copy and Paste In most cases, you can directly copy emojis from Emojipedia and paste them. Just ensure your web encoding is UTF-8.\nUsing Emoji Shortcodes This requires Markdown application support, using colons : at the beginning and end.\nYou can look up shortcodes via the Emoji Shortcode List .\nFor example, this code:\n1 :blush:,:smiley: Result:\n😊,😃\nFootnotes Similar to citations or superscripts in academic papers.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 This references Wikipedia[^1], and this references Github[^2]. You can also use English, but no spaces or TABs[^yexca]. [^1]: You can use text here, which will appear at the corresponding position above.

I found a tutorial by WGzeyu in the Steam reviews. Since my goal is simple, and their tutorial is quite comprehensive, I\u0026rsquo;m writing this article to summarize it.\n1. Preparation Note: Update 2022.03.25: I checked today and mods for 1.20.0 are available. See step two directly. The data restoration section has also been updated.\n1) Downgrading The current latest version, 1.20.0, doesn\u0026rsquo;t have mods yet. So, you need to downgrade. You can upgrade again after mods are updated.\n\u0026lt;1\u0026gt; Download version 1.19.0 or earlier You can download from this cloud drive provided by WGzeyu . Choose the version you want and download it.\nDirect link: 1.19.0 steam version \u0026lt;2\u0026gt; Replace the 1.20.0 version Extract the downloaded file. Then, open the game\u0026rsquo;s directory via Steam. Go up one level, rename the \u0026ldquo;Beat Saber\u0026rdquo; folder to \u0026ldquo;Beat Saber 1.20.0\u0026rdquo;. Then, rename the downloaded file to \u0026ldquo;Beat Saber\u0026rdquo; and move it into this folder.\n\u0026lt;3\u0026gt; How to restore data \u0026lt;1\u0026gt; Use Steam to open the game directory. Delete \u0026ldquo;Beat Saber IPA\u0026rdquo; from the UserData folder. \u0026lt;2\u0026gt; Copy the following folders (copy as needed):\nUserData (Mod settings) CustomSabers (Lightsaber models) CustomPlatforms (Stage models) CustomAvatars (Avatar models) CustomNotes (Block models) \u0026lt;3\u0026gt; Navigate to the \u0026ldquo;Beat Saber 1.20.0\u0026rdquo; folder.

Official website: ResilioSync Direct link: ResilioSync 64-bit 3) Folders The software mentioned above, except for ResilioSync, are single-file applications. You can place them in a folder for common software.\nYou also need to create a folder where you want to store your songs, e.g., \u0026ldquo;E:\\games\\Beat Saber Song\\\u0026rdquo;. Any location is fine.\n2. Steps 1) Launch Beat Saber once 2) Open \u0026ldquo;ModAssistant\u0026rdquo; Click \u0026ldquo;Agree\u0026rdquo; to access the \u0026ldquo;Mod\u0026rdquo; interface on the left.

Since Koikatu is my favorite, I decided to give it a try. However, I encountered several issues, so I’m documenting them here. Note: the VR version has no story mode, and I used the vanilla version of the game, so there were fewer problems overall.\nPrerequisites / Conditions Some of the following images and text are from the official Oculus Support page . I translated some parts myself, but since my English isn\u0026rsquo;t great, please refer to the official content for accuracy. For full details, see Oculus Link compatibility requirements .\nCable Requirements Oculus Link requires a high-quality USB cable that supports both data and power. For comfort and usability, the cable should be at least 3 meters (10 feet) long.\nPC Requirements Component Recommended Specs CPU Intel i5-4590 / AMD Ryzen 5 1500X or better GPU See table below RAM 8 GB or more OS Windows 10 USB Port At least one USB port Supported GPUs for Oculus Link NVIDIA GPUs Supported Not Supported NVIDIA Titan Z X NVIDIA Titan X X NVIDIA GTX 970 X GTX 1060 (Desktop, 3GB) X GTX 1060 (Desktop, 6GB) X GTX 1060M X GTX 1070 (all) X GTX 1080 (all) X GTX 1650 X GTX 1650 Super X GTX 1660 X GTX 1660 Ti X RTX 20-series (all) X RTX 30-series (all) X AMD GPUs Supported Not Supported AMD 200 Series X AMD 300 Series X AMD 400 Series X AMD 500 Series X AMD 5000 Series X AMD 6000 Series X AMD Vega Series X 1. Launching the Game To launch the VR version, simply open KoikatuVR.exe. Since this uses Steam streaming, you should start SteamVR beforehand.\nBefore playing, make sure to wear your headphones and lock your door to avoid\u0026hellip; unexpected situations. If you can’t, then just play responsibly (doge).\nProblem 1: Can’t Enter SteamVR Step 1: Ensure All Required Software Is Installed 1) Install SteamVR Open Steam, press Win+R, enter steam://run/250820, and hit enter. This will trigger the installation of SteamVR.\n2) Install Oculus Software Go to the Oculus setup page . After installation, additional files will be downloaded, and you’ll be prompted to log in. Make sure your network is working properly.\nIf asked for a payment method, look for a “Skip” button.\nStuck on Loading at Login? You can fix this by modifying your hosts file. I recommend using Huorong (a Chinese antivirus tool) to edit it safely.\nIf you don’t use Huorong, go to C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc, find the file named hosts, and open it with Notepad.\nAdd the following lines at the end:\n1 2 3 4 5 157.240.11.49 graph.oculus.com 157.240.11.49 www2.oculus.com 157.240.8.49 scontent.oculuscdn.com 157.240.8.49 securecdn.oculus.com Save the file. If you\u0026rsquo;re not using Huorong, save it elsewhere first and move it back, removing any .txt extension.\nStep 2: Check the Link Cable The Oculus app will prompt you to test the Link cable during setup. If you skipped it, go to Devices \u0026gt; Quest2 and Touch - USB Test to test again.\nStep 3: Check Settings 1) Quest2 Device Settings When you connect your Quest2 via USB, it will ask if you want to allow data access. Select “Deny.” If you allowed it by mistake, unplug and reconnect, then choose “Deny.”\n2) Oculus Software Settings SteamVR will prompt you to allow “unknown sources.” Click “Allow.”\nAlternatively, go to Settings \u0026gt; General \u0026gt; Unknown Sources in the Oculus software.\nStep 4: Still Not Working? Try This Sequence 1) Quest2 Device After connecting to your PC, you should see a popup asking to “Enable Oculus Link.” Click “Enable.”\nIf no popup appears, go to the Quick Settings panel on the bottom left and click “Oculus Link.”\n2) Start SteamVR Surely you know how to launch SteamVR\u0026hellip; right? (doge)\nIf your VR device is connected before starting Steam, the top-right corner of Steam should show a “VR” button. Click it to start.\nIf not, right-click the Steam icon in your system tray and select the second-last option — that’s SteamVR.\nOr enable the \u0026ldquo;Tools\u0026rdquo; view in your Steam library to find SteamVR listed there.\n2. Starting the Game I don’t really know what to write here — this section exists just to make Problem 2 game-related (doge).\nLaunching KoikatuVR.exe will auto-start SteamVR. So you can open KoikatuVR after launching Oculus Link on your Quest2.\nNote: The game also opens a window on your desktop. You can press Win+D to minimize all windows. But when you take off and put your headset back on, the window may reappear. Just a heads-up.\nProblem 2: Can’t Start the Game / Don’t Know How You might’ve read elsewhere or seen videos saying only certain devices are supported (I forgot which).\nIf you also tested “VR Kanojo” and assumed it uses eye tracking to select — that’s incorrect (I thought so too lol).\nJust press the joystick to bring up a selection line, then use the front trigger to confirm.\n(See 3. Controls for more input info.)\nProblem 3: White Screen After Starting / Stuck on Loading Go to the Koikatu DL page and scroll down to download the コイカツ VR パッチ.\nDirect link: VR Patch Download Unzip the file and run the executable. It’ll create a コイカツ！VR_0531 folder. Copy the contents of the setup folder into your game directory and overwrite when prompted.\nNote: According to the original author, this patch may limit positions to only three. I didn’t verify it myself since I didn’t play far. I initially wanted to play the story in VR, but that’s not supported. Here’s their (edited) fix:\nYou need to use the positions in Story Mode first, then they become available in VR. So just go through all positions during battles, then save at night, exit, switch to VR, and they’ll be available.\nSource (Chinese): Anyone Tried the VR Version? 3. Controls These are based on personal gameplay and only cover the basics. For full controls, consult other guides.\n1) Starting the Game You’ll see two options after launch:\nスタート = Start エンド = End Press the joystick to show a selection line, and confirm with the front trigger.\n2) In-Game Interface Text will appear near your wrist. Use the Y and B buttons to switch tabs.\nThere are two tabs normally and a third (Move) during combat:\nJapanese English Description Function アクション Action Actions Front trigger to act, side trigger for menu, joystick to select システム System System Settings Front trigger to reset position 移動 Move Movement Hold front trigger to rotate view 3) Notes You can only use the joystick to select options while on the “アクション” (Action) tab.\nReferences Oculus Link Official Anyone Tried the VR Version?

The networks we typically use (including the internet) operate based on the TCP/IP suite, and HTTP is a subset of it. For devices on the internet to communicate, they must follow common rules, which we call protocols. (TCP/IP is a general term for various internet-related protocol families, including but not limited to: PPPoE, HTTP, TCP, IP, UDP, IEEE 802.3, etc.)\nThe TCP/IP protocol suite is structured in layers, from top to bottom: Application Layer, Transport Layer, Network Layer, Data Link Layer.\nInternet protocol suite - Wikipedia When communicating using the TCP/IP protocol suite, the client moves down from the Application Layer, and the server moves up from the Data Link Layer. As the client transmits data between layers, each layer adds its header information. Conversely, the server removes headers layer by layer. This method of wrapping data is called encapsulation.\n1.2 IP, TCP, and DNS 1.2.1 IP Protocol The IP protocol operates at the Network Layer. The \u0026ldquo;IP\u0026rdquo; in TCP/IP refers to the IP protocol itself, not an IP address. The IP protocol\u0026rsquo;s job is to send various data packets to their destination. Different IP addresses can be paired with MAC addresses. While IP addresses can change, MAC addresses generally do not. An IP address specifies the address assigned to a node, while a MAC address is the fixed address belonging to a network interface card (NIC).\n1.2.2 MAC Address Communication between IPs relies on MAC addresses. Typically, the ARP protocol is used to find the corresponding MAC address for a given IP address.\n1.2.3 TCP Protocol Layer-wise, TCP is in the Transport Layer, providing a Byte Stream Service. This means it manages large chunks of data by splitting them into smaller segments for easier transmission. In short, TCP segments data to make large transfers simpler and can also confirm if data successfully reached the other party.\nTo confirm data delivery, TCP uses a three-way handshake. This handshake uses TCP flags: SYN (synchronize) and ACK (acknowledgement).\n1.2.4 DNS Service for Domain Name Resolution Computers can be assigned both IP addresses and hostnames/domain names. The DNS protocol provides services to look up IP addresses from domain names, or vice-versa, to find domain names from IP addresses.\n1.3 URL and URI 1.3.1 Differences and Relationship Compared to URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), we\u0026rsquo;re more familiar with URL (Uniform Resource Locator). URLs are what you type into a web browser to access web pages, like https://www.bilibili.com/ . A URI identifies a resource on the internet using a string, while a URL indicates the resource\u0026rsquo;s location (its address on the internet). So, a URL is a subset of a URI. A URI can be a locator (URL), a name (URN), or both. A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is like a person\u0026rsquo;s name, while a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is like their address. In other words, a URN defines what something is, and a URL provides how to find it.\n1.3.2 URI Format To represent a specific URI, you can use an absolute URI, absolute URL, or relative URL, all of which contain the necessary information.\nA relative URL is specified from the browser\u0026rsquo;s base URI, for example, /image/logo.gif.\nAbsolute URI format:\nLogin Info (Authentication): Specifies a username and password for authentication when retrieving resources from the server. This is optional.\nServer Address: When using an absolute URI, you must specify the server address to access. This can be a DNS-resolvable name like hackr.jp, an IPv4 address like 192.168.1.1, or an IPv6 address enclosed in square brackets, such as [0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1].\nServer Port Number: Specifies the network port number for connecting to the server. This is also optional; if omitted, the default port is used automatically.\nHierarchical File Path: Specifies the file path on the server to locate the specific resource. This is similar to the directory structure in UNIX systems.\nQuery String: For resources within the specified file path, you can pass arbitrary parameters using a query string. This is optional.\nFragment Identifier: A fragment identifier typically marks a sub-resource within the retrieved resource (a specific location within a document). However, its usage is not explicitly defined in RFCs . This is also optional.\nChapter 2: The Simple HTTP Protocol 2.1 HTTP Introduction HTTP is a stateless protocol. This means the HTTP protocol itself doesn\u0026rsquo;t save the communication state between each request and response. So, cookie technology was introduced to maintain state. (Note: This HTTP book was published earlier. Current state management technologies are achieved through a combination of cookies, sessions, and tokens .)\n2.2 Common HTTP Methods GET: Retrieve resources\nThe GET method is used to request the resource specified by the URL. The server processes the specified resource and returns the response content.\nPOST: Transmit entity body\nPOST is used to send data to the server. It\u0026rsquo;s also employed when the data to be transmitted (e.g., in a request body) is too large.\nDifferences between GET and POST:\nLet\u0026rsquo;s cut to the chase: there\u0026rsquo;s no fundamental difference between GET and POST methods; it\u0026rsquo;s mostly about message format.\nRequest Parameter Length Limit: GET requests are typically limited to ~1024KB (browser/server dependent), while POST has no inherent limit on request data. Request Parameters: GET request parameters are passed via the URL, with multiple parameters joined by \u0026lsquo;\u0026amp;\u0026rsquo;. POST request parameters are placed in the request body. Request Caching: GET requests can be cached, while POST requests are not, unless manually configured. Security: POST is considered more secure than GET. GET requests are harmless on browser back, but POST may re-submit the request. History: GET request parameters are fully retained in browser history, while POST parameters are not. Encoding: GET requests only support URL encoding, while POST supports various encoding types. Parameter Data Types: GET typically only accepts ASCII characters (after URL encoding), while POST has no such restriction.\nAdditionally, HTTP includes other methods like PUT, HEAD, and DELETE , which we won\u0026rsquo;t detail here.\n2.3 HTTP Persistent Connections (Three-way Handshake, Four-way Wave) The characteristic of persistent connections is that the TCP connection remains active as long as neither end explicitly requests to close it.\nThree-way handshake: Establishes TCP connection. Four-way wave: Terminates TCP connection.\nWith persistent connections, pipelining allows sending the next request without waiting for the previous response.\n2.4 State Management with Cookies Cookies instruct the client to save a Cookie based on the \u0026lsquo;Set-Cookie\u0026rsquo; header field information sent in the server\u0026rsquo;s response. The next time the client sends a request to that server, it automatically includes the Cookie value in the request message.\nCookie information is generated by the server and sent to the client for storage.\nChapter 3: HTTP Message Information 3.1 HTTP Request and Response Message Structure Information exchanged using the HTTP protocol is called an HTTP message. HTTP messages from the requesting party (client) are called request messages, and those from the responding party (server) are called response messages. They consist of an 8-bit byte stream and are transmitted via HTTP communication.\nRequest Line: Contains the request method, request URI, and HTTP version.\nStatus Line: Contains the status code indicating the response result, a reason phrase, and the HTTP version.\nHeader Fields: Contain various headers representing conditions and attributes of the request and response. Generally, there are four types of headers: General Headers, Request Headers, Response Headers, and Entity Headers.\nOther: May include headers not defined in HTTP RFCs (e.g., Cookie).\n3.2 Encoded and Chunked Transfer HTTP uses encoding during data transmission to improve transfer speed.\n3.2.1 Differences Between Message Body and Entity Body Entity: Transmitted as payload data (supplementary item) in a request or response, its content consists of an entity header and an entity body.\nThe HTTP message body is used to transmit the request or response entity body. Typically, the message body equals the entity body. A difference between them only arises when encoding operations modify the entity body\u0026rsquo;s content during transmission.\n3.2.2 Chunking Entity Bodies for Transfer When transferring large amounts of data in HTTP communication, splitting the data into multiple chunks allows browsers to display pages progressively. This feature of chunking the entity body is called chunked transfer encoding. Chunked transfer encoding divides the entity body into multiple chunks. Each chunk is marked with its size in hexadecimal, and the last chunk of the entity body is marked with \u0026ldquo;0(CR+LF)\u0026rdquo;.\nThese \u0026ldquo;chunks\u0026rdquo; are also commonly referred to as \u0026ldquo;packets\u0026rdquo;.\nChapter 4: HTTP Status Codes for Return Results 4.1 Status Code Categories Status codes let users know if the server processed the request successfully. There are many types, but only about 14 are commonly used.\n4.2 2XX Success 4.2.1 200 OK Indicates that the client\u0026rsquo;s request was successfully processed by the server. The information returned with the status code in the response message varies depending on the method used.\n4.2.2 204 No Content This status code means the server successfully processed the request, but the returned response message contains no entity body.\n4.3 3XX Redirection We\u0026rsquo;ll focus on 301 and 302 redirects. Other status codes can be looked up independently.\n4.3.1 301 Moved Permanently A 301 redirect is a permanent redirection. This status code indicates that the requested resource has been assigned a new URI, and future requests should use the URI now pointing to that resource. For example, if you forget to add a trailing slash \u0026ldquo;/\u0026rdquo; to a resource path like the one below, a 301 status code might be generated.\nhttp://excample.com/sample\n4.3.2 302 Found A 302 redirect is a temporary redirection. This status code indicates that the requested resource has been assigned a new URI, and the client (for this time) is expected to access it using the new URI. Similar to 301 Moved Permanently, but 302 signifies a temporary move, not a permanent one.\n4.4 4XX Client Errors These include 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, and 404 Not Found. We\u0026rsquo;ll focus on 404 Not Found.\n4.4.1 404 Not Found This status code indicates that the requested resource could not be found on the server. It can also be used by the server to deny a request without specifying a reason.\n4.5 5XX Server Errors 5XX responses indicate an error occurred on the server itself.\nChapter 5: Web Servers 5.1 Communication Data Forwarding: Proxies, Gateways, Tunnels 5.1.1 Proxy A proxy server\u0026rsquo;s basic function is to receive a client\u0026rsquo;s request and forward it to another server. Proxies don\u0026rsquo;t alter the request URI; they send it directly to the upstream target server holding the resource. It\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that \u0026ldquo;proxy\u0026rdquo; usually refers to a client-side proxy (also called a forward proxy), while a reverse proxy acts on behalf of the server.\nUsing a proxy server can reduce network bandwidth by leveraging caching, and sometimes proxies are used for information security.\nCaching Proxy When forwarding responses, a Caching Proxy saves a copy (cache) of the resource on the proxy server beforehand. When the proxy receives another request for the same resource, it can return the cached resource as a response instead of fetching it from the origin server.\nReverse Proxy Reverse proxies offer many benefits:\nHides the IP address of the server (cluster) from clients. Security: Acts as an application layer firewall , providing protection against web-based attacks (e.g., DoS / DDoS ) and making it easier to identify malware , etc. Uniformly provides encryption and SSL acceleration for backend servers (clusters) (e.g., SSL termination proxy). Load balancing : If a server in the cluster is heavily loaded, the reverse proxy uses URL rewriting to retrieve the requested resource from a less-loaded server or a backup. Provides caching services for static content and dynamic content with high access requests in a short period. Performs compression on some content to save bandwidth or provide service to networks with poor bandwidth.\n5.1.2 Gateway Gateways operate very similarly to proxies. However, a gateway enables servers on the communication path to provide services using non-HTTP protocols.\n","date":"2022-03-16T23:56:48+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/29/","title":"Summary and Discussion After Reading 'Illustrated HTTP'"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by Gemini-3-flash Note This article is mirrored from 《unity学习笔记》——将MMD模型导入unity for personal reference.
