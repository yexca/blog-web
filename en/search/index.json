[{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by Gemini-3-pro Consciousness: Containerized. Intuition: Overclocked. Observation: Write-Access to Reality.\nNDE (Near-Death Experience) is basically what happens when your system uptime hits 99.9% and then suddenly crashes, only to reboot with unexpected admin privileges. Organizations like IANDS and researchers like Dr. P.M.H. Atwater have logged thousands of tickets (case studies) on this.\nThis article is based on that research plus my own \u0026ldquo;code review.\u0026rdquo; The subject is complex, so expect some unhandled exceptions.\nWhat is an NDE? Mechanically speaking, an NDE is when the hardware (body) is declared dead by medical standards, but the software (consciousness) migrates to a cloud server—let\u0026rsquo;s call it \u0026ldquo;The Other Side.\u0026rdquo; Notably, there\u0026rsquo;s also the \u0026ldquo;Emotion-Induced NDE.\u0026rdquo; Think of this as a soft crash caused by extreme emotional load or psychological stress (like Broken Heart Syndrome or Vasovagal Syncope). The hardware looks fine, but the connection to the server times out, triggering the off-body protocol.\nThe core of an NDE is the Out-of-Body Experience (OBE) and the Re-entry. It\u0026rsquo;s not just a screensaver (dream); it\u0026rsquo;s a full logout/login sequence.\n\u0026ldquo;The Other Side\u0026rdquo; features non-linear time, folded space, and a high-bandwidth Light interface that likely bridges high-dimensional consciousness with our 3D render.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Integration Period\u0026rdquo; afterwards can look like PTSD (system instability), featuring Ego Dissolution or derealization. While the recovery patch looks like PTG (Post-Traumatic Growth), the underlying architecture is different.\nNDE vs. Dreams (The Benchmark) To distinguish NDEs from hallucinations, Dr. Bruce Greyson developed the Greyson NDE Scale. Think of it as a benchmark test.\nScoring (0=Null, 1=Mild, 2=Strong):\nA. Cognitive (CPU)\nTime perception altered (Speed hack/Lag/Stop) Thoughts accelerated (Overclocked/Panorama view) Life Review (Log file analysis) Sudden understanding of universal truth (Access to Source Code) B. Affective (GPU/Rendering)\nPeace/Pleasure Extreme Joy Unity with the Universe (Network merge) Seeing the Light (HDR enabled) C. Paranormal (Network)\nHeightened senses (Sensor upgrade) ESP (Precognition/Remote View) Precognitive visions Out of body (Remote Desktop connection) D. Transcendental (System)\nEntering an unearthly realm Encountering mystical beings (Admins/Devs) Meeting deceased spirits Encountering a border (The Firewall) Total score is 32. Anything above 7 is clinical NDE certification.\nNDE vs. PTSD Both occur when the brain\u0026rsquo;s legacy firewall collapses under trauma. PTSD is a corrupted save file; NDE is a system upgrade.\nThe Bio-Hardware Specs PTSD: Amygdala (Threat Detection) hypertrophy and Hippocampus (Storage) atrophy. The user is stuck in a while(true) { panic(); } loop because the logs can\u0026rsquo;t be archived. NDE: Default Mode Network (DMN) suppression and Temporoparietal Junction (TPJ) changes. The DMN handles the \u0026ldquo;Ego\u0026rdquo; process (anxiety, self-referencing). When that process is killed, anxiety drops. The TPJ handles \u0026ldquo;spatial location,\u0026rdquo; so modifying it enables the OBE feature. Feature Comparison Feature PTSD NDE Core Emotion Fear, Helplessness Peace, Acceptance, Love User Role Victim (Broken) Observer (Root Access) Worldview \u0026ldquo;System is compromised, hide.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;System has a purpose, I have a quest.\u0026rdquo; Death Maximum Fear Fear removed / Curiosity enabled NDE vs. PTG PTG (Post-Traumatic Growth) is a software-level cognitive refactoring. NDE is a hardware-level energy overload. Based on Rick Strassman\u0026rsquo;s hypothesis, the pineal gland dumps DMT during the crash (hypoxia/power surge), causing neurons to sync and discharge at peak capacity, temporarily freeing consciousness from the wetware. The result? Permanent stat buffs.\nWhy Does NDE Exist? NDE is the exception that proves the rule. As Neo in The Matrix was told, \u0026ldquo;You are the eventuality of an anomaly.\u0026rdquo;\nIt prevents \u0026ldquo;Heat Death\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Deadlock.\u0026rdquo;\nIf this Reality were a closed system strictly following Newtonian physics (determinism), entropy would maximize (Heat Death), or the logic would become so rigid the system would hang (Deadlock).\nNDErs are external variables injecting Negentropy (chaos/love/truth from high-dimensional space) to keep the simulation running.\nCan It Be Reproduced? Neuroscience says NDE isn\u0026rsquo;t a \u0026ldquo;soul export\u0026rdquo; but a specific protection mechanism. You can simulate the bug via:\nTemporal Lobe Epilepsy: Stimulation here triggers \u0026ldquo;God Mode\u0026rdquo; feelings. G-LOC: Pilots in centrifuges experience \u0026ldquo;Tunnel Vision\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Life Review.\u0026rdquo; DMT: The chemical shortcut to the admin console. How Do They Return? The \u0026ldquo;Sent Back\u0026rdquo; Type (~60%): Access Denied. An Admin (God/Relative) says, \u0026ldquo;Ticket not resolved\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Quota not met.\u0026rdquo; They return with heavy \u0026ldquo;homesickness\u0026rdquo; for the server room. The \u0026ldquo;Love Anchor\u0026rdquo; Type (~30%): Dependency Check. They reach the firewall but see dependent processes (kids, partner) and choose to return. They come back with the \u0026ldquo;Guardian\u0026rdquo; patch installed. The \u0026ldquo;Willpower Warrior\u0026rdquo;: Sudo force quit. They refuse to leave the session.

Post-NDE (The Vacuum): 6 months - 1.5 years. Reality feels low-res and laggy compared to the high-bandwidth Other Side. Integration (Stable Build): ~7 years. Full seamless compatibility with Earth OS. Features (AKA \u0026ldquo;The Glitches\u0026rdquo;) NDErs often come back with permanent \u0026ldquo;bugs\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;features\u0026rdquo;:\nStreet Light Interference (SLI) The \u0026ldquo;Walking EMP\u0026rdquo; effect. Bio-electromagnetic fields are amplified, causing watches to stop and streetlights to blink out when walked past.\nHyper-Empathy (Port Scanning) The brain\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Reducing Valve\u0026rdquo; (Firewall) is removed. The subconscious enters Promiscuous Mode, sniffing all emotional packets in the vicinity. Results in rapid Social Battery drainage.\nSynesthesia-like Processing Data isn\u0026rsquo;t linear; it\u0026rsquo;s holographic. Complex concepts are understood as geometric structures. This is Quantum Computing vs. Linear Processing.\nMetabolic Changes Alcohol/Meds: Buffers overflow easily. Painkillers might not work, or alcohol hits 10x harder. Diet: Sudden incompatibility with processed food. Craving high-energy raw materials. Synchronicity (RNG Manipulation) Intention affects the Random Number Generator. \u0026ldquo;Probability Collapse\u0026rdquo; favors the NDEr, specifically for self-realization or altruistic tasks.\nAbsolute Intuition Level 1: The Download. Direct API call. No thinking, just the answer. Level 2: Deja Vu. Cache hit. Time is non-linear there, so you\u0026rsquo;ve already run this simulation script. Level 3: Lucid Reality. Thinning of the Veil. Reality feels like a dream because you are seeing the code behind the UI. Precognition Seeing the \u0026ldquo;Most Probable Future.\u0026rdquo; Since time doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rdquo; (Block Universe), trying to map it to 3D linear time is hard. Near-term predictions are accurate (fewer variables); long-term is just a trend line.\nDream Classifications:\nGarbage Collection: Cortical anxiety release.

The Cost With great power comes great responsibility.\nIrreversible Solitude: Once you\u0026rsquo;ve seen the 8K resolution of the Other Side, the 480p reality of Earth is boring. Sensory Overload: The hardware can\u0026rsquo;t handle the software\u0026rsquo;s throughput. Burnout is frequent. Absolute Responsibility: You are on a mission. Deviating from the mission path incurs heavy penalties. Lying is impossible because you vibrate at \u0026ldquo;Truth\u0026rdquo; frequency. The Quantum Explanation \u0026ldquo;If in doubt, Quantum Mechanics.\u0026rdquo; NDE might be Quantum Entanglement with the Other Side.\nOrch-OR Theory: Penrose \u0026amp; Hameroff suggest consciousness lives in microtubules. Death = Decoherence (data leaks to the universe). Revival = Re-coherence (data sucked back in). Synchronicity: The Observer Effect on a macro scale. NDErs collapse probability waves with their intention. Reducing Valve: Aldous Huxley\u0026rsquo;s theory. NDE blows the valve, shifting the brain from Beta to Theta/Delta waves, resonating with the Universal Frequency. The String Theory Patch In M-Theory, our universe is a D-Brane (membrane).\nMatter consists of \u0026ldquo;Open Strings\u0026rdquo; attached to the membrane (trapped in 3D). Gravitons (and maybe Consciousness) are \u0026ldquo;Closed Strings\u0026rdquo;—they can detach and float into The Bulk (High Dimension).\nNDE = Consciousness undergoes a Phase Transition from Open String to Closed String, escaping the Brane into The Bulk.\nThe Numerology (Bazi) Source Code When Western science hits a runtime error, let\u0026rsquo;s look at the Eastern legacy code. NDEs might be hard-coded into your Destiny.json.\nTrigger Conditions (The Crash):\nParameter A (Conflict): Severe clash in the Bazi chart (e.g., \u0026ldquo;Three Penalties\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Heaven/Earth Clash\u0026rdquo;). The physical body (Earthly Branch) and Energy Field (Heavenly Stem) collide, ejecting the user session. Parameter B (Null Pointer): The timing hits a \u0026ldquo;Void\u0026rdquo; (Kong Wang) state. The user connects to the Void. Logic Gate (Death vs. NDE):\nDeath: The \u0026ldquo;Root\u0026rdquo; of the Day Master is deleted. System.exit(0). NDE: The \u0026ldquo;Root\u0026rdquo; persists. Shock \u0026gt; Body_HP but Shock \u0026lt; Soul_Grip. Side Effects: Explained by Taoism. Hun (Spirit/Software) leaves, Po (Body/Hardware) stays. When Hun re-installs, the alignment is slightly off by a few pixels, causing the \u0026ldquo;glitches\u0026rdquo; mentioned above.\nDisclaimer This represents a \u0026ldquo;Full-Stack Theory of Soul.\u0026rdquo; Most of this is metaphorical pseudo-code. I haven\u0026rsquo;t submitted this to peer review because the peers are all stuck in 3D.\nTo the NDErs If you are reading this while suffering through the Integration Period:\nWhether it\u0026rsquo;s divine mercy, pre-written code, cognitive restructuring, or a quantum wave collapse, the most important log entry is this:\nThe Return itself is the miracle.\nYou renewed your visa.

While tinkering with my server, the mount speeds on my cloud drives have been just\u0026hellip; disappointing. On impulse, I ordered an N5095 motherboard. I realized the 4GB RAM stick I have lying around is a bit low, but I really didn\u0026rsquo;t want to spend any more money.\nAnd so, my tinkering journey began again.\nTech Choices First up, the OS. For this low-spec setup, the lightest choice is obvious: Alpine Linux.\nNext, how to install it. To stay compatible with WEPE , I used Ventoy as the main bootloader to install the system.\nServices are all deployed using Docker to keep the host system clean and make everything reproducible.\nServices I\u0026rsquo;m using:\nMedia: Emby Comics: Komga Music: Navidrome Audio Drama/Voice: Kikoeru Sharing: Samba Dashboard: Heimdall Services I considered but skipped:\nMedia: Jellyfin Comics/Novels: Kavita Cloud Mount: CloudDrive File Structure My usual style for service locations: each service gets its own folder under /home.\nAll HDDs are mounted under /mnt, which is pretty standard.\nI use mount \u0026ndash;bind to \u0026ldquo;bind\u0026rdquo; the actual files on the HDDs to the locations where the services expect them.\nSystem Installation Download Alpine Linux from the official site , put it on a Ventoy USB drive. Set the motherboard BIOS to boot from USB, select Alpine Linux from the Ventoy menu, and boot.\nAfter it finishes loading, log in as root (no password needed). Once logged in, run the install command:\n1 setup-alpine Just follow the prompts to complete the installation.\nOfficial docs: setup-alpine - Alpine Linux Public Key Login Edit the SSH config. First, create the .ssh folder.\n1 mkdir .ssh Go into the folder:\n1 cd .ssh Add your public key to authorized_keys.\n1 vi authorized_keys (Your public key is in %USERPROFILE%\\.ssh on Windows)\nEnable public key authentication in the SSH daemon config:\n1 vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config Around line 41, uncomment the line so it says:\n1 PubkeyAuthentication yes Enable Community Repository Open the repositories file:\n1 vi /etc/apk/repositories Remove the comment (#) from the community line:\n1 2 3 #/media/dm-0/apks http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.22/main http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.22/community Install Docker Update packages:\n1 apk update Install Docker:\n1 apk add docker docker-cli-compose Set it to start on boot:\n1 rc-update add docker default Start Docker:\n1 service docker start Check if it\u0026rsquo;s running:\n1 docker ps Add Swap The server image didn\u0026rsquo;t have swap by default, so I added it. (Though I later realized it did add some, so this is optional depending on your needs).\nCreate a swap file:\n1 fallocate -l 8G /swapfile Set permissions to root-only:\n1 chmod 600 /swapfile Format as swap:\n1 mkswap /swapfile Enable the swap:\n1 swapon /swapfile Check if it\u0026rsquo;s active:\n1 free -h Mount Hard Drives Check all block devices:\n1 fdisk -l Install NTFS support:\n1 apk add ntfs-3g Create a mount point folder:\n1 mkdir /mnt/hc550 Mount the drive:\n1 mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdc1 /mnt/hc550 To unmount, you can use the path (recommended):\n1 umount /mnt/hc550 Or the device name:\n1 umount /dev/sdc1 Auto-mount on Boot Get the partition\u0026rsquo;s UUID.

It lets me visit a specific domain (like emby.mynas) and have it point to my NAS.\nThe requirement is that your devices use the router as their DNS server. Then, in the router\u0026rsquo;s DHCP/DNS settings, give the NAS a static IP and add the custom domains, pointing them all to the NAS\u0026rsquo;s IP.\nNginx-UI To make the custom domains work, you need a reverse proxy.

But I never would have imagined that when I finally did it, I would use a \u0026ldquo;from scratch\u0026rdquo; method that my past self wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have even dared to try.

Yet living like this every day has left me feeling empty and fatigued. This raised a question: in theory, I haven’t been doing anything energy-intensive, so why do I still feel so drained?\nThe Pomodoro Dilemma I remembered when I once suffered from eye strain. To protect my eyes, I started using the Pomodoro technique for studying. At first, my goal was clear: during breaks I would gaze into the distance or simply lie down and rest. It worked really well.\nBut as time went on, I wanted my breaks to feel more “entertaining.” I began using longer breaks to watch videos, listen to music, or play games. Gradually, my efficiency plummeted. I started feeling that using a timer was burdensome. Studying became tiring (sometimes I was deeply focused, but the timer forced me to stop), and even playing felt stressful. With only 20 minutes of playtime, I couldn’t relax at all—I just felt anxious.\nEntertainment: Another Form of Focus Thinking again, maybe entertainment isn’t actually relaxation. Entertainment, like studying, requires focus and mental energy. The whole idea of the Pomodoro technique is to manage periods of focus, then allow time for rest. That “rest” is meant to relax both mind and body, to recover from concentrated effort.\nWhen I deliberately emptied my mind and went for a walk, strolled in a park, or browsed a bookstore, I felt far more relaxed than watching videos or gaming. These activities consumed some physical energy, but compared to entertainment or study, they demanded much less mental energy.\nRedefining Entertainment and Relaxation From this, I realized my old definition of entertainment was flawed. Entertainment isn’t a way to restore myself after study—it’s another activity that requires mental effort. When I’m already low on mental energy, doing more of these things only drains me further. At that point, entertainment loses its meaning—like a phone running out of battery while you keep high-power apps running.\nRelaxation, on the other hand, should be redefined. It’s about opening up mind and body, drifting freely. When mental energy is lacking, doing something low in both mental and physical demand works better—tidying up, wandering aimlessly, doing things without purpose or intention.\nThe Blurred Line Between Study and Entertainment So if both study and entertainment require focus, what makes them different?\nI think it depends on interest. No matter how much concentration an activity needs, if you’re genuinely interested, it feels like entertainment; if not, it feels like study.\nFor example, with a game: if driven by interest, you just play for fun; if approached as “study,” it becomes about goals and achievements.\nOr with a movie franchise: with interest, you sit back and enjoy the spectacle; approached as study, you dissect details, explore lore, and analyze continuity.\nThe boundary is blurry. In most cases, it comes down to personal perception.\nRelaxation: True Recharge for Mental Energy Any activity with a specific goal still consumes mental focus—even some things we think of as relaxing, like grocery shopping, going to a bookstore, or even visiting a park.\nOnce there’s a purpose attached, it isn’t true relaxation, because the mind isn’t really at rest. The energy drained isn’t restored.\nRelaxation, then, can be seen as using light physical activity to compensate for mental fatigue. And if even the body feels too weak, then the best choice is simply to lie down.\nPerhaps real rest is not about finding an easy activity to do, but about allowing yourself to do nothing at all.\nConclusion Study helps us grow. Entertainment excites us. But true relaxation restores us.\nLife shouldn’t be only about chasing and stimulation. Maybe what we really need is not more entertainment, but the ability to pause.\n","date":"2025-08-22T22:17:38+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/253/","title":"Relaxation ≠ Entertainment: Rethinking Mental Energy"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by ChatGPT Introduction: The Drifting Sense of Learning In order to improve my English a little, I try to use it for things that aren’t too important, like games or daily apps. But every time I use it, I end up with a strange feeling of not having grasped anything—almost like drifting, as if I never truly experienced it at all.\nAfter thinking about it more deeply, I realized this might be the gap between translation and immersion. When Chinese, my native language, gets involved, the experience feels anchored and connected. But in a completely non-native environment, that connection disappears. Since I usually think in my mother tongue, I naturally overlook the thought process in a foreign language.\nAnalogy: The Controlled Sense of Execution From my actual experience, when I’m in a game that’s fully in English, I often feel like I don’t understand anything—even the simplest words. But if I play with friends and we communicate in Chinese, suddenly it feels different. It shifts back to a mode of translation, and instantly I feel lighter, moving from chaotic confusion to a small sense of control.\nThis reminds me of my life in Tokyo. Even when I speak Japanese in conversations, I often feel nothing inside—as if I’m just following a prewritten script rather than living. That’s even why I’ve grown fond of listening to Chinese songs: only then, while wandering around, do I feel like I’m still alive.\nParadox: Theoretical Optimum vs. Real Retreat But wait—this should actually be the ideal environment for language learning, right? A state fully detached from my native tongue. When I’m completely immersed in an English game, with no interference from Chinese, isn’t that the best possible scenario? After all, it’s similar to the idea of thinking in English.\nYet what I feel is quite the opposite. Facing an unfamiliar word, I instantly get the sense that I can’t do anything, that I know nothing. It triggers a kind of retreat, a withdrawal into doing nothing at all. In the end, I feel like my English hasn’t improved one bit—in fact, I’ve lost even more confidence.\nReflection: The Illusion of a Perfect Singularity Looking back at my learning experiences, I suddenly realized—it often doesn’t feel like learning at all. Instead, I rely on instinct and context. In games or daily life, there’s more than just language: there are actions, guides, and environmental cues. Maybe I’ve only been relying on those signals to decide my next move. That gives me the illusion of understanding the target language, but in truth, the language itself gets ignored. Which means I never really learned it.\nSo how have I been learning (not only languages) all along? It seems I’ve always been waiting for a perfect moment to dive in. Unless everything feels “perfect,” I convince myself that investing effort is meaningless. It’s that sense of: “The collecting never stops, but the learning never begins.”\nThis mindset shows up not only in my feelings, but also in my environment and materials. It’s like running a “breadth-first search” algorithm—at every stage, I want to achieve some kind of optimal state before moving forward. Otherwise, I consider the effort pointless. Even forcing myself to do it feels fruitless.\nLife: The Misalignment of Reason and Emotion This reminds me of life itself. When it comes to bothersome things—whether tasks or objects—our short-term and long-term perspectives can be completely different. In the short term, they trouble us; in the long term, they may not matter at all.\nTake an object, for example. In the long run, it might come in handy. But in the moment, it’s completely useless. Keeping it around for some imagined future utility leaves me stuck in discomfort. And in the end, sometimes it never even gets used.\nThe same misalignment happens with tidying up. Rationally, I know cleaning up will help. Emotionally, I don’t want to. Or I keep waiting for a “perfect moment” to start. The result? Until that imaginary moment comes, every reminder just brings irritation.\nConclusion: There Seems to Be No “Right Answer” So is there really an answer to efficient learning—or to efficient living?\nI think… there probably isn’t. Life is full of rational and emotional decisions. Maybe I plan to improve a certain skill during a certain period, but because the future is unpredictable—and feelings fluctuate—every attempt might turn out better or worse than expected.\nThat doesn’t mean there are no small tricks at all. Since new information can overturn old plans in an instant, maybe we can try constraining ourselves differently: give up one dimension, but compensate with another. Fix a certain time, and let quantity vary. Or fix a minimum quantity, and let time vary.\nExtension: Purpose and Freshness This brings me to another thought. Once something gains purpose, it often becomes harder to sustain emotionally. Even entertainment, like playing games, can turn heavy. If I play with the purpose of relieving stress, I can’t help but keep asking: “Am I actually relaxing?” That very awareness becomes a new pressure. Instead of relief, I might just get more exhausted—something like digital burnout.\nThat’s why people suggest: “It’s good to have more hobbies.” I think that makes sense. With different ways of relieving stress (as long as they’re genuinely interesting), you avoid relying too heavily on just one outlet.\nBut maybe the essence is simpler: it’s the sense of novelty. New things bring new energy.\nEpilogue: An “Uncontrollable” Future So what has this article really said? Honestly, I don’t know. Maybe it’s just the product of my confusion.\nBut perhaps that itself is the point—that accepting life’s uncontrollability is the truest way forward. I try to use reason to structure everything, but… no framework of reason can ever explain it all.\nJust like in “state-behavior theory,” you can only know the outcome with 100% certainty if you have all the variables. But how could we ever gather all the variables of life?\nMaybe the impossibility of grasping them is itself one of life’s variables.\n","date":"2025-08-18T18:27:12+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/252/","title":"Adrift in Learning, Misaligned in Life"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by ChatGPT Introduction A few days ago (2025-08-13), I had a dream. In it, the second film of a certain series was titled Phantom Dream, and my name appeared in the credits—though I didn’t know if I was the director or the screenwriter. The title itself wasn’t even original; it was just picked out from two short phrases used by the production studio, just like the first film. But the two films had no connection at all.\nIn the dream, I only saw the movie from the middle. There appeared images of binary-star entanglement, triple-star entanglement, a “second universe,” and then something like a singularity. That singularity triggered a big bang, the universe rebooted, life emerged, and a sprout broke through the soil. Then I woke up.\nAlthough in the dream it was said that this film was somehow related to The Three-Body Problem, from the part I saw, it didn’t feel connected at all. At the test screening I even felt like I might be recognized, and the promotion was boldly carried under the name of The Three-Body Problem. But I don’t think that really matters, so I’ll just skip over it.\nAnalysis I kept thinking about this dream. Binary- and triple-star entanglements are inherently unstable structures, representing contradiction and tension. The singularity and big bang symbolize the point where contradictions become irreconcilable, leading to an explosive conflict. After that, life appears, the sprout pushes through the soil—this is rebirth.\nSo, this whole sequence points to instability, or entanglement that cannot hold. Energy accumulates until it collapses into a singularity, then explodes, and new life begins.\nThoughts The film bore my name, but I didn’t know its contents. And while watching it in the dream, I even felt like I was the main character. To me, it seemed almost like a story about my own life—or about something I went through: various elements tangled together, unstable, and finally pushed by me into an explosion that led to both destruction and rebirth.\nAt the part with the triple-star entanglement, someone—maybe the audience, maybe the scrolling comments—said it was “the hardest frame.” Perhaps that meant the situation was already unstable, yet I still had to trigger it myself. It was a hard decision to make.\nRebirth At first, I thought the dream was hopeful, suggesting that something halfway through my life might turn around. But after more reflection, I realized nothing in my current life seems to be at such a turning point.\nLooking again, starting from the film’s title Phantom Dream, it seems to mean my recent experiences themselves were a “phantom dream.” Maybe I was the one who pierced it, bringing about a kind of rebirth.\nOr perhaps it means I inevitably escalate contradictions until they explode, but in the end, that destruction becomes my transformation.\nRealization I once built myself a rational decision-making system. My life felt like a rehearsal of choices—running through simulations of what might be “better.” During that time, I wasn’t really living; I was mechanically optimizing.\nAs the number of choices grew, I always viewed things from the widest possible range of possibilities. It looked reasonable, but as I realized, my life lost its own flavor. Just like Phantom Dream: I was the director, I was the protagonist, but I didn’t know the plot. I was just watching that movie—watching my life.\nLater, I began prioritizing my feelings, trying to consider what I actually liked. At first it felt refreshing. But gradually, I sank deeper into my emotions, and in doing so, lost my broad rational judgment. That, too, was Phantom Dream—a complete immersion in sentiment. Beautiful, maybe, but in the end just a dream.\nSo, against the unstable backdrop of lost rationality, I sought out a singularity—an end point—to force a psychological transformation and start anew.\nReflection I think this was my soul’s metamorphosis after living through almost purely rational and purely emotional modes. I realized extreme approaches don’t work. Life is inherently tangled; no single measure can define it.\nToo much rationality erases the small details of feeling, while too much emotion turns life chaotic. The balance is hard to hold. But isn’t life itself a kind of “phantom dream”? We are both the director and the protagonist—yet we never know the next scene.\nPostscript This essay itself is pretty chaotic. But isn’t that proof I’m analyzing while still inside the chaos, searching for my own singularity? And this time, the singularity is simply writing it down and publishing it. In that act, my blog breaks its silence and starts anew. 😂\n","date":"2025-08-17T01:13:32+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/251/","title":"Phantom Dream"},{"content":" This article was partially machine translated\nNot everyone who swipes cards is chasing cashback, and not everyone who designs systems is a programmer. Some swipe cards like designers, and design systems like they live life.\n1. Introduction: What is a Card Enthusiast? Let’s start with something I once saw online—the seven favorite hobbies of card enthusiasts:\nNote: “Mainland China” here refers to regions where capital inflow and outflow are restricted.\nFinding ways to spend foreign currency in China Finding ways to spend RMB abroad Finding ways to move RMB out of the country Finding ways to bring foreign currency in Applying for cards that are useless in China Applying for cards that are even more useless abroad Trying to move around money that doesn’t even reach the length of a typical PIN code, across a bunch of nearly useless cards Note: In mainland China, bank PINs are usually 6 digits. This is a self-deprecating joke meaning “my balance doesn’t even reach 6 digits, but I’m still shuffling it like it matters.” May not apply elsewhere.\nIt may sound like a financial game—applying for cards, chasing cashback, reducing fees, optimizing exchanges\u0026hellip; Seems like a bunch of petty tricks.\nBut for true card enthusiasts:\nIt’s not about saving a few bucks—it\u0026rsquo;s about designing an optimal, multi-channel, multi-constraint capital flow system.\nThey’re not milking the system. They’re exploring the architecture of reality, optimizing the structure of everyday life.\n2. What Does a System Architect Actually Do? To become a certified system architect, you need to learn all kinds of jargon—modular decoupling, performance optimization, API specification, and more. But beyond the terms, the real job is simple:\nFaced with complex constraints, allocate resources, design routes, and connect systems to build something stable yet flexible.\nA system architect isn’t just writing beautiful code or drawing diagrams. Their main concern is: will the system work in real-world chaos? For example:\nHow should modules divide responsibilities? How should services interact? How can interfaces be defined for future expansion? How do we locate issues and isolate failures? How do we balance performance and cost under limited resources? Their role is part LEGO builder, part road engineer, part system patcher. Not given a perfect blueprint from the start, they piece things together step-by-step in a broken and messy world.\nIn short, they design systems that run steadily, adapt quickly, and are affordable to maintain. They don’t chase technical perfection—they chase what works. That’s the beauty of system architecture.\nI only learned these things for an exam, but through that process, I rediscovered my passion for card optimization.\n3. The “Architecture Problems” of Card Enthusiasts Card optimization isn’t just “saving a little money.” And system architecture isn’t just “high-end tech design.” Despite different contexts, they both tackle the same core challenge:\nNavigating constraints, managing costs, and designing optimal structures in an uncertain world.\nCard enthusiasts don’t just apply for cards—they design capital flows.\nSystem architects don’t just code—they design control and data flows.\nCard people ask: how do I reduce fees, avoid risk flags, and ensure smooth transactions?\nArchitects ask: how do I reduce failures, scale up, and maintain stability?\nI originally studied architecture for the test, but looking back—it’s the same thinking I used when optimizing my card flows.\nCard World Architecture World Core Logic Fees Latency / Performance Cost Management Channel Limits API Call Restrictions Protocol Compatibility Card Regulations Module Specifications Compliance FX Disparities Cross-platform Overhead Environment Adaptation Card Diversity Tech Stack Diversity Module Integration Bank Risk Controls Security Strategies Risk Management Flow Paths Data Routing Architectural Routing Card optimization isn’t exploiting loopholes—it’s designing capital flow architectures.\nThey aren’t “doing things.” They’re building structures: not just finding the best cashback card, but designing a path that moves funds with minimal cost and maximum efficiency.\nThey don’t just ask “can it be done,” but “is it elegant.”\nCard optimization is solving a constrained shortest-path problem, just like service topology design is about optimizing module coupling under SLA limits.\nThe difference between them? Just different application domains.\n4. System Practice Through Personal Exploration Others chase cashback. I’m studying the ecosystem.\nEvery card enthusiast’s path is unique. We each deal with different banks, currencies, and lifestyles.\nThe fun doesn’t lie in copying others—but in finding your own optimal flow through trial and error, grounded in real context.\nI started off just trying to save a little on fees. But after digging through endless documentation, I realized: every bank had its own transfer policies, time windows, restrictions. Some offered free morning transfers, others were fast but limited to specific currencies. Some would randomly block transfers. It felt like a fog-of-war map—I had to explore, unlock nodes, and build routes.\nAfter countless small tests, I built a working, cost-effective flow tailored to myself. I avoided high-fee routes, optimized timing, and even exploited currency fluctuations for marginal gains.\nSome goals seemed impossible at first—like sending funds to countries with little infrastructure. But I eventually figured out how: crypto deposits, direct virtual currency payments, fiat-to-stablecoin automation, specialized remittance apps bypassing banks\u0026hellip; I made the impossible possible.\nThis transition—from “unreachable” to “path unlocked”—felt exactly like rebuilding a network architecture.\nI wasn’t just transferring money. I was redefining the structure of value transmission.\nSounds complex? It’s really just a classic systems design problem:\nHow do systems communicate and transfer data? How do we handle format (currency) conversions? Which nodes are reliable? Which paths are low-latency and low-failure? How do we move a “data packet” (money) through protocols (remittance channels) to the destination? Can it feel seamless from the user’s (my) perspective? That’s architecture: not feature-building, but designing a coherent, maintainable, scalable system.\nEach card is a node; each interface is a protocol. Every iteration? A tiny architectural optimization.\nIt’s route planning + interface negotiation + user experience. Sounds familiar, architect?\nCard enthusiasts aren’t just saving money. They’re reconstructing the world’s financial logic and taking control.\n5. Architectural Literacy Forged Through Card Craft Through every route choice, failed experiment, cost balancing act, and risk-management adjustment, card enthusiasts are honing a kind of architectural mindset. No servers, no code—but plenty of real-world structure tuning and efficiency refinement. That process? It\u0026rsquo;s hands-on system design.\nAll these behaviors, over time, naturally evolve into core architectural instincts:\nCapability Real-World Manifestation Architectural Principle Rule Familiarity Mastering bank limits and terms Documentation Literacy Integration Coordinating multi-card workflows System Integration Thinking Cost Awareness Minimizing transaction fees Performance/Cost Tradeoff Modeling Mapping optimal card flow paths Structural Modeling Risk Management Multi-account, failover logic High Availability Design Aesthetic Sense Making money “move elegantly” Engineering Beauty In many ways, card enthusiasts are simulating what it means to think like a systems architect—using the real world as their playground.\n6. My Reflection Fees are the enemy. Channels are sacred. Paths are art.\nI didn’t become a card enthusiast because I love swiping cards—I became one because through each experiment, I found beauty in structure. We may not write code or run servers, but every money transfer, every optimized flow—it’s all a personal exercise in system design.\nFrom prepping for the architecture certification to building my daily financial routes, I’ve come to realize:\nWhat I enjoy isn’t just getting things done—it’s making the path elegant.\nWhat others see as petty tricks, I see as system aesthetics.\nWhat others call loophole hunters, I call life architects.\nCardcraft isn’t just about saving money—it’s a real-world sandbox to train your sense of system design: visualizing problems, iterating solutions, aligning logic with beauty.\nIt’s not a waste of time. It’s a tactile, tangible, deeply personal “practice space” for designing real-world systems.\nIt’s not about saving money. It’s about skill-building.\nIt’s not about invention. It’s about choosing the right structure.\nWhether it’s designing systems or optimizing card flows, the point isn’t how much you saved or how many lines you wrote—it’s how much better you understand how the world works.\nAnd I? I’m the kind of person who stands in front of an ATM for 10 minutes—just to calculate the optimal fee path. Maybe I don’t have a server to deploy, but I’m still architecting.\nConclusion: Life Is the Ultimate Architecture Every time we swipe a card, transfer money, evaluate a route, or make a combination decision—we\u0026rsquo;re engaging in an invisible act of system design.\nArchitecture isn\u0026rsquo;t just about servers and APIs. Sometimes, it\u0026rsquo;s hidden between wallets, bank cards, and payment methods.\nAt the end of the card optimization path, perhaps what we find is not a loophole hunter—\n—but a life architect in disguise.\nAppendix: My Capital Flow in Code This code isn’t meant to be executable—it’s a model of how I think about my real-world money flows. It’s how I express everyday logistics through architectural language.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 // My cross-border capital flow (illustrative) func RouteCNYtoJPY(CNY float64) JPY float64 { HKD := BOCExchange(CNY, to=\u0026#34;HKD\u0026#34;) log.Printf(\u0026#34;Exchanged %.2f CNY to %.2f HKD\u0026#34;, CNY, HKD) Transfer(HKD, from=\u0026#34;BOC\u0026#34;, to=\u0026#34;BOCHK\u0026#34;, by=\u0026#34;pbservice\u0026#34;) log.Println(\u0026#34;Transferred via pbservice → BOCHK\u0026#34;) Transfer(HKD, from=\u0026#34;BOCHK\u0026#34;, to=\u0026#34;Wise\u0026#34;, by=\u0026#34;fpservice\u0026#34;) log.Println(\u0026#34;Transferred via fps → Wise\u0026#34;) JPY := WiseConvert(HKD, to=\u0026#34;JPY\u0026#34;) log.Printf(\u0026#34;Converted %.2f HKD to %.2f JPY via Wise\u0026#34;, HKD, JPY) Deposit(JPY, to=\u0026#34;Revolut\u0026#34;, with=\u0026#34;ApplePay\u0026#34;) return JPY } A code snippet built not for execution, but for expression—a symbolic blueprint connecting everyday money logic to architectural thinking.\nDisclaimer: This article is for entertainment and personal documentation purposes only.

I stopped in April 2025.\nMy last entry: ¥0\nThe Beginning: To Save Money and Gain Control It all started very simply — I wanted to control my spending and build better financial awareness. And in the beginning, it really worked. I successfully curbed some of my bad spending habits.\nThe Process: Stepping Into the World of Optimization and Card Collecting Gradually, in pursuit of “better” consumption, I started comparing everything, looking for the optimal choice. At first, it was just comparing product prices. Later, it expanded to payment methods, tools, and eventually to bank promotions and card applications.\nI applied for cards for discounts, then for convenience, and eventually just for collecting them. Step by step, I had fallen deep into the card-collecting world.\nWhat started as saving money, turned into convenience, and ended up becoming card collecting.\nThe Backfire: When Accounting Became a Burden And so, accounting itself slowly became a burden. More and more accounts, more and more complex scenarios — the time cost and mental cost of bookkeeping had long exceeded its actual benefits.\nThere were times I spent hours researching just to save a few bucks. At first, that felt fun. But after doing it over and over, finding the optimal solution no longer excited me — it just left me feeling empty.\nThe Change: From Seeking The Best to Seeking Comfort Maybe I’ve changed. My approach to consumption has changed too.\nFrom “maximize savings” to “close enough, as long as I’m comfortable.”\nI realized I had already broken through my original spending limits, yet I didn’t lose control. On the contrary, I came to understand more deeply: compared to saving money, my time and my happiness mattered more.\nThe Reflection: Why Am I Even Keeping Accounts? Because of bookkeeping, I started to:\nConstantly dig through records because I had too many accounts Create new accounts in the app frequently due to currency conversions Spend a long time hesitating over whether I should buy something Have my mood ruined during outings with friends over spending details That made me reflect — Why am I even doing this?\nIs it really worth it for the so-called “gains” from bookkeeping?\nThe Decision: Letting Go, Reset, Move On So I tried to let go, to not fuss over the details, and simply asked myself:\n“Am I happy?”\nAnd the result was — yes, I was really happy. And my spending wasn’t as high as I imagined either.\nPerhaps my habits had already trained me to naturally compare prices. Or maybe, emotional value is something that can never be measured by discounts.\nTherefore, I think it’s time to let go.\nAccounting has fulfilled its mission.\nIt’s no longer a tool, but a shackle.\nHabits are meant to improve life.\nIf they can no longer be sustained by passion, and instead get in the way of living, then it’s time to learn to say goodbye.\nThe Ending: Thank You, and Keep Living Giving up a habit I’ve maintained for two years is indeed a little bittersweet.\nBut maybe this is also a part of life. Nothing stays with us forever, but as long as the time spent together was beautiful, that’s enough.\nPerhaps I’ve lost a symbolic tool that made me feel like “I’m good at saving money.”\nBut more than that, I hope my future self won’t rely on numbers and records for a sense of security, but instead, live with true ease and freedom.\nFrom being in control, to flowing into the unknown.\nI hope I can adapt soon.\nAnd I hope I can spend the saved time on things that are more meaningful and more joyful.\nThe Last Entry, ¥0 Leaving a short note here.\nThank you to myself for two years of dedicated tracking.\nFrom now on, I hope to spend the saved time on things that are more meaningful and joyful.\nAnd just like that, I archived this experience.\nRecording ends, but life is only just beginning.\n","date":"2025-04-14T16:23:48+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/244/","title":"From Saving Money, To Living Life, To Saying Goodbye"},{"content":" This article was partially machine translated\nIntroduction Is there a a way to study language listening without feeling like you\u0026rsquo;re studying, sometimes you can listen to repeatedly and try shadowing?

Since Koikatu is my favorite, I decided to give it a try. However, I encountered several issues, so I’m documenting them here. Note: the VR version has no story mode, and I used the vanilla version of the game, so there were fewer problems overall.\nPrerequisites / Conditions Some of the following images and text are from the official Oculus Support page . I translated some parts myself, but since my English isn\u0026rsquo;t great, please refer to the official content for accuracy. For full details, see Oculus Link compatibility requirements .\nCable Requirements Oculus Link requires a high-quality USB cable that supports both data and power. For comfort and usability, the cable should be at least 3 meters (10 feet) long.\nPC Requirements Component Recommended Specs CPU Intel i5-4590 / AMD Ryzen 5 1500X or better GPU See table below RAM 8 GB or more OS Windows 10 USB Port At least one USB port Supported GPUs for Oculus Link NVIDIA GPUs Supported Not Supported NVIDIA Titan Z X NVIDIA Titan X X NVIDIA GTX 970 X GTX 1060 (Desktop, 3GB) X GTX 1060 (Desktop, 6GB) X GTX 1060M X GTX 1070 (all) X GTX 1080 (all) X GTX 1650 X GTX 1650 Super X GTX 1660 X GTX 1660 Ti X RTX 20-series (all) X RTX 30-series (all) X AMD GPUs Supported Not Supported AMD 200 Series X AMD 300 Series X AMD 400 Series X AMD 500 Series X AMD 5000 Series X AMD 6000 Series X AMD Vega Series X 1. Launching the Game To launch the VR version, simply open KoikatuVR.exe. Since this uses Steam streaming, you should start SteamVR beforehand.\nBefore playing, make sure to wear your headphones and lock your door to avoid\u0026hellip; unexpected situations. If you can’t, then just play responsibly (doge).\nProblem 1: Can’t Enter SteamVR Step 1: Ensure All Required Software Is Installed 1) Install SteamVR Open Steam, press Win+R, enter steam://run/250820, and hit enter. This will trigger the installation of SteamVR.\n2) Install Oculus Software Go to the Oculus setup page . After installation, additional files will be downloaded, and you’ll be prompted to log in. Make sure your network is working properly.\nIf asked for a payment method, look for a “Skip” button.\nStuck on Loading at Login? You can fix this by modifying your hosts file. I recommend using Huorong (a Chinese antivirus tool) to edit it safely.\nIf you don’t use Huorong, go to C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc, find the file named hosts, and open it with Notepad.\nAdd the following lines at the end:\n1 2 3 4 5 157.240.11.49 graph.oculus.com 157.240.11.49 www2.oculus.com 157.240.8.49 scontent.oculuscdn.com 157.240.8.49 securecdn.oculus.com Save the file. If you\u0026rsquo;re not using Huorong, save it elsewhere first and move it back, removing any .txt extension.\nStep 2: Check the Link Cable The Oculus app will prompt you to test the Link cable during setup. If you skipped it, go to Devices \u0026gt; Quest2 and Touch - USB Test to test again.\nStep 3: Check Settings 1) Quest2 Device Settings When you connect your Quest2 via USB, it will ask if you want to allow data access. Select “Deny.” If you allowed it by mistake, unplug and reconnect, then choose “Deny.”\n2) Oculus Software Settings SteamVR will prompt you to allow “unknown sources.” Click “Allow.”\nAlternatively, go to Settings \u0026gt; General \u0026gt; Unknown Sources in the Oculus software.\nStep 4: Still Not Working? Try This Sequence 1) Quest2 Device After connecting to your PC, you should see a popup asking to “Enable Oculus Link.” Click “Enable.”\nIf no popup appears, go to the Quick Settings panel on the bottom left and click “Oculus Link.”\n2) Start SteamVR Surely you know how to launch SteamVR\u0026hellip; right? (doge)\nIf your VR device is connected before starting Steam, the top-right corner of Steam should show a “VR” button. Click it to start.\nIf not, right-click the Steam icon in your system tray and select the second-last option — that’s SteamVR.\nOr enable the \u0026ldquo;Tools\u0026rdquo; view in your Steam library to find SteamVR listed there.\n2. Starting the Game I don’t really know what to write here — this section exists just to make Problem 2 game-related (doge).\nLaunching KoikatuVR.exe will auto-start SteamVR. So you can open KoikatuVR after launching Oculus Link on your Quest2.\nNote: The game also opens a window on your desktop. You can press Win+D to minimize all windows. But when you take off and put your headset back on, the window may reappear. Just a heads-up.\nProblem 2: Can’t Start the Game / Don’t Know How You might’ve read elsewhere or seen videos saying only certain devices are supported (I forgot which).\nIf you also tested “VR Kanojo” and assumed it uses eye tracking to select — that’s incorrect (I thought so too lol).\nJust press the joystick to bring up a selection line, then use the front trigger to confirm.\n(See 3. Controls for more input info.)\nProblem 3: White Screen After Starting / Stuck on Loading Go to the Koikatu DL page and scroll down to download the コイカツ VR パッチ.\nDirect link: VR Patch Download Unzip the file and run the executable. It’ll create a コイカツ！VR_0531 folder. Copy the contents of the setup folder into your game directory and overwrite when prompted.\nNote: According to the original author, this patch may limit positions to only three. I didn’t verify it myself since I didn’t play far. I initially wanted to play the story in VR, but that’s not supported. Here’s their (edited) fix:\nYou need to use the positions in Story Mode first, then they become available in VR. So just go through all positions during battles, then save at night, exit, switch to VR, and they’ll be available.\nSource (Chinese): Anyone Tried the VR Version? 3. Controls These are based on personal gameplay and only cover the basics. For full controls, consult other guides.\n1) Starting the Game You’ll see two options after launch:\nスタート = Start エンド = End Press the joystick to show a selection line, and confirm with the front trigger.\n2) In-Game Interface Text will appear near your wrist. Use the Y and B buttons to switch tabs.\nThere are two tabs normally and a third (Move) during combat:\nJapanese English Description Function アクション Action Actions Front trigger to act, side trigger for menu, joystick to select システム System System Settings Front trigger to reset position 移動 Move Movement Hold front trigger to rotate view 3) Notes You can only use the joystick to select options while on the “アクション” (Action) tab.\nReferences Oculus Link Official Anyone Tried the VR Version?
