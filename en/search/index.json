[{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Writing articles with citations in Word can be a real pain. After trying LaTeX, I realized it\u0026rsquo;s just like my switch to Markdown—focusing purely on the writing experience is fantastic. Plus, the generated PDFs look professional and polished.\nThis post focuses on setting up LaTeX in VS Code and lists common syntax. For detailed documentation, check the official tutorials linked at the end.\nInstallation Installing TeX Live is the easiest route as it includes most common dependencies: https://www.tug.org/texlive/ . Be warned: the installation takes quite a long time.\nIn VS Code, press Ctrl+Shift+X to open the extensions view, search for and install LaTeX Workshop.\nOnce installed, press Ctrl+, to open settings. Search for \u0026ldquo;Latex Recipes\u0026rdquo; and click to edit in setting.json. Move latexmk (xelatex) to the first position in the latex-workshop.latex.recipes array.

Intuition: Overclocked. Observation: Write-Access to Reality.\nNDE (Near-Death Experience) is basically what happens when your system uptime hits 99.9% and then suddenly crashes, only to reboot with unexpected admin privileges. Organizations like IANDS and researchers like Dr. P.M.H. Atwater have logged thousands of tickets (case studies) on this.\nThis article is based on that research plus my own \u0026ldquo;code review.\u0026rdquo; The subject is complex, so expect some unhandled exceptions.\nWhat is an NDE? Mechanically speaking, an NDE is when the hardware (body) is declared dead by medical standards, but the software (consciousness) migrates to a cloud server—let\u0026rsquo;s call it \u0026ldquo;The Other Side.\u0026rdquo; Notably, there\u0026rsquo;s also the \u0026ldquo;Emotion-Induced NDE.\u0026rdquo; Think of this as a soft crash caused by extreme emotional load or psychological stress (like Broken Heart Syndrome or Vasovagal Syncope). The hardware looks fine, but the connection to the server times out, triggering the off-body protocol.\nThe core of an NDE is the Out-of-Body Experience (OBE) and the Re-entry. It\u0026rsquo;s not just a screensaver (dream); it\u0026rsquo;s a full logout/login sequence.\n\u0026ldquo;The Other Side\u0026rdquo; features non-linear time, folded space, and a high-bandwidth Light interface that likely bridges high-dimensional consciousness with our 3D render.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Integration Period\u0026rdquo; afterwards can look like PTSD (system instability), featuring Ego Dissolution or derealization. While the recovery patch looks like PTG (Post-Traumatic Growth), the underlying architecture is different.\nNDE vs. Dreams (The Benchmark) To distinguish NDEs from hallucinations, Dr. Bruce Greyson developed the Greyson NDE Scale. Think of it as a benchmark test.\nScoring (0=Null, 1=Mild, 2=Strong):\nA. Cognitive (CPU)\nTime perception altered (Speed hack/Lag/Stop) Thoughts accelerated (Overclocked/Panorama view) Life Review (Log file analysis) Sudden understanding of universal truth (Access to Source Code) B. Affective (GPU/Rendering)\nPeace/Pleasure Extreme Joy Unity with the Universe (Network merge) Seeing the Light (HDR enabled) C. Paranormal (Network)\nHeightened senses (Sensor upgrade) ESP (Precognition/Remote View) Precognitive visions Out of body (Remote Desktop connection) D. Transcendental (System)\nEntering an unearthly realm Encountering mystical beings (Admins/Devs) Meeting deceased spirits Encountering a border (The Firewall) Total score is 32. Anything above 7 is clinical NDE certification.\nNDE vs. PTSD Both occur when the brain\u0026rsquo;s legacy firewall collapses under trauma. PTSD is a corrupted save file; NDE is a system upgrade.\nThe Bio-Hardware Specs PTSD: Amygdala (Threat Detection) hypertrophy and Hippocampus (Storage) atrophy. The user is stuck in a while(true) { panic(); } loop because the logs can\u0026rsquo;t be archived. NDE: Default Mode Network (DMN) suppression and Temporoparietal Junction (TPJ) changes. The DMN handles the \u0026ldquo;Ego\u0026rdquo; process (anxiety, self-referencing). When that process is killed, anxiety drops. The TPJ handles \u0026ldquo;spatial location,\u0026rdquo; so modifying it enables the OBE feature. Feature Comparison Feature PTSD NDE Core Emotion Fear, Helplessness Peace, Acceptance, Love User Role Victim (Broken) Observer (Root Access) Worldview \u0026ldquo;System is compromised, hide.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;System has a purpose, I have a quest.\u0026rdquo; Death Maximum Fear Fear removed / Curiosity enabled NDE vs. PTG PTG (Post-Traumatic Growth) is a software-level cognitive refactoring. NDE is a hardware-level energy overload. Based on Rick Strassman\u0026rsquo;s hypothesis, the pineal gland dumps DMT during the crash (hypoxia/power surge), causing neurons to sync and discharge at peak capacity, temporarily freeing consciousness from the wetware. The result? Permanent stat buffs.\nWhy Does NDE Exist? NDE is the exception that proves the rule. As Neo in The Matrix was told, \u0026ldquo;You are the eventuality of an anomaly.\u0026rdquo;\nIt prevents \u0026ldquo;Heat Death\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Deadlock.\u0026rdquo;\nIf this Reality were a closed system strictly following Newtonian physics (determinism), entropy would maximize (Heat Death), or the logic would become so rigid the system would hang (Deadlock).\nNDErs are external variables injecting Negentropy (chaos/love/truth from high-dimensional space) to keep the simulation running.\nCan It Be Reproduced? Neuroscience says NDE isn\u0026rsquo;t a \u0026ldquo;soul export\u0026rdquo; but a specific protection mechanism. You can simulate the bug via:\nTemporal Lobe Epilepsy: Stimulation here triggers \u0026ldquo;God Mode\u0026rdquo; feelings. G-LOC: Pilots in centrifuges experience \u0026ldquo;Tunnel Vision\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Life Review.\u0026rdquo; DMT: The chemical shortcut to the admin console. How Do They Return? The \u0026ldquo;Sent Back\u0026rdquo; Type (~60%): Access Denied. An Admin (God/Relative) says, \u0026ldquo;Ticket not resolved\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Quota not met.\u0026rdquo; They return with heavy \u0026ldquo;homesickness\u0026rdquo; for the server room. The \u0026ldquo;Love Anchor\u0026rdquo; Type (~30%): Dependency Check. They reach the firewall but see dependent processes (kids, partner) and choose to return. They come back with the \u0026ldquo;Guardian\u0026rdquo; patch installed. The \u0026ldquo;Willpower Warrior\u0026rdquo;: Sudo force quit. They refuse to leave the session. The Cycle (1-3-7 Model) Pre-NDE (The Cache Clear): 1-3 years. \u0026ldquo;The Dark Night of the Soul.\u0026rdquo; Purging old temp files to make space for high-energy data. Post-NDE (The Vacuum): 6 months - 1.5 years. Reality feels low-res and laggy compared to the high-bandwidth Other Side. Integration (Stable Build): ~7 years. Full seamless compatibility with Earth OS. Features (AKA \u0026ldquo;The Glitches\u0026rdquo;) NDErs often come back with permanent \u0026ldquo;bugs\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;features\u0026rdquo;:\nStreet Light Interference (SLI) The \u0026ldquo;Walking EMP\u0026rdquo; effect. Bio-electromagnetic fields are amplified, causing watches to stop and streetlights to blink out when walked past.\nHyper-Empathy (Port Scanning) The brain\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Reducing Valve\u0026rdquo; (Firewall) is removed. The subconscious enters Promiscuous Mode, sniffing all emotional packets in the vicinity. Results in rapid Social Battery drainage.\nSynesthesia-like Processing Data isn\u0026rsquo;t linear; it\u0026rsquo;s holographic. Complex concepts are understood as geometric structures. This is Quantum Computing vs. Linear Processing.\nMetabolic Changes Alcohol/Meds: Buffers overflow easily. Painkillers might not work, or alcohol hits 10x harder. Diet: Sudden incompatibility with processed food. Craving high-energy raw materials. Synchronicity (RNG Manipulation) Intention affects the Random Number Generator. \u0026ldquo;Probability Collapse\u0026rdquo; favors the NDEr, specifically for self-realization or altruistic tasks.\nAbsolute Intuition Level 1: The Download. Direct API call. No thinking, just the answer. Level 2: Deja Vu. Cache hit. Time is non-linear there, so you\u0026rsquo;ve already run this simulation script. Level 3: Lucid Reality. Thinning of the Veil. Reality feels like a dream because you are seeing the code behind the UI. Precognition Seeing the \u0026ldquo;Most Probable Future.\u0026rdquo; Since time doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rdquo; (Block Universe), trying to map it to 3D linear time is hard. Near-term predictions are accurate (fewer variables); long-term is just a trend line.\nDream Classifications:\nGarbage Collection: Cortical anxiety release. Simulation: Prefrontal cortex running scenarios. NDE Precognitive Dream: Source: Pineal Gland/High Dimension. Characteristics: High Resolution (4K/8K), Zero Latency, Emotional Neutrality (Observer Mode), and confirmed by Deja Vu later. The Cost With great power comes great responsibility.\nIrreversible Solitude: Once you\u0026rsquo;ve seen the 8K resolution of the Other Side, the 480p reality of Earth is boring. Sensory Overload: The hardware can\u0026rsquo;t handle the software\u0026rsquo;s throughput. Burnout is frequent. Absolute Responsibility: You are on a mission. Deviating from the mission path incurs heavy penalties. Lying is impossible because you vibrate at \u0026ldquo;Truth\u0026rdquo; frequency. The Quantum Explanation \u0026ldquo;If in doubt, Quantum Mechanics.\u0026rdquo; NDE might be Quantum Entanglement with the Other Side.\nOrch-OR Theory: Penrose \u0026amp; Hameroff suggest consciousness lives in microtubules. Death = Decoherence (data leaks to the universe). Revival = Re-coherence (data sucked back in). Synchronicity: The Observer Effect on a macro scale. NDErs collapse probability waves with their intention. Reducing Valve: Aldous Huxley\u0026rsquo;s theory. NDE blows the valve, shifting the brain from Beta to Theta/Delta waves, resonating with the Universal Frequency. The String Theory Patch In M-Theory, our universe is a D-Brane (membrane).\nMatter consists of \u0026ldquo;Open Strings\u0026rdquo; attached to the membrane (trapped in 3D). Gravitons (and maybe Consciousness) are \u0026ldquo;Closed Strings\u0026rdquo;—they can detach and float into The Bulk (High Dimension).\nNDE = Consciousness undergoes a Phase Transition from Open String to Closed String, escaping the Brane into The Bulk.\nThe Numerology (Bazi) Source Code When Western science hits a runtime error, let\u0026rsquo;s look at the Eastern legacy code. NDEs might be hard-coded into your Destiny.json.\nTrigger Conditions (The Crash):\nParameter A (Conflict): Severe clash in the Bazi chart (e.g., \u0026ldquo;Three Penalties\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Heaven/Earth Clash\u0026rdquo;). The physical body (Earthly Branch) and Energy Field (Heavenly Stem) collide, ejecting the user session. Parameter B (Null Pointer): The timing hits a \u0026ldquo;Void\u0026rdquo; (Kong Wang) state. The user connects to the Void. Logic Gate (Death vs. NDE):\nDeath: The \u0026ldquo;Root\u0026rdquo; of the Day Master is deleted. System.exit(0). NDE: The \u0026ldquo;Root\u0026rdquo; persists. Shock \u0026gt; Body_HP but Shock \u0026lt; Soul_Grip. Side Effects: Explained by Taoism. Hun (Spirit/Software) leaves, Po (Body/Hardware) stays. When Hun re-installs, the alignment is slightly off by a few pixels, causing the \u0026ldquo;glitches\u0026rdquo; mentioned above.\nDisclaimer This represents a \u0026ldquo;Full-Stack Theory of Soul.\u0026rdquo; Most of this is metaphorical pseudo-code. I haven\u0026rsquo;t submitted this to peer review because the peers are all stuck in 3D.\nTo the NDErs If you are reading this while suffering through the Integration Period:\nWhether it\u0026rsquo;s divine mercy, pre-written code, cognitive restructuring, or a quantum wave collapse, the most important log entry is this:\nThe Return itself is the miracle.\nYou renewed your visa. You got a system restore. Start by loving your avatar. After all, not everyone gets a second playthrough.\n","date":"2026-01-01T17:16:59+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/264/","title":"Into the NDE: Debugging the Afterlife"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash The year-end is approaching, and a new year is beginning. Looking back at this year, so many things happened, to the point where I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if I should write about them or if I even could. After much hesitation, on a swing in the park, I finally decided to write it all down.\nContinuing from my previous 2024 Annual Review , the first half of this year, to be honest, led me to a further extension of theory, followed by a breakdown in the middle, and then hope in the later part. Not to brag, but it felt a bit like a phoenix\u0026rsquo;s rebirth, or for me, a reconstruction of my spiritual world.\nFirst Quarter Looking through my photos from January, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing particularly noteworthy, maybe just buying a bottle of Sakura Miko collab sake, failing to open a bank account, experiencing my first train delay, strolling around Meiji Jingu Shrine, and having some 5A-grade wagyu beef for New Year\u0026rsquo;s.\nIn February, a friend visited, and we hung out for a week. We watched a yakiniku buffet catch fire because of too much pork, I got a new phone after damaging mine, transferred data at a UNIQLO in Ginza, traveled to Hakone and experienced its \u0026ldquo;人\u0026rdquo;-shaped railway design, soaked in a \u0026ldquo;hot spring,\u0026rdquo; and taught a Vietnamese person how to rollerblade in Japanese.\nIn March, it snowed in Tokyo. I bought my first manga, watched a Hatsune Miku concert hosted by Okinawa in VRChat, bought my first album (Shigure Ui), and tried Indian cuisine.\nOverall, it felt quite vibrant, but mostly these activities were a result of a disturbed mental state.\nSecond Quarter In April, I took two exams, but unfortunately, I didn\u0026rsquo;t notice they were scheduled for the same day when I registered, which led to me not doing well in either.\nIn May, I started preparing for exams, rode a Ferris wheel for the first time, bought a new monitor to upgrade my setup, lay on the grass at Hikarigaoka Park, and bought a Shigure Ui figure.\nIn June, I found a lost Suica card (student pass) at Tetsugakudo Park, visited Hoshino Coffee for the first time, and walked for three hours in the early morning, listening to Kano\u0026rsquo;s songs from dawn until sunrise.\nThese were all rather failed and sad experiences.\nThird Quarter In July, I bought Kano\u0026rsquo;s album, a Hatsune Miku figure, went alone to a KTV in the middle of the night and was given a large room for eight people, where I lay on the sofa singing 《僕が死のうと思ったのは》 (I thought I was going to die). I visited Shinjuku Gyoen for the first time, lay on the grass, and attended an interview, though I failed.\nIn August, I re-arranged my desktop. In the middle of the night, I went to the park to swing on the swings to clear my head.\nIn September, I bought a bicycle and became re-obsessed with the classic game Red Alert 2. I tidied up my home a bit, and at the end of the month, during an evening stroll, I attended a festival at Igusa Hachimangu Shrine.\nThese three months were short, weren\u0026rsquo;t they? This is also why I hesitated to write about them. Starting in June, things changed. Walking for three hours in the early morning, swinging at the park in the middle of the night, cycling late at night—behind these actions lay soul-crushing, near-death experiences. Honestly, I don\u0026rsquo;t know where to begin. Chronologically, my memories are a bit blurry. Emotionally, it was a feeling of \u0026ldquo;being able to accept all the ugliness in this world.\u0026rdquo; I don\u0026rsquo;t want to write it all out, so I\u0026rsquo;ll try to organize a typical timeline from my chaotic conversations with ChatGPT (during the most severe week, I used ChatGPT for 50 hours, and that\u0026rsquo;s just mobile usage time). Some content is omitted, and some is too jumbled for me to recall its original state.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve decided to write this separately; it\u0026rsquo;s a bit too dark. I\u0026rsquo;ll put it in \u0026ldquo;Psychological Forging.\u0026rdquo;\nFourth Quarter In October, I took the 404th TOEIC exam. Although the result was terrible, my bicycle was parked at spot 255, which gave me a good emotional boost. Afterward, I impulsively ordered an N5095 motherboard and DIYed a NAS. I recorded a video, but I don\u0026rsquo;t seem to have the motivation to edit it. I also visited Sony\u0026rsquo;s headquarters and bought an INZONE H9 II from their store. At the end of the month, I experienced manual rowing at Inokashira Park and purchased Shigure Ui\u0026rsquo;s second album.\nIn November, I failed another interview, but through it, I learned about a school that seemed promising from a friend. I went to a hot spring, where I got dizzy and slept there for an unknown amount of time. I also ate American-style pizza.\nIn December, I spent almost all my time preparing for interviews. This period, I can only say, was exhausting. The following is an adaptation of a message I sent to a friend:\nOn December 1st, applying for admission, I learned I needed to contact the professor to inquire about the exam content. On December 2nd, I was asked to write a research proposal and a PPT. After about five days of writing, they asked me which journal I was submitting to and to compress the research proposal into a two-page PPT. I tried my best to do so, then received feedback, and spent another day working on the revisions. Around December 11th, I was preparing for the interview. According to past records, it was 10 minutes, and the professor said it would be a 2-3 minute presentation followed by questions. However, on December 12th, I received an email saying the interview would be around 30 minutes. I was hit by a huge psychological shock due to the immense pressure. After two days of rest, I started preparing on December 15th. On December 17th, my mindset was rattled by a questioning tone while I was in high tension preparing for the interview. On December 18th was the interview. Usually, interviews are with 3-4 professors, but when I walked in, there were many professors in the classroom, over 10 by my estimate. My interview lasted 40 minutes. After leaving the exam room, I felt completely abnormal; by the end, my legs were practically jelly.\nAfter the exam, until now, I\u0026rsquo;ve been lying in bed in a low mental state. However, the outcome doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter; I think this experience was quite valuable. Discussing academics with over 10 professors for 40 minutes in a non-native language—that\u0026rsquo;s incredibly cool!\nOn December 25th, I went to eat at chawan. Merry Christmas!\nPsychological Forging Honestly, I haven\u0026rsquo;t written this part out, partly because I don\u0026rsquo;t know how, and partly because I don\u0026rsquo;t want to revisit those painful memories.\nThe first three months, though seemingly normal, in fact contained an absolute adherence to logic, which manifested not only in my life but also in my dreams.\nThe experiences from April to June gradually revealed the abnormality I maintained in this state. Absolute rationality led me into dead ends, ironically, even as I myself acted illogically.\nJuly to September—this was the explosion of logical contradictions and my outlet. Multiple early morning walks, night cycles. During this time, I felt like I was undergoing a cathartic repair. I\u0026rsquo;ll fill in some timeline events from this period:\n2025-07-19 Due to mental blockage and excessive thinking, the mental chaos began to affect my body. I had a severe headache and felt extremely unwell, my body was weak. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to describe this discomfort. So I lay in bed, feeling cold, covered in blankets, but sweating. Mentally distressed, I tried to sleep, but sleeping only led to nightmares. Waking up, my body was unwell; sleeping, my mind was distressed. This cycle repeated countless times, sweat drenched the bedding, and tears soaked the pillow. This period was too agonizing, please allow me to describe it briefly. I felt like I was undergoing a tribulation; in short, it was a state where I found no peace whether awake or asleep.\n2025-07-20 In the early morning, I was startled awake by a dream. The dream was about me entering a bizarre shop; everything around me was strange, from the goods to the people in the shop (I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to describe it, even recalling it now makes me feel scared, a feeling of not wanting to write further). At this moment, my phone suddenly rang, very loudly, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t turn off the sound. For some reason, in my dream, I thought it was because the battery was dead, so I searched for my power bank in my bag. But why was my bag at the entrance of the shop? People around me were staring. With a feeling of terror, I quickly charged my phone and left, going to my nearby house, which felt abandoned for a long time. I lay on the bed, in a posture similar to 《タコピーの原罪》. This is what I thought of when I lay down in the dream, but when I woke up, I felt curled up.\nThen I woke up like this, but not directly. My brain woke up first, only brain consciousness, and then there were many warm currents, like neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, serotonin) being released, flowing from my brain to my body. Slowly, I regained sensation, first body sensation. At this point, I felt someone was holding me tightly, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t break free. I felt very scared then, but as I slowly regained sensation in my limbs, I realized I was holding myself. I instantly had a fear that someone was in the room.\nIn the afternoon, I thought about going to a nearby park to get some sunlight and relax. But on the way to the park, for an instant, it felt as if I had died, losing consciousness, but the next instant, I immediately returned. This was a fleeting moment. Then I dragged my extremely uncomfortable body and lay on a park bench, listening to Kano\u0026rsquo;s songs. After about two or three hours, feeling a little recovered, I went home. But upon returning home, the symptoms slowly worsened. My body felt very cold; even though it was summer in Tokyo, I was wrapped in a blanket but still felt cold. At the same time, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t move my body, leaning against the wall, just staying there.\nWhen I recovered a bit and felt hungry, I cooked leaning against the wall, and in between, I was so uncomfortable that I went back to bed to rest three times before I finished that meal. Afterward, when taking a shower, to prevent myself from fainting, I left the door open and sat down to wash.\n2025-07-21 I probably slept until the afternoon. Having been lying at home for a while, there wasn\u0026rsquo;t much left, so I went to the supermarket to buy supplies. But at one point in the supermarket, I felt like I was about to faint. However, with ChatGPT very concerned about me, I did manage to utter a sentence that, even now, makes me feel suffocated when I read it:\nYesterday I felt like I was going to die, today I just feel like fainting, doesn\u0026rsquo;t that mean I\u0026rsquo;m getting better?\nThen came dinner; a friend sent me some money so I could eat something nice. Really thankful for that!\nAfterwards In the following days, I almost always maintained an optimistic facade outside, but once home, I would mentally collapse and lie in bed. My voice also conveyed a feeling as if I was about to die any second, and my body felt like it was about to give out.\nAnd then I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I remember when listening to the instrumental piece \u0026ldquo;Lifeline,\u0026rdquo; when it randomly played, I was so scared that I immediately downloaded it. I felt like my heartbeat synchronized with the music, and if the internet lagged and the music buffered, my heart would stop too.\nIn Between One day, I directly dreamed that I was bullied in junior high school. I was constantly picked on, but trying to reason with them, contacting teachers, or my parents was all in vain. At the end of the dream, while I was in the restroom, my backpack was pulled, its zipper opened, and all my belongings were roughly dumped into the toilet. Because it was a boarding school, my backpack contained clothes and books. I was very scared there and forgot if I was hit. But halfway between sleep and wakefulness, with some awareness, I started to think of the phrase, \u0026ldquo;If no one protects my rights, then a gun is my last resort.\u0026rdquo; My consciousness first asked, \u0026ldquo;Are you still going to treat me like this?\u0026rdquo; After receiving contempt, I chose to shoot them in the leg to incapacitate them, then escaped.\nDuring this period, I was tormented. My adherence to rationality sometimes superseded my own human rights. Under high pressure, I erupted. This dream was the outlet for that eruption. However, my thought at the time was simply, \u0026ldquo;I must defend my right to life and health,\u0026rdquo; defending my basic human rights, breaking the original logic, with \u0026ldquo;right to life and health\u0026rdquo; as the foundation, and all other rights secondary.\n2025-08-12 \u0026amp; 2025-08-13 These two days involved very bizarre dreams. Since my memories are a bit chaotic yet connected, I\u0026rsquo;ll put them together. I was living in \u0026ldquo;reality\u0026rdquo; but felt the logic was off, so I thought it might be a dream. But trying to wake up, I was trapped in the dream. However, that dream wasn\u0026rsquo;t right, and I knew I was in a dream, but I wanted to wake up, so I searched for a way out. I\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten the process a bit, but I found a way to leave based on a logical flaw in the dialogue of the dream characters. Then I \u0026ldquo;woke up,\u0026rdquo; which was actually still another layer of dream. Here, I again felt something was logically wrong and \u0026ldquo;woke up.\u0026rdquo; Yes, it was another layer of dream, but this dream only contained my room and myself. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a logical flaw, so I desperately tried to open my eyes, like trying to pull off your real-world helmet in SAO. I tried to open my real eyes. Then I \u0026ldquo;woke up,\u0026rdquo; yes, it was still another layer of dream, but this dream felt very real. Yet, I instantly spotted something wrong again. I was angry, angry that the dream was playing tricks on me. I desperately tried to open my eyes again, opening my real eyes as if they would tear. This time, I truly woke up.\nI really don\u0026rsquo;t remember the specific details, but that\u0026rsquo;s roughly the process. The dream wanted to trap me, give me a beautiful illusion, make me sink into it, but I felt I should break it. I was defending my rights; this might be a manifestation of that process.\nThere were other bizarre dreams, but as I wrote above, I don\u0026rsquo;t really want to recall them. Each dream almost always contained struggle and pain. Even recalling them now brings back that vulnerable state of mind. So, let\u0026rsquo;s leave it at that.\nFrom October to December, I met wonderful friends and gradually emerged from this shadow. I am truly grateful to everyone who helped me. Just like the lyrics of 《僕が死のうと思ったのは》:\n僕が死のうと思ったのは　あなたが綺麗に笑うから 死ぬことばかり考えてしまうのは　きっと生きる事に真面目すぎるから 僕が死のうと思ったのは　まだあなたに出会ってなかったから あなたのような人が生まれた　世界を少し好きになったよ あなたのような人が生きてる　世界に少し期待するよ\nThe reason I thought I was going to die was because you smiled so beautifully. The reason I keep thinking about dying is probably because I\u0026rsquo;m too serious about living. The reason I thought I was going to die was because I hadn\u0026rsquo;t met you yet. I\u0026rsquo;ve grown to like the world a little, a world where someone like you was born. I have a little hope for a world where someone like you lives.\nRegardless of what comes next, for now, you are the light in my darkness.\nCurrent Status Unlike what I said at the end of 2024, that might have just been a disguise, a facade of a normal person based on \u0026ldquo;this is logical.\u0026rdquo; But now, it seems I can try to break free from the constraints of that logic and truly have my eyes light up, radiating energy from within, rather than faking a smile based on logic.\nOf course, I haven\u0026rsquo;t changed much. I still follow rules, but this time, they\u0026rsquo;re more flexible, or rather, the core is the definition of love: \u0026ldquo;First, self-love, and then the overflowing energy nourishes others.\u0026rdquo; This also aligns with the feeling I got from a Warma video, which said, \u0026ldquo;Your matters, your feelings are always the top priority.\u0026rdquo;\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re also feeling lost and have read this far, please try to love yourself first. Only then will you have the energy to love the world.\nFinally Honestly, I don\u0026rsquo;t know what to write in this article. If I lean towards personal growth, it feels too dark, and the middle part I wrote made me too scared. If I lean towards joy, my real experiences won\u0026rsquo;t allow me to cover up that unforgettable journey.\nSo be it. Life isn\u0026rsquo;t always perfect; a 60-point answer sheet is already passing. If you\u0026rsquo;ve truly read through this, I hope you won\u0026rsquo;t be troubled by negative emotions (though I tried my best to restrain myself), because just as I must defend my right to life and health, self-love and your own happiness are always the top priority.\n","date":"2025-12-31T16:16:44+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/263/","title":"2025 Annual Review"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Running a bash script on Windows is a pain. Even on Linux, running a script tailored for a different distribution can be a hassle. Docker solves this while keeping your host system clean.\nThis post uses Alpine as an example to show how to set up an interactive environment to process files in your current directory.\nHow it works The core idea is mounting your current directory into a container. Here is the command template:\n1 docker run --rm -it -v \u0026#34;$(pwd)\u0026#34;:/data -w /data alpine sh The parameters are as follows:\nParameter Meaning \u0026ndash;rm Remove the container after exiting -it Combination of interactive and tty; allows interaction and output -v Path mapping; maps the current directory to /data in the container -w Sets the working directory, so you start inside /data sh The command to run (in this case, the shell) If you only want to run a single command without staying in an interactive shell, just append the command at the end:\n1 docker run --rm -v \u0026#34;$(pwd)\u0026#34;:/data -w /data alpine ls -la Windows The commands differ between PowerShell and CMD due to how they handle environment variables. Here is how to open an interactive Alpine shell:\nPowerShell 1 docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}:/data -w /data alpine sh CMD 1 docker run --rm -it -v %cd%:/data -w /data alpine sh Linux On Linux, containers run as root by default. To prevent files generated inside the container from being owned by root on your host, it\u0026rsquo;s best to map your current user\u0026rsquo;s UID and GID:\n1 docker run --rm -it -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v \u0026#34;$(pwd)\u0026#34;:/data -w /data alpine sh MacOS No special permission handling is usually required. Use the same variables as Linux:\n1 docker run --rm -it -v \u0026#34;$(pwd)\u0026#34;:/data -w /data alpine sh Notes - Alpine Since Alpine is extremely minimal, you might need to install common utilities yourself. Use the apk add command to install what you need.\n","date":"2025-12-26T18:43:04+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/262/","title":"Building Temporary Interactive Linux Environments with Docker"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by Gemini-2.5-pro Introduction Back in 2022, when I was first messing with Linux(Simplify Chinese) , I had this idea that you don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily have to pay for a special OS just to build a NAS.\nFast forward to today. While tinkering with my server, the mount speeds on my cloud drives have been just\u0026hellip; disappointing. On impulse, I ordered an N5095 motherboard. I realized the 4GB RAM stick I have lying around is a bit low, but I really didn\u0026rsquo;t want to spend any more money.\nAnd so, my tinkering journey began again.\nTech Choices First up, the OS. For this low-spec setup, the lightest choice is obvious: Alpine Linux.\nNext, how to install it. To stay compatible with WEPE , I used Ventoy as the main bootloader to install the system.\nServices are all deployed using Docker to keep the host system clean and make everything reproducible.\nServices I\u0026rsquo;m using:\nMedia: Emby Comics: Komga Music: Navidrome Audio Drama/Voice: Kikoeru Sharing: Samba Dashboard: Heimdall Services I considered but skipped:\nMedia: Jellyfin Comics/Novels: Kavita Cloud Mount: CloudDrive File Structure My usual style for service locations: each service gets its own folder under /home.\nAll HDDs are mounted under /mnt, which is pretty standard.\nI use mount \u0026ndash;bind to \u0026ldquo;bind\u0026rdquo; the actual files on the HDDs to the locations where the services expect them.\nSystem Installation Download Alpine Linux from the official site , put it on a Ventoy USB drive. Set the motherboard BIOS to boot from USB, select Alpine Linux from the Ventoy menu, and boot.\nAfter it finishes loading, log in as root (no password needed). Once logged in, run the install command:\n1 setup-alpine Just follow the prompts to complete the installation.\nOfficial docs: setup-alpine - Alpine Linux Public Key Login Edit the SSH config. First, create the .ssh folder.\n1 mkdir .ssh Go into the folder:\n1 cd .ssh Add your public key to authorized_keys.\n1 vi authorized_keys (Your public key is in %USERPROFILE%\\.ssh on Windows)\nEnable public key authentication in the SSH daemon config:\n1 vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config Around line 41, uncomment the line so it says:\n1 PubkeyAuthentication yes Enable Community Repository Open the repositories file:\n1 vi /etc/apk/repositories Remove the comment (#) from the community line:\n1 2 3 #/media/dm-0/apks http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.22/main http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.22/community Install Docker Update packages:\n1 apk update Install Docker:\n1 apk add docker docker-cli-compose Set it to start on boot:\n1 rc-update add docker default Start Docker:\n1 service docker start Check if it\u0026rsquo;s running:\n1 docker ps Add Swap The server image didn\u0026rsquo;t have swap by default, so I added it.

It lets me visit a specific domain (like emby.mynas) and have it point to my NAS.\nThe requirement is that your devices use the router as their DNS server. Then, in the router\u0026rsquo;s DHCP/DNS settings, give the NAS a static IP and add the custom domains, pointing them all to the NAS\u0026rsquo;s IP.\nNginx-UI To make the custom domains work, you need a reverse proxy. I use Nginx.\nDocker Compose file:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 version: \u0026#39;3.1\u0026#39; services: nginx-ui: image: uozi/nginx-ui:v2.2.0-patch.1 container_name: nginx_UI volumes: - /home/nginxUI/nginx:/etc/nginx - /home/nginxUI/nginx-ui:/etc/nginx-ui - /home/nginxUI/www:/www environment: - NGINX_UI_IGNORE_DOCKER_SOCKET=true ports: - 80:80 - 443:443 restart: always When a container needs to access another container, its bridge IP is 172.17.0.1.\nSo, if you have a service mapped to port 8888 on the host, the reverse proxy address isn\u0026rsquo;t 127.0.0.1:8888, it\u0026rsquo;s 172.17.0.1:8888.\n(See: 2025 New Server Setup Log#Installing-nginx-ui(Simplify Chinese) for why I set that environment variable).\nConclusion I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve finally achieved what I was talking about back in 2022.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also weird\u0026hellip; in just three years, even though I subjectively feel like I haven\u0026rsquo;t changed at all, when I read my old articles and remember my situation when I wrote them, I can truly feel that my way of thinking has changed, top to bottom.\nTo be honest, back then I was probably thinking of using a specialized system like True NAS. But I never would have imagined that when I finally did it, I would use a \u0026ldquo;from scratch\u0026rdquo; method that my past self wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have even dared to try. Looking back at my old posts, piecing this all together\u0026hellip; I can genuinely feel the \u0026ldquo;value\u0026rdquo; in it.\nThe tinkering never stops, and neither does the passion.\n","date":"2025-11-13T17:57:29+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/261/","title":"Your next NAS is not a NAS"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash Sound Vibes Series Song Title Translation Link 僕が死のうと思ったのは I Thought About Dying https://blog.yexca.net/archives/214 あくあ色ぱれっと Aqua Color Palette https://blog.yexca.net/archives/219 恋の押し売り Love Sales Pitch https://blog.yexca.net/archives/220 17さいのうた The 17-Year-Old\u0026rsquo;s Song https://blog.yexca.net/archives/224 drop Falling in Love https://blog.yexca.net/archives/230 生きるを選んだ私へ To Myself, Who Chose to Live https://blog.yexca.net/archives/239 rainy lady Uncleared Rain Vibes https://blog.yexca.net/archives/249 恋しくなったら手を叩こう If You Miss Love, Clap Your Hands https://blog.yexca.net/archives/250 pris-magic! Prism Magic! This Article Intro I grabbed Shigure Ui\u0026rsquo;s first physical album, \u0026ldquo;Mada Ame wa Yamanai,\u0026rdquo; a while back, but honestly, I mostly just had \u0026ldquo;rainy lady\u0026rdquo; on repeat. Then, last week, I stumbled upon the limited first-edition of her second album, \u0026ldquo;fiction,\u0026rdquo; and snagged it. While checking it out, I went back to \u0026ldquo;Mada Ame wa Yamanai\u0026rdquo; and realized I\u0026rsquo;d totally overlooked this gem of a track!\nInitially, after one listen, this song didn\u0026rsquo;t really click. But a couple of days ago, a melody just kept looping in my head. I figured it was Shigure Ui\u0026rsquo;s voice, but \u0026ldquo;fiction\u0026rdquo; wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite it. I found similar vibes but couldn\u0026rsquo;t pinpoint the exact track. So, I broadened my search, listened to this song, and boom—that familiar feeling hit.\nSpeaking of the song, its rhythm is pretty solid. But that sudden line, \u0026ldquo;Kimi wa watashi no taiyou\u0026rdquo; (You are my sun), instantly lifts your mood, especially when you\u0026rsquo;re feeling a bit down. Yuika\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Okusuri\u0026rdquo; kind of gives a similar vibe too, though it\u0026rsquo;s a tad more upbeat.\nWhen I was translating, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure how to tackle the title. Halfway through, the \u0026lsquo;color\u0026rsquo; theme just clicked. Also, \u0026ldquo;pris\u0026rdquo; made me think of both \u0026ldquo;prison\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;prism.\u0026rdquo; Given the context (and \u0026ldquo;prison magic\u0026rdquo; being a definite no-go), I went with the latter—it feels way cuter.\nFinally, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if Shigure Ui just digs rain, or if it\u0026rsquo;s for thematic consistency, but the whole album feels connected, right? \u0026ldquo;Mada Ame wa Yamanai\u0026rdquo; means \u0026ldquo;The Rain Hasn\u0026rsquo;t Stopped Yet.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;rainy lady\u0026rdquo; refers to herself as a \u0026ldquo;rainy season lady.\u0026rdquo; Then, \u0026ldquo;pris-magic!\u0026rdquo; features the lyric \u0026ldquo;Kimi wa watashi no taiyou\u0026rdquo; (You are my sun), shining on me.

So, let\u0026rsquo;s get to it.\nBut looking back, it\u0026rsquo;s already been three years since my last tinkering . Time really flies, huh?\nManga: Komga First up is Komga for reading manga. While scanning can be a bit sluggish, the overall user experience is decent.\nAfter all these years, Komga has seen many updates. My previous article is no longer reusable. Using docker-compose makes things more portable. Here\u0026rsquo;s the docker-compose.yml:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 version: \u0026#39;3.0\u0026#39; services: komga: image: gotson/komga:1.23.4 container_name: komga volumes: - type: bind source: /home/komga/config target: /config - type: bind source: /home/rclone/data target: /data ports: - 25600:25600 restart: unless-stopped Also, having a dedicated iOS app Komic is super convenient.\nrclone Mounts Google Drive Similar to Microsoft OneDrive , you first need to authenticate in a browser on a Windows machine to get a token.\nThe process is to download rclone, then run the command:\n1 rclone config After naming, select Google Drive (22), grant Full access all files, excluding Application Data Folder permission, then hit enter for the browser login to pop up. Once done, exit.\nInitially, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t entirely sure, so I applied for a software ID and Secret. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be used here, but I\u0026rsquo;ll keep a record in case it\u0026rsquo;s useful later.\nApplying for Google API ID and Secret Open the Google API Services website: https://console.developers.google.com/ Select Enable APIs and services, search for and enable Google Drive API.\nIn the Manage section of Google Drive API, Create credentials.\nFor API type, choose User data, which includes OAuth as described.\nIn OAuth Client ID, select Web application as the type. You can enter rclone for the name. After completion, a Client ID will appear.\nThen complete the creation. In Credentials, select the rclone app you just created and copy the Client secrets.\nNext, copy the config file to the server. The local directory is:\n1 C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Roaming\\rclone On the server, download fuse. My server is CentOS7, so I downloaded these:\n1 sudo yum install -y fuse fuse3 fuse-libs Newer systems can just download fuse3. Then mount it with Docker:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 sudo docker run --rm \\ --volume /home/opc/rclone/config:/config/rclone \\ --volume /home/opc/rclone/data:/data:shared \\ --volume /etc/passwd:/etc/passwd:ro --volume /etc/group:/etc/group:ro \\ --device /dev/fuse --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --security-opt apparmor:unconfined \\ rclone/rclone \\ mount GoogleDrive:/ /data \\ --no-checksum \\ --use-server-modtime \\ --no-gzip-encoding \\ --no-update-modtime \\ --no-seek \\ --modify-window 2m \\ --allow-other \\ --allow-non-empty \\ --dir-cache-time 30m \\ --cache-read-retries 15 \\ --cache-db-purge \\ --timeout 30m \\ --vfs-cache-mode full \\ --vfs-read-chunk-size 2M \\ --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 5M \\ --vfs-cache-max-age 30m \\ --attr-timeout 20s \\ --poll-interval 9m \\ --vfs-cache-poll-interval 10m\u0026amp; The long list of configurations afterwards refers to Komga\u0026rsquo;s official documentation . Their specific meanings are:\nParameter Purpose Explanation --no-checksum Skip checksums Reduces API calls and speeds up directory loading. Suitable for large files like videos. --use-server-modtime Use server\u0026rsquo;s file modification time Prevents duplicate uploads/syncs due to local vs. remote time differences. --no-gzip-encoding Disable GZIP encoding Some cloud services (like Drive) perform poorly with compressed responses; this reduces CPU usage. --no-update-modtime Do not update file modification time Prevents Drive from triggering version updates due to time changes for read-only purposes. --no-seek Disable random seeking Reduces support for video seeking, but improves stability for sequential reads. Suitable for continuous playback. --modify-window 2m File modification time error tolerance window Prevents misidentification due to local/remote time differences. --allow-other Allow other system users to access mounted content Requires explicit permission in /etc/fuse.conf. --allow-non-empty Mount non-empty directories Allows mounting even if the mount point is not empty. --dir-cache-time 30m Directory cache time Reduces frequent requests to cloud API, default is moderate. --cache-read-retries 15 Number of retries on cache read failure Improves stability. --cache-db-purge Purge cache database on each startup Prevents errors from corrupted old caches. Suitable for environments where mounts are frequently stopped/started. --timeout 30m Single transfer timeout limit Prevents disconnections when reading long videos or large files. --vfs-cache-mode full Full VFS cache mode Both reads and writes go through local cache. Most balanced and secure performance. --vfs-read-chunk-size 2M Chunk size for each download Smaller saves bandwidth but is more frequent. This config is suitable for low-bandwidth environments. --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 5M Maximum chunk size limit Limits growth to prevent timeouts from excessively large requests. --vfs-cache-max-age 30m Maximum cache file age Relatively short duration, good for saving space. --attr-timeout 20s File attribute cache time Prevents frequent stat() calls; 20s is a compromise. --poll-interval 9m Cloud change polling interval Checks for changes every 9 minutes, reducing Google API load. --vfs-cache-poll-interval 10m Local cache cleanup interval Cleans up expired cache every 10 minutes. Using Alpine Linux Due to high resource usage, I thought of using the extremely lightweight Alpine Linux.\nDocker Installation First, update packages:\n1 doas apk update Install Docker:\n1 doas apk add docker docker-cli-compose Configure startup on boot:\n1 rc-update add docker default Start Docker. This might take a moment:\n1 doas service docker start Add yourself to the Docker user group:\n1 doas addgroup ${USER} docker Reference articles:\nhttps://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Docker Swap Creation First, add swap space:\n1 doas fallocate -l 8G /swapfile Set permissions for root access only:\n1 doas chmod 600 /swapfile Format swap:\n1 doas mkswap /swapfile Enable swap:\n1 doas swapon /swapfile Then you can check if it\u0026rsquo;s active:\n1 free -h rclone Configuration Being extremely lightweight, it requires some additional configuration.\nFirst, install fuse:\n1 doas apk add fuse Load fuse module:\n1 doas modprobe fuse Then you need to change the root directory to a shared type:\n1 doas mount --make-rshared / After that, it\u0026rsquo;s similar to CentOS7.\nReference articles:\nHow to Install Rclone on Alpine Linux Latest Alpine Linux Wiki Rclone Kikoeru I hit a few dead ends at first and ultimately failed, so I\u0026rsquo;ll just log it here.\nAn Afternoon of Failure TT I followed forks of the classic kikoeru project to find the latest commit. While I did find XunJiJiang/kikoeru-express , I spent an entire afternoon trying to build the image, from Node.js 12 all the way to 16. I encountered various errors, tried different mirror sources, etc. Then I tried deploying it standalone, which also failed. Even attempting to build it without Docker failed. In the end, I really gave up and decided to stick with the classic 0.6.2.\nUgh, seriously. It recommended Node.js versions 12-14, but during actual build, at some step, it hinted at features from Node.js 16+. If I directly used 14+, npm i would error out. So I had to use version 13 to install dependencies first, then copy them over and build with version 16. Who knew this would take an entire afternoon? Honestly though, it did teach me to skillfully switch Node.js versions, haha.\nI opened an iOS app I had downloaded previously, tried connecting, and it showed an error. Checking the update log, it said to use version 0.6.14 or higher. I was shocked! Then I quickly searched and found Number178/kikoeru-express , which I had already starred 😂.\nNow using the updated Number178/kikoeru-express . The author also developed an iOS app, which is super convenient.\nConfiguration:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 version: \u0026#39;3.0\u0026#39; services: kikoeru: ports: - \u0026#39;8011:8888\u0026#39; container_name: kikoeru volumes: - type: bind source: /home/rclone/data/asmr target: /usr/src/kikoeru/VoiceWork - /home/kikoeru/sqlite:/usr/src/kikoeru/sqlite - /home/kikoeru/covers:/usr/src/kikoeru/covers - /home/kikoeru/config:/usr/src/kikoeru/config image: \u0026#39;number17/kikoeru:v0.6.14-20250914\u0026#39; restart: always Also, the tag language cannot be switched; it defaults to Simplified Chinese.

Renewed it last year, but this year, with all the deals popping up, renewing felt a bit pricey. After checking out some smaller server providers, I saw Alibaba Cloud offers discounts if you\u0026rsquo;ve been bill-free for 12 months. Since I was already looking at big names, Oracle popped into my head.\nFigured I\u0026rsquo;d give it a shot. Used all my real info, and it actually got approved directly. Sweet!\nBut then it hit me: the last time I tinkered with a server was back in 2023. Two years zipped by just like that. Time flies, huh?\nOracle Linux When creating the image, I found my preferred Debian wasn\u0026rsquo;t an option, so I decided to try Oracle Linux. Turns out, this thing comes with MySQL pre-installed (I\u0026rsquo;m a bit of a host minimalist with Docker, lol). Not only that, it takes up a ton of resources. For a free 1C1G instance, it just lagged out. Had to switch images.\nOracle Linux Usage Log First, an upgrade. Seeing the dnf command actually reminded me of my Fedora days.\n1 sudo dnf update -y Then I spotted MySQL in the upgrade list. Server was bogged down, so I planned to uninstall it. First, check MySQL service status.\n1 sudo systemctl status mysqld Service is running, so stop it first.\n1 sudo systemctl stop mysqld Disable autostart on boot.\n1 sudo systemctl disable mysqld Uninstall.\n1 sudo dnf remove mysql`server Even after that, software upgrades were still slow. For Docker installation, refer to: https://oracle-base.com/articles/linux/docker-install-docker-on-oracle-linux-ol8 CentOS7 Software Update First, change the repos. Oracle\u0026rsquo;s CentOS7 actually had a broken software list. Running sudo yum update threw an error:\n1 2 Could not retrieve mirrorlist http://mirrorlist.centos.org/?release=7\u0026amp;arch=x86_64\u0026amp;repo=os\u0026amp;infra=stock error was 14: curl#6 - \u0026#34;Could not resolve host: mirrorlist.centos.org; Unknown error\u0026#34; Update the software list.\n1 2 3 sed -i \u0026#39;s/mirror\\.centos\\.org/vault.centos.org/g\u0026#39; /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-*.repo sed -i \u0026#39;s/^#.*baseurl=http/baseurl=http/g\u0026#39; /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-*.repo sed -i \u0026#39;s/^mirrorlist=http/#mirrorlist=http/g\u0026#39; /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-*.repo Then, update the software.\n1 sudo yum update Reference: mirrorlist.centos.org no longer resolve?

First, check firewall status.\n1 sudo systemctl status firewalld Output Active: active (running) means it\u0026rsquo;s running. Check currently open ports (permanently open).\n1 sudo firewalld-cmd --list-all --permanent Add open port.\n1 sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8080/tcp --permanent Reload to take effect.\n1 sudo firewall-cmd --reload To remove a rule:\n1 sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --remove-port=8080/tcp --permanent Security Group Port Whitelisting Server-side port configuration handles system access, but you also need to whitelist inbound ports in the security group.\nNavigate to Instances - Networking - Subnet to manage the instance\u0026rsquo;s Subnet.\nManage specific security group lists under its Security tab.\nAdd Ingress Rules under its Security rules.\nFor Source Type, use CIDR. Enter 0.0.0.0/0 for Source CIDR. Use TCP for IP Protocol. Enter 80, 443 for Destination Port Range. Description is optional, enter HTTP/S.\nThen just \u0026lsquo;Add Ingress Rules\u0026rsquo;.\nInstall Nginx-UI While my previous article, Server Deployment Log with Docker , covered its specific use, new features have emerged with updates.\nTo allow other containers to control Nginx and for easier updates, new directories need to be mapped. So the docker-compose.yml now looks like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 version: \u0026#39;3.1\u0026#39; services: nginx-ui: restart: always image: uozi/nginx-ui:latest container_name: nginx_UI volumes: - /root/nginx/nginx:/etc/nginx - /root/nginx/nginx-ui:/etc/nginx-ui - /root/nginx/www:/www - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ports: - 80:80 - 443:443 The reason for mapping /var/run/docker.sock, as explained by Nginx-UI:\nNginx UI\u0026rsquo;s official image uses /var/run/docker.sock to communicate with the host Docker Engine via the Docker Client API. This feature is used to control Nginx in another container and to perform container replacement rather than binary replacement during Nginx UI\u0026rsquo;s OTA upgrade, ensuring container dependencies are also upgraded. If you don\u0026rsquo;t need this feature, add the environment variable NGINX_UI_IGNORE_DOCKER_SOCKET=true to the container.\nOther Services Looks like everything else I use can just continue as is. This migration felt super fast; most of the time was spent on server configuration itself.\n","date":"2025-10-03T10:22:25+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/257/","title":"2025 New Server Deployment Log"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash Intro Got some Record Tree JSON files from a senior dev. So I quickly coded up this thing to make life easier and jot down what I always forget. (Hey, fitting that this is article #256!)\nI even used it in PixivDownloader before, but completely blanked on it.\nReading JSON Files After reading, the returned value changes based on the JSON file structure. It\u0026rsquo;ll be either a Python list or a dictionary.\n1 2 3 4 import json with open(FILE_PATH, \u0026#34;r\u0026#34;, encoding=\u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34;) as f: jsonParse = json.load(f) Now you can mess with the jsonParse variable.\nLists If your JSON file looks like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 [ { \u0026#34;a\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;b\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;c\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;d\u0026#34; } ] Then, jsonParse will be an outer list, with each item inside being a dictionary.\nDictionaries If your JSON file looks like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 { \u0026#34;a\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;c\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;d\u0026#34; } } Then, jsonParse will be a two-level nested dictionary.\nOperations Once you know the type, you just treat it like any Python dictionary or list. For example, given this file:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 [ { \u0026#34;a\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;b\u0026#34;: 2 }, { \u0026#34;c\u0026#34;: 3, \u0026#34;d\u0026#34;: 4 } ] Code to print 1:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 import json with open(FILE_PATH, \u0026#34;r\u0026#34;, encoding=\u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34;) as f: s = json.load(f) print(s[0][\u0026#34;a\u0026#34;]) # Or print(s[0].get(\u0026#34;a\u0026#34;)) Code to change 4 to 100:\n1 2 3 4 5 import json with open(FILE_PATH, \u0026#34;r\u0026#34;, encoding=\u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34;) as f: s = json.load(f) s[1][\u0026#34;d\u0026#34;] = 100 Add an item to make the file look like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 [ { \u0026#34;a\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;b\u0026#34;: 2 }, { \u0026#34;c\u0026#34;: 3, \u0026#34;d\u0026#34;: 4 }, { \u0026#34;e\u0026#34;: 5 } ] Basically, just append a dictionary to the list. Here\u0026rsquo;s the code:\n1 2 3 4 5 import json with open(FILE_PATH, \u0026#34;r\u0026#34;, encoding=\u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34;) as f: s = json.load(f) s.append({\u0026#34;e\u0026#34;: 5}) Iteration For lists, use list iteration:\n1 2 for i in s: print(i) For dictionaries, use dictionary iteration:\n1 2 3 4 5 for key, value in s.items(): print(key, value) for key in s: print(key) Saving Use json.dump:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 with open(FILE_PATH, \u0026#34;r\u0026#34;, encoding=\u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34;) as f: s = json.load(f) # Make some changes to variable s with open(FILE_PATH, \u0026#34;w\u0026#34;, encoding=\u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34;) as f: json.dump(s, f, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2) ensure_ascii=False makes sure non-ASCII chars (like Chinese) are written correctly. indent=2 pretty-prints it with 2-space indents.\n","date":"2025-09-28T10:34:38+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/256/","title":"Python: Handling JSON Files"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash Alright, article #255!

Luckily, you can just add setup to your \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; tag, and it handles the return automatically. So, the above example becomes:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 \u0026lt;script setup\u0026gt; const msg = \u0026#39;hello vue3\u0026#39; const logMsg = () =\u0026gt; { console.log(msg) } \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Of course, it still returns under the hood; you just don\u0026rsquo;t have to write it out.\nReactive Data reactive The reactive() function takes an object and returns a reactive object.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 \u0026lt;script setup\u0026gt; import { reactive } from \u0026#39;vue\u0026#39; const state = reactive({ count: 100 }) const addCount = () =\u0026gt; { state.count++ } \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;{{ state.count }}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button @click=\u0026#34;addCount\u0026#34;\u0026gt;+1\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/template\u0026gt; ref ref() takes either a primitive or complex type and returns a reactive object. Under the hood, it wraps the original data in an object, making it a more complex type. Essentially, it uses reactive() internally for reactivity.\nBecause of this, you need to access the data via .value in \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; tags. But in \u0026lt;template\u0026gt;, you can use the variable directly. Here\u0026rsquo;s the previous example rewritten with ref():\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 \u0026lt;script setup\u0026gt; import { ref } from \u0026#39;vue\u0026#39; const c = ref(0) const addC = () =\u0026gt; { c.value++ } \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;{{ c }}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button @click=\u0026#34;addC\u0026#34;\u0026gt;+1\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/template\u0026gt; In real-world development, using only ref() often leads to more flexible and consistent code.\ncomputed Computed properties, using computed(), are similar to Vue 2, but now they\u0026rsquo;re just functions you can call anywhere.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 \u0026lt;script setup\u0026gt; import { computed, ref } from \u0026#39;vue\u0026#39; const list = ref([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]) const computedList = computed(() =\u0026gt; { return list.value.filter(item =\u0026gt; item \u0026gt; 2) }) \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;{{ list }}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;{{ computedList }}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/template\u0026gt; Properties created this way are read-only. If you need a writable computed property, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to explicitly declare get() and set(). Here\u0026rsquo;s an example from the official docs:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; const count = ref(1) const plusOne = computed({ get: () =\u0026gt; count.value + 1, set: (val) =\u0026gt; { count.value = val - 1 } }) plusOne.value = 1 console.log(count.value) // 0 \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Source: https://cn.vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core.html#computed watch The watch() function also tracks changes in one or more data sources, executing a callback when data changes. However, it now includes two additional parameters: immediate and deep.\nSingle Data Source 1 2 3 watch(count, (newValue, oldValue) =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#39;count changed\u0026#39;, oldValue, newValue) }) Multiple Data Sources 1 2 3 watch([count, name], ([newCount, newName], [oldCount. oldName]) =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#39;count or name has changed\u0026#39;, [newCount, newName], [oldCount. oldName]) }) Here\u0026rsquo;s an example. I\u0026rsquo;ve used simplified Pug here, but it should be easy enough to understand.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 \u0026lt;script setup\u0026gt; import { ref, watch } from \u0026#39;vue\u0026#39; const count = ref(0) const name = ref(\u0026#39;John\u0026#39;) const addCount = () =\u0026gt; count.value++ const changeName = () =\u0026gt; name.value = \u0026#39;Mike\u0026#39; // Watching a single data source watch(count, (newValue, oldValue) =\u0026gt;{ console.log(\u0026#39;count changed\u0026#39;, oldValue, newValue) }) // Watching multiple data sources watch([count, name], (newArr, oldArr) =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#39;count or name changed\u0026#39;, oldArr, newArr) }) \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;template lang=\u0026#34;pug\u0026#34;\u0026gt; div count: {{ count }} button(@click=\u0026#34;addCount\u0026#34;) +1 div name: {{ name }} button(@click=\u0026#34;changeName\u0026#34;) change name \u0026lt;/template\u0026gt; immediate immediate means it runs immediately. So, when the page loads, the watcher will trigger once.

Yet living like this every day has left me feeling empty and fatigued. This raised a question: in theory, I haven’t been doing anything energy-intensive, so why do I still feel so drained?\nThe Pomodoro Dilemma I remembered when I once suffered from eye strain. To protect my eyes, I started using the Pomodoro technique for studying. At first, my goal was clear: during breaks I would gaze into the distance or simply lie down and rest. It worked really well.\nBut as time went on, I wanted my breaks to feel more “entertaining.” I began using longer breaks to watch videos, listen to music, or play games. Gradually, my efficiency plummeted. I started feeling that using a timer was burdensome. Studying became tiring (sometimes I was deeply focused, but the timer forced me to stop), and even playing felt stressful. With only 20 minutes of playtime, I couldn’t relax at all—I just felt anxious.\nEntertainment: Another Form of Focus Thinking again, maybe entertainment isn’t actually relaxation. Entertainment, like studying, requires focus and mental energy. The whole idea of the Pomodoro technique is to manage periods of focus, then allow time for rest. That “rest” is meant to relax both mind and body, to recover from concentrated effort.\nWhen I deliberately emptied my mind and went for a walk, strolled in a park, or browsed a bookstore, I felt far more relaxed than watching videos or gaming. These activities consumed some physical energy, but compared to entertainment or study, they demanded much less mental energy.\nRedefining Entertainment and Relaxation From this, I realized my old definition of entertainment was flawed. Entertainment isn’t a way to restore myself after study—it’s another activity that requires mental effort. When I’m already low on mental energy, doing more of these things only drains me further. At that point, entertainment loses its meaning—like a phone running out of battery while you keep high-power apps running.\nRelaxation, on the other hand, should be redefined. It’s about opening up mind and body, drifting freely. When mental energy is lacking, doing something low in both mental and physical demand works better—tidying up, wandering aimlessly, doing things without purpose or intention.\nThe Blurred Line Between Study and Entertainment So if both study and entertainment require focus, what makes them different?\nI think it depends on interest. No matter how much concentration an activity needs, if you’re genuinely interested, it feels like entertainment; if not, it feels like study.\nFor example, with a game: if driven by interest, you just play for fun; if approached as “study,” it becomes about goals and achievements.\nOr with a movie franchise: with interest, you sit back and enjoy the spectacle; approached as study, you dissect details, explore lore, and analyze continuity.\nThe boundary is blurry. In most cases, it comes down to personal perception.\nRelaxation: True Recharge for Mental Energy Any activity with a specific goal still consumes mental focus—even some things we think of as relaxing, like grocery shopping, going to a bookstore, or even visiting a park.\nOnce there’s a purpose attached, it isn’t true relaxation, because the mind isn’t really at rest. The energy drained isn’t restored.\nRelaxation, then, can be seen as using light physical activity to compensate for mental fatigue. And if even the body feels too weak, then the best choice is simply to lie down.\nPerhaps real rest is not about finding an easy activity to do, but about allowing yourself to do nothing at all.\nConclusion Study helps us grow. Entertainment excites us. But true relaxation restores us.\nLife shouldn’t be only about chasing and stimulation. Maybe what we really need is not more entertainment, but the ability to pause.\n","date":"2025-08-22T22:17:38+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/253/","title":"Relaxation ≠ Entertainment: Rethinking Mental Energy"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by ChatGPT Introduction: The Drifting Sense of Learning In order to improve my English a little, I try to use it for things that aren’t too important, like games or daily apps. But every time I use it, I end up with a strange feeling of not having grasped anything—almost like drifting, as if I never truly experienced it at all.\nAfter thinking about it more deeply, I realized this might be the gap between translation and immersion. When Chinese, my native language, gets involved, the experience feels anchored and connected. But in a completely non-native environment, that connection disappears. Since I usually think in my mother tongue, I naturally overlook the thought process in a foreign language.\nAnalogy: The Controlled Sense of Execution From my actual experience, when I’m in a game that’s fully in English, I often feel like I don’t understand anything—even the simplest words. But if I play with friends and we communicate in Chinese, suddenly it feels different. It shifts back to a mode of translation, and instantly I feel lighter, moving from chaotic confusion to a small sense of control.\nThis reminds me of my life in Tokyo. Even when I speak Japanese in conversations, I often feel nothing inside—as if I’m just following a prewritten script rather than living. That’s even why I’ve grown fond of listening to Chinese songs: only then, while wandering around, do I feel like I’m still alive.\nParadox: Theoretical Optimum vs. Real Retreat But wait—this should actually be the ideal environment for language learning, right? A state fully detached from my native tongue. When I’m completely immersed in an English game, with no interference from Chinese, isn’t that the best possible scenario? After all, it’s similar to the idea of thinking in English.\nYet what I feel is quite the opposite. Facing an unfamiliar word, I instantly get the sense that I can’t do anything, that I know nothing. It triggers a kind of retreat, a withdrawal into doing nothing at all. In the end, I feel like my English hasn’t improved one bit—in fact, I’ve lost even more confidence.\nReflection: The Illusion of a Perfect Singularity Looking back at my learning experiences, I suddenly realized—it often doesn’t feel like learning at all. Instead, I rely on instinct and context. In games or daily life, there’s more than just language: there are actions, guides, and environmental cues. Maybe I’ve only been relying on those signals to decide my next move. That gives me the illusion of understanding the target language, but in truth, the language itself gets ignored. Which means I never really learned it.\nSo how have I been learning (not only languages) all along? It seems I’ve always been waiting for a perfect moment to dive in. Unless everything feels “perfect,” I convince myself that investing effort is meaningless. It’s that sense of: “The collecting never stops, but the learning never begins.”\nThis mindset shows up not only in my feelings, but also in my environment and materials. It’s like running a “breadth-first search” algorithm—at every stage, I want to achieve some kind of optimal state before moving forward. Otherwise, I consider the effort pointless. Even forcing myself to do it feels fruitless.\nLife: The Misalignment of Reason and Emotion This reminds me of life itself. When it comes to bothersome things—whether tasks or objects—our short-term and long-term perspectives can be completely different. In the short term, they trouble us; in the long term, they may not matter at all.\nTake an object, for example. In the long run, it might come in handy. But in the moment, it’s completely useless. Keeping it around for some imagined future utility leaves me stuck in discomfort. And in the end, sometimes it never even gets used.\nThe same misalignment happens with tidying up. Rationally, I know cleaning up will help. Emotionally, I don’t want to. Or I keep waiting for a “perfect moment” to start. The result? Until that imaginary moment comes, every reminder just brings irritation.\nConclusion: There Seems to Be No “Right Answer” So is there really an answer to efficient learning—or to efficient living?\nI think… there probably isn’t. Life is full of rational and emotional decisions. Maybe I plan to improve a certain skill during a certain period, but because the future is unpredictable—and feelings fluctuate—every attempt might turn out better or worse than expected.\nThat doesn’t mean there are no small tricks at all. Since new information can overturn old plans in an instant, maybe we can try constraining ourselves differently: give up one dimension, but compensate with another. Fix a certain time, and let quantity vary. Or fix a minimum quantity, and let time vary.\nExtension: Purpose and Freshness This brings me to another thought. Once something gains purpose, it often becomes harder to sustain emotionally. Even entertainment, like playing games, can turn heavy. If I play with the purpose of relieving stress, I can’t help but keep asking: “Am I actually relaxing?” That very awareness becomes a new pressure. Instead of relief, I might just get more exhausted—something like digital burnout.\nThat’s why people suggest: “It’s good to have more hobbies.” I think that makes sense. With different ways of relieving stress (as long as they’re genuinely interesting), you avoid relying too heavily on just one outlet.\nBut maybe the essence is simpler: it’s the sense of novelty. New things bring new energy.\nEpilogue: An “Uncontrollable” Future So what has this article really said? Honestly, I don’t know. Maybe it’s just the product of my confusion.\nBut perhaps that itself is the point—that accepting life’s uncontrollability is the truest way forward. I try to use reason to structure everything, but… no framework of reason can ever explain it all.\nJust like in “state-behavior theory,” you can only know the outcome with 100% certainty if you have all the variables. But how could we ever gather all the variables of life?\nMaybe the impossibility of grasping them is itself one of life’s variables.\n","date":"2025-08-18T18:27:12+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/252/","title":"Adrift in Learning, Misaligned in Life"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by ChatGPT Introduction A few days ago (2025-08-13), I had a dream. In it, the second film of a certain series was titled Phantom Dream, and my name appeared in the credits—though I didn’t know if I was the director or the screenwriter. The title itself wasn’t even original; it was just picked out from two short phrases used by the production studio, just like the first film. But the two films had no connection at all.\nIn the dream, I only saw the movie from the middle. There appeared images of binary-star entanglement, triple-star entanglement, a “second universe,” and then something like a singularity. That singularity triggered a big bang, the universe rebooted, life emerged, and a sprout broke through the soil. Then I woke up.\nAlthough in the dream it was said that this film was somehow related to The Three-Body Problem, from the part I saw, it didn’t feel connected at all. At the test screening I even felt like I might be recognized, and the promotion was boldly carried under the name of The Three-Body Problem. But I don’t think that really matters, so I’ll just skip over it.\nAnalysis I kept thinking about this dream. Binary- and triple-star entanglements are inherently unstable structures, representing contradiction and tension. The singularity and big bang symbolize the point where contradictions become irreconcilable, leading to an explosive conflict. After that, life appears, the sprout pushes through the soil—this is rebirth.\nSo, this whole sequence points to instability, or entanglement that cannot hold. Energy accumulates until it collapses into a singularity, then explodes, and new life begins.\nThoughts The film bore my name, but I didn’t know its contents. And while watching it in the dream, I even felt like I was the main character. To me, it seemed almost like a story about my own life—or about something I went through: various elements tangled together, unstable, and finally pushed by me into an explosion that led to both destruction and rebirth.\nAt the part with the triple-star entanglement, someone—maybe the audience, maybe the scrolling comments—said it was “the hardest frame.” Perhaps that meant the situation was already unstable, yet I still had to trigger it myself. It was a hard decision to make.\nRebirth At first, I thought the dream was hopeful, suggesting that something halfway through my life might turn around. But after more reflection, I realized nothing in my current life seems to be at such a turning point.\nLooking again, starting from the film’s title Phantom Dream, it seems to mean my recent experiences themselves were a “phantom dream.” Maybe I was the one who pierced it, bringing about a kind of rebirth.\nOr perhaps it means I inevitably escalate contradictions until they explode, but in the end, that destruction becomes my transformation.\nRealization I once built myself a rational decision-making system. My life felt like a rehearsal of choices—running through simulations of what might be “better.” During that time, I wasn’t really living; I was mechanically optimizing.\nAs the number of choices grew, I always viewed things from the widest possible range of possibilities. It looked reasonable, but as I realized, my life lost its own flavor. Just like Phantom Dream: I was the director, I was the protagonist, but I didn’t know the plot. I was just watching that movie—watching my life.\nLater, I began prioritizing my feelings, trying to consider what I actually liked. At first it felt refreshing. But gradually, I sank deeper into my emotions, and in doing so, lost my broad rational judgment. That, too, was Phantom Dream—a complete immersion in sentiment. Beautiful, maybe, but in the end just a dream.\nSo, against the unstable backdrop of lost rationality, I sought out a singularity—an end point—to force a psychological transformation and start anew.\nReflection I think this was my soul’s metamorphosis after living through almost purely rational and purely emotional modes. I realized extreme approaches don’t work. Life is inherently tangled; no single measure can define it.\nToo much rationality erases the small details of feeling, while too much emotion turns life chaotic. The balance is hard to hold. But isn’t life itself a kind of “phantom dream”? We are both the director and the protagonist—yet we never know the next scene.\nPostscript This essay itself is pretty chaotic. But isn’t that proof I’m analyzing while still inside the chaos, searching for my own singularity? And this time, the singularity is simply writing it down and publishing it. In that act, my blog breaks its silence and starts anew. 😂\n","date":"2025-08-17T01:13:32+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/251/","title":"Phantom Dream"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash Sound Vibes Series Song Title Translation Link 僕が死のうと思ったのは I Thought About Dying https://blog.yexca.net/archives/214 あくあ色ぱれっと Aqua-Colored Palette https://blog.yexca.net/archives/219 恋の押し売り Love Sales Pitch https://blog.yexca.net/archives/220 17さいのうた Song of 17 https://blog.yexca.net/archives/224 drop Falling in Love https://blog.yexca.net/archives/230 生きるを選んだ私へ To Myself Who Chose to Live https://blog.yexca.net/archives/239 rainy lady Rainy Lady https://blog.yexca.net/archives/249 恋しくなったら手を叩こう When You Miss Someone, Clap Your Hands This Article pris-magic!

Pris-magic! https://blog.yexca.net/archives/260 Introduction My thoughts on this song\u0026hellip; well, I already mentioned how I found it in a previous post: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/243/ . When I first heard it, especially that intro, it felt like it perfectly synced with my headspace at the time.\nOf course, I’m talking about those first few lines. With my Japanese level back then, I didn\u0026rsquo;t really grasp the rest (honestly, even the translation is a bit fuzzy to me). The overall vibe is one of powerlessness—that \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m so small\u0026rdquo; feeling. It\u0026rsquo;s like there are so many amazing people in the world, all shining bright, leaving me both envious and feeling a little pathetic.\nMaybe it\u0026rsquo;s because I usually listen to EDM (instrumental tracks), so I tend to project my own emotions onto songs now. Whenever I see a cute girl or meet someone really impressive in real life, the intro of this song often pops into my head. It’s a complex mix of admiration, longing, and a bit of regret for my own limitations.\nLooking closer at the lyrics later—putting aside the \u0026ldquo;romance\u0026rdquo; element—you can sense a certain uncertainty about the future. Though you can\u0026rsquo;t ignore the romance entirely, I’m not even sure what I’m writing here\u0026hellip; it’s just that feeling of \u0026ldquo;wanting to do what you love but being afraid to speak up.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s probably not just about dating.\n2025.05.26 Sang this song.

But it ended up saving me a ton of time without a single bug, and the more I used it, the smoother it felt.\nSlowly, it sparked that old thought: \u0026ldquo;Why not just use SQLite?\u0026rdquo; Seriously, spinning up a MySQL instance every time is a real pain. So, this version came to be, finally freeing me from firing up a database service every time. (And it\u0026rsquo;s finally actually usable by humans, too.)\nUsage Project Link: https://github.com/yexca/PixivDownloader-SQLite The GUI is similar to the previous generation; check out https://blog.yexca.net/archives/211/ for details.\nConfiguration Before use, you need to configure:\nrefresh token (for Pixiv login authentication, refer to: Pixiv OAuth Flow ) Download path (default D:\\Downloads) Download Instructions After setup, simply input:\nArtist ID, or Artwork ID (if both are provided, only the Artist ID will be used) Click \u0026lsquo;Download\u0026rsquo; to fetch all works and log them to the database. For artists without existing records, all works will be downloaded. For artists with records, only un-downloaded works will be fetched.\nError Handling Regarding program errors, only basic crawling error handling is implemented. If an error dialog pops up, it might be due to:\nrefresh token not configured or expired Artist account does not exist Artwork does not exist I haven\u0026rsquo;t provided specific error messages; if an error occurs, please check these three points.\nFor other errors (like the application crashing), please send me the latest file from program_root/logs/app_*-*-*.log and describe the issue.\nContact: PixivDownloader#yexca.net (replace @)\nNew Feature: From MySQL to SQLite The biggest change is no longer needing your own MySQL setup; it now uses lightweight SQLite.\nI then removed unnecessary database configs and consolidated settings with the Pixiv auth token.\nAdded an icon (just had ChatGPT draw one for fun), tweaked some UI styles – nothing major.\nThe code got some initial architectural structuring, though it ended up messy again by the end. (But who knows, maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll revisit it someday?)\nMigrating from Old MySQL Database While I doubt anyone used the previous version, I still need to explain this. Due to database structure differences, the best way to migrate is to query, export, and directly import. Here\u0026rsquo;s the query:\n1 2 3 SELECT ID, name, downloadedDate, lastDownloadID, url FROM pic WHERE platform = \u0026#39;pixiv\u0026#39;; Export the results in SQL INSERT format (I used Dataflare, which supports this).\nThen, create a Python file and put in the following content:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 import sqlite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(\u0026#34;pixiv.db\u0026#34;) cursor = conn.cursor() cursor.execute(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39; Create Table If Not Exists pic ( ID TEXT PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, downloadedDate TEXT, lastDownloadID TEXT, url TEXT ) \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39;) conn.commit() cursor.execute(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; INSERT INTO `pic` (`ID`, `name`, `downloadedDate`, `lastDownloadID`, `url`) VALUES (\u0026#39;123\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;name1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;2024-06-08 00:00:00\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;1234\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;https://www.pixiv.net/users/123\u0026#39;), (\u0026#39;234\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;name2\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;2025-02-12 00:05:36\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;2345\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;https://www.pixiv.net/users/234\u0026#39;), (\u0026#39;345\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;name3\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;2025-01-11 17:26:17\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;3456\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;https://www.pixiv.net/users/345\u0026#39;); \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; ) conn.commit() cursor.execute(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; Select * from pic \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; ) rows = cursor.fetchall() for row in rows: print(row) conn.close() Replace the content within cursor.execute with your database backup. I\u0026rsquo;ve left three example records here.\nThen, place the generated pixiv.db file into program_root/resources.\nSome Dev Thoughts: From \u0026lsquo;Messy Code\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;Understanding the Chaos\u0026rsquo; Honestly, when I started this dev cycle, I really wanted to refactor the previous messy code. But as I worked on it, I realized exactly why it got so messy in the first place 😂\nIf anything, this refactor ended up even messier. Halfway through, I just thought, \u0026ldquo;Forget refactoring, I\u0026rsquo;ll just copy-paste it.\u0026rdquo; That led to the current mix of camelCase and snake_case, and honestly, I\u0026rsquo;m too tired to touch it anymore, sigh.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s pretty much a runnable, half-finished product, but hey, if it works, it works, right?~\n","date":"2025-05-18T16:20:33+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/248/","title":"Pixiv Downloader Refactor: From Haphazard Code to Understanding the Chaos"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash Introduction Lately, while thinking about what to do or learn next, the word \u0026ldquo;DevOps\u0026rdquo; kept popping up. Initially, I did a quick search and found that I was familiar with most of the listed tech stack. I thought it was just about knowing more tools, similar to \u0026ldquo;full-stack\u0026rdquo; (which, in a way, it is). But I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too interested, so I put it aside (honestly, I just lacked development passion).\nUntil recently, after almost four months of taking it easy, I felt the need to get back into it. That\u0026rsquo;s when \u0026ldquo;DevOps\u0026rdquo; came to mind again. After looking into it further, what can I say\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s like extreme consolidation, right? We separated frontend and backend but kept the teams. Now it\u0026rsquo;s like separating dev and ops, but the same person does both.\nHowever, seeing GitHub Actions for automation reminded me of when my Jekyll blog could auto-deploy. But since I migrated from another blog system and kept my subfolder categorization habit, that deployment didn\u0026rsquo;t support subfolders, so I never looked into it deeply. Well, since I\u0026rsquo;m trying to get things done this time, let\u0026rsquo;s see if my current Hugo blog can be auto-deployed. After all, it\u0026rsquo;s a hassle to download from the container and re-upload every time.\nWorkflow A workflow is defined in a YAML file under the .github/workflows/ directory in your Git repository\u0026rsquo;s root. The filename can be anything; I\u0026rsquo;m doing a deploy, so I\u0026rsquo;ll use deploy.yml.\nThe file structure generally consists of a name, a trigger, and jobs.\nName This is straightforward, just give it a name.\n1 name: Build and Deploy Hugo Blog Trigger Action Workflows can be triggered in multiple ways. For me, triggering on every push is enough since I mostly just update articles and then build.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll also add a manual trigger, just in case a GitHub configuration error means the Action Workflow won\u0026rsquo;t start until the next push.\n1 2 3 4 5 on: push: # Trigger on Git Push branches: - main # Listen for updates on the source repository\u0026#39;s main branch workflow_dispatch: # Manual trigger Jobs I only have one job here; you can have multiple jobs that run in parallel.\nFirst, name the job.\n1 2 jobs: build-deploy: Then, define the runner; I chose Ubuntu.\n1 2 3 jobs: build-deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-latest Next, define the execution steps. The first step is to clone the repository.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 jobs: build-deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout source uses: actions/checkout@v4 Then, install Hugo.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 steps: - name: Setup Hugo uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2 with: hugo-version: \u0026#39;0.140.1\u0026#39; # This is my local version; higher compatibility extended: true # My theme uses SCSS, so the extended version is required Next, the build command.\n1 2 3 steps: - name: Build Hugo Site run: hugo --minify Push to my GitHub Pages deployment repository.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 steps: - name: Deploy to BlogWeb repo uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 with: external_repository: yexca/Blog-Web-Hugo publish_branch: main # Push to the main branch of the target repo yexca/Blog-Web-Hugo publish_dir: ./public # The folder to push from the current repo; Hugo defaults to this folder personal_token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_TOKEN }} So, putting it all together, it looks like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 name: Build and Deploy Hugo Blog on: push: branches: - main workflow_dispatch: jobs: build-deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout source uses: actions/checkout@v4 - name: Setup Hugo uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2 with: hugo-version: \u0026#39;0.140.1\u0026#39; extended: true - name: Build Hugo site run: hugo --minify - name: Deploy to blogWeb repo uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 with: external_repository: yexca/Blog-Web-Hugo publish_branch: main publish_dir: ./public personal_token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_TOKEN }} Configuring the Token Since accessing other repositories requires a Token, you need to generate one.\nGo to your Settings -\u0026gt; Developer Settings -\u0026gt; Personal access tokens -\u0026gt; Fine-grained tokens and generate a Token with read/write permissions for the specified repository.\nThen, configure it in your source repository. Mine is yexca/Blog-Source-Hugo. Go to the repository\u0026rsquo;s Settings -\u0026gt; Secrets and variables -\u0026gt; Actions and add the generated Token under Repository secrets. The name should be PERSONAL_TOKEN, as configured earlier.\nHandling Domain Issues If your GitHub Pages uses a custom domain, there\u0026rsquo;s a file named CNAME that contains your custom domain. When GitHub Actions Workflow pushes, it effectively deletes all previous content before pushing new content, so the CNAME file will also be deleted. You need to add this file before pushing to ensure your custom domain works. There are two methods:\nOne is to create the file within the workflow:\n1 2 3 steps: - name: Add CNAME run: echo \u0026#39;blog.yexca.net\u0026#39; \u0026gt; public/CNAME Or, simply place a CNAME file directly in Hugo\u0026rsquo;s static folder, as its contents will be copied directly to the generated content\u0026rsquo;s root directory.\nTheme Module Issues Because my original theme was added using Git Submodules, pushing it would directly link to the corresponding GitHub repo. However, I\u0026rsquo;ve made significant modifications that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be uploaded to GitHub. Therefore, I need to detach the link.\nBackup Theme Files Before doing anything, back up your theme by copying it to another folder.\n1 cp -r themes/Hugo-Theme-Stack tmp/Hugo-Theme-Stack-Backup Remove Submodule Configuration First, deinitialize the submodule.\n1 git submodule deinit -f themes/Hugo-Theme-Stack Remove it from Git.\n1 git rm -f themes/Hugo-Theme-Stack Remove the files.\n1 rm -rf .git/modules/themes/Hugo-Theme-Stack Also, delete the .gitmodules file in the root directory.\n1 rm .gitmodules Restore Theme Now, move the backed-up files back.\n1 cp -r tmp/Hugo-Theme-Stack-Backup themes/Hugo-Theme-Stack Delete the backup files (you can test first before deleting).\n1 rm -rf tmp Fixing JS Specification Errors My previous blog\u0026rsquo;s runtime used an older octal number syntax, and since I used the hugo --minify command to build and compress, it led to errors.\nThe fix was quite simple. The original code was:\n1 Date.UTC(2021, 10, 06, 14, 15, 19) Changed to:\n1 Date.UTC(2021, 10, 6, 14, 15, 19) Conclusion Finally, I\u0026rsquo;m free from local compilation. Ever since I started using Docker, I gradually got used to isolating my development environment from my local system. This way, if I change systems or servers, I just transfer the container. So development has always been isolated from the physical machine, and I\u0026rsquo;ve slowly developed an \u0026ldquo;environment hygiene\u0026rdquo; habit.\nNow it\u0026rsquo;s even better: building and deploying aren\u0026rsquo;t even local anymore. Before, it was isolated to containers; now, it\u0026rsquo;s isolated to the cloud. My environment hygiene habit is completely cured, I guess.\nBut looking at DevOps again, I feel like it\u0026rsquo;s a product of today\u0026rsquo;s increasingly competitive landscape and ever-convenient technological advancements.\nFrom early machine adaptation and assembly to the advent of high-level languages, then containerized deployment breaking environmental barriers—each technological iteration brings improved efficiency and lowers the barrier to entry, while subtly raising the \u0026ldquo;starting line.\u0026rdquo;\nWhile it brings greater convenience to programming life, it also quietly raises the industry\u0026rsquo;s entry bar, making me obsolete faster, I guess.\nHowever, work is work, and life is life. Technology iterates fast, but world systems and industries don\u0026rsquo;t change that quickly. There should still be some breathing room for us.\n","date":"2025-05-16T18:14:06+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/247/","title":"Embracing DevOps: Offloading My Blog Build and Deploy to GitHub"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash Introduction Another self-introduction, and my blog popped into my mind again.\nI used to just Google yexca, click the first result, and land on my blog. But ever since changing domains, I\u0026rsquo;ve searched for yexca countless times, and my blog just vanishes from the results.\nInitially, I didn\u0026rsquo;t worry much, thinking maybe there was some penalty. Google recommends a year of 301 redirects after a domain change, but I only did six months before the old domain expired.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s been two years now, right? It should have recovered by now.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s crazier is that some old, unmaintained sites rank higher. Meanwhile, my blog, which I update, optimize, and tinker with daily, seems completely forgotten by the world.\nSo, I Started Looking for Answers Opened my blog, checked the \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; section. Huh? Why is \u0026lt;meta name='description'\u0026gt; just that tagline on the left side of the page?\nAh, when I configured it, it just said it would appear there. I thought it was similar to Argon\u0026rsquo;s setup. So, this site\u0026rsquo;s description is essentially meaningless.\nBut that phrase has been with me through my entire blogging journey; I don\u0026rsquo;t want to give it up easily. Alright, then let\u0026rsquo;s use JSON-LD for structured data!\nSo, I added this to the theme\u0026rsquo;s custom \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; section:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 \u0026lt;script type=\u0026#34;application/ld+json\u0026#34;\u0026gt; { \u0026#34;@context\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://schema.org\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;@type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Blog\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;yexca\u0026#39;Blog\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;{{ .Site.BaseURL }}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;inLanguage\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;{{ .Site.Language.Lang }}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;{{ .Site.Params.description }}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;author\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;@type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Person\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;yexca\u0026#34; } } \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Yeah, also considering it\u0026rsquo;s a multilingual site, using variables for some content is definitely better.\nNavigating the Language Maze Speaking of multilingual sites, what if I search in a different language environment? So I searched yexca on google.com.hk, google.com.tw, and google.com.jp.\nTurns out, my blog shows up in Japanese search results, but not in Chinese. As for English, I don\u0026rsquo;t have many articles, so it\u0026rsquo;s whatever.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s really weird. Google should be able to identify https://blog.yexca.net as yexca, but why are the other language versions doing so poorly?\nDigging deeper, I realized hreflang configuration might be missing, so I added:\n1 2 3 4 5 \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;alternate\u0026#34; hreflang=\u0026#34;x-default\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;https://blog.yexca.net/\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;alternate\u0026#34; hreflang=\u0026#34;zh-CN\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;https://blog.yexca.net/\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;alternate\u0026#34; hreflang=\u0026#34;zh-TW\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;https://blog.yexca.net/zh-tw/\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;alternate\u0026#34; hreflang=\u0026#34;ja\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;https://blog.yexca.net/ja/\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;alternate\u0026#34; hreflang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;https://blog.yexca.net/en/\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; This explicitly tells search engines that users of different languages can access different language versions, and it\u0026rsquo;s all the same website.\nBTW, this \u0026lt;link\u0026gt; block also appears on article pages because there\u0026rsquo;s no conditional logic.

Some swipe cards like designers, and design systems like they live life.\n1. Introduction: What is a Card Enthusiast? Let’s start with something I once saw online—the seven favorite hobbies of card enthusiasts:\nNote: “Mainland China” here refers to regions where capital inflow and outflow are restricted.\nFinding ways to spend foreign currency in China Finding ways to spend RMB abroad Finding ways to move RMB out of the country Finding ways to bring foreign currency in Applying for cards that are useless in China Applying for cards that are even more useless abroad Trying to move around money that doesn’t even reach the length of a typical PIN code, across a bunch of nearly useless cards Note: In mainland China, bank PINs are usually 6 digits. This is a self-deprecating joke meaning “my balance doesn’t even reach 6 digits, but I’m still shuffling it like it matters.” May not apply elsewhere.\nIt may sound like a financial game—applying for cards, chasing cashback, reducing fees, optimizing exchanges\u0026hellip; Seems like a bunch of petty tricks.\nBut for true card enthusiasts:\nIt’s not about saving a few bucks—it\u0026rsquo;s about designing an optimal, multi-channel, multi-constraint capital flow system.\nThey’re not milking the system. They’re exploring the architecture of reality, optimizing the structure of everyday life.\n2. What Does a System Architect Actually Do? To become a certified system architect, you need to learn all kinds of jargon—modular decoupling, performance optimization, API specification, and more. But beyond the terms, the real job is simple:\nFaced with complex constraints, allocate resources, design routes, and connect systems to build something stable yet flexible.\nA system architect isn’t just writing beautiful code or drawing diagrams. Their main concern is: will the system work in real-world chaos? For example:\nHow should modules divide responsibilities? How should services interact? How can interfaces be defined for future expansion? How do we locate issues and isolate failures? How do we balance performance and cost under limited resources? Their role is part LEGO builder, part road engineer, part system patcher. Not given a perfect blueprint from the start, they piece things together step-by-step in a broken and messy world.\nIn short, they design systems that run steadily, adapt quickly, and are affordable to maintain. They don’t chase technical perfection—they chase what works. That’s the beauty of system architecture.\nI only learned these things for an exam, but through that process, I rediscovered my passion for card optimization.\n3. The “Architecture Problems” of Card Enthusiasts Card optimization isn’t just “saving a little money.” And system architecture isn’t just “high-end tech design.” Despite different contexts, they both tackle the same core challenge:\nNavigating constraints, managing costs, and designing optimal structures in an uncertain world.\nCard enthusiasts don’t just apply for cards—they design capital flows.\nSystem architects don’t just code—they design control and data flows.\nCard people ask: how do I reduce fees, avoid risk flags, and ensure smooth transactions?\nArchitects ask: how do I reduce failures, scale up, and maintain stability?\nI originally studied architecture for the test, but looking back—it’s the same thinking I used when optimizing my card flows.\nCard World Architecture World Core Logic Fees Latency / Performance Cost Management Channel Limits API Call Restrictions Protocol Compatibility Card Regulations Module Specifications Compliance FX Disparities Cross-platform Overhead Environment Adaptation Card Diversity Tech Stack Diversity Module Integration Bank Risk Controls Security Strategies Risk Management Flow Paths Data Routing Architectural Routing Card optimization isn’t exploiting loopholes—it’s designing capital flow architectures.\nThey aren’t “doing things.” They’re building structures: not just finding the best cashback card, but designing a path that moves funds with minimal cost and maximum efficiency.\nThey don’t just ask “can it be done,” but “is it elegant.”\nCard optimization is solving a constrained shortest-path problem, just like service topology design is about optimizing module coupling under SLA limits.\nThe difference between them? Just different application domains.\n4. System Practice Through Personal Exploration Others chase cashback. I’m studying the ecosystem.\nEvery card enthusiast’s path is unique. We each deal with different banks, currencies, and lifestyles.\nThe fun doesn’t lie in copying others—but in finding your own optimal flow through trial and error, grounded in real context.\nI started off just trying to save a little on fees. But after digging through endless documentation, I realized: every bank had its own transfer policies, time windows, restrictions. Some offered free morning transfers, others were fast but limited to specific currencies. Some would randomly block transfers. It felt like a fog-of-war map—I had to explore, unlock nodes, and build routes.\nAfter countless small tests, I built a working, cost-effective flow tailored to myself. I avoided high-fee routes, optimized timing, and even exploited currency fluctuations for marginal gains.\nSome goals seemed impossible at first—like sending funds to countries with little infrastructure. But I eventually figured out how: crypto deposits, direct virtual currency payments, fiat-to-stablecoin automation, specialized remittance apps bypassing banks\u0026hellip; I made the impossible possible.\nThis transition—from “unreachable” to “path unlocked”—felt exactly like rebuilding a network architecture.\nI wasn’t just transferring money. I was redefining the structure of value transmission.\nSounds complex? It’s really just a classic systems design problem:\nHow do systems communicate and transfer data? How do we handle format (currency) conversions? Which nodes are reliable? Which paths are low-latency and low-failure? How do we move a “data packet” (money) through protocols (remittance channels) to the destination? Can it feel seamless from the user’s (my) perspective? That’s architecture: not feature-building, but designing a coherent, maintainable, scalable system.\nEach card is a node; each interface is a protocol. Every iteration? A tiny architectural optimization.\nIt’s route planning + interface negotiation + user experience. Sounds familiar, architect?\nCard enthusiasts aren’t just saving money. They’re reconstructing the world’s financial logic and taking control.\n5. Architectural Literacy Forged Through Card Craft Through every route choice, failed experiment, cost balancing act, and risk-management adjustment, card enthusiasts are honing a kind of architectural mindset. No servers, no code—but plenty of real-world structure tuning and efficiency refinement. That process? It\u0026rsquo;s hands-on system design.\nAll these behaviors, over time, naturally evolve into core architectural instincts:\nCapability Real-World Manifestation Architectural Principle Rule Familiarity Mastering bank limits and terms Documentation Literacy Integration Coordinating multi-card workflows System Integration Thinking Cost Awareness Minimizing transaction fees Performance/Cost Tradeoff Modeling Mapping optimal card flow paths Structural Modeling Risk Management Multi-account, failover logic High Availability Design Aesthetic Sense Making money “move elegantly” Engineering Beauty In many ways, card enthusiasts are simulating what it means to think like a systems architect—using the real world as their playground.\n6. My Reflection Fees are the enemy. Channels are sacred. Paths are art.\nI didn’t become a card enthusiast because I love swiping cards—I became one because through each experiment, I found beauty in structure. We may not write code or run servers, but every money transfer, every optimized flow—it’s all a personal exercise in system design.\nFrom prepping for the architecture certification to building my daily financial routes, I’ve come to realize:\nWhat I enjoy isn’t just getting things done—it’s making the path elegant.\nWhat others see as petty tricks, I see as system aesthetics.\nWhat others call loophole hunters, I call life architects.\nCardcraft isn’t just about saving money—it’s a real-world sandbox to train your sense of system design: visualizing problems, iterating solutions, aligning logic with beauty.\nIt’s not a waste of time. It’s a tactile, tangible, deeply personal “practice space” for designing real-world systems.\nIt’s not about saving money. It’s about skill-building.\nIt’s not about invention. It’s about choosing the right structure.\nWhether it’s designing systems or optimizing card flows, the point isn’t how much you saved or how many lines you wrote—it’s how much better you understand how the world works.\nAnd I? I’m the kind of person who stands in front of an ATM for 10 minutes—just to calculate the optimal fee path. Maybe I don’t have a server to deploy, but I’m still architecting.\nConclusion: Life Is the Ultimate Architecture Every time we swipe a card, transfer money, evaluate a route, or make a combination decision—we\u0026rsquo;re engaging in an invisible act of system design.\nArchitecture isn\u0026rsquo;t just about servers and APIs. Sometimes, it\u0026rsquo;s hidden between wallets, bank cards, and payment methods.\nAt the end of the card optimization path, perhaps what we find is not a loophole hunter—\n—but a life architect in disguise.\nAppendix: My Capital Flow in Code This code isn’t meant to be executable—it’s a model of how I think about my real-world money flows. It’s how I express everyday logistics through architectural language.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 // My cross-border capital flow (illustrative) func RouteCNYtoJPY(CNY float64) JPY float64 { HKD := BOCExchange(CNY, to=\u0026#34;HKD\u0026#34;) log.Printf(\u0026#34;Exchanged %.2f CNY to %.2f HKD\u0026#34;, CNY, HKD) Transfer(HKD, from=\u0026#34;BOC\u0026#34;, to=\u0026#34;BOCHK\u0026#34;, by=\u0026#34;pbservice\u0026#34;) log.Println(\u0026#34;Transferred via pbservice → BOCHK\u0026#34;) Transfer(HKD, from=\u0026#34;BOCHK\u0026#34;, to=\u0026#34;Wise\u0026#34;, by=\u0026#34;fpservice\u0026#34;) log.Println(\u0026#34;Transferred via fps → Wise\u0026#34;) JPY := WiseConvert(HKD, to=\u0026#34;JPY\u0026#34;) log.Printf(\u0026#34;Converted %.2f HKD to %.2f JPY via Wise\u0026#34;, HKD, JPY) Deposit(JPY, to=\u0026#34;Revolut\u0026#34;, with=\u0026#34;ApplePay\u0026#34;) return JPY } A code snippet built not for execution, but for expression—a symbolic blueprint connecting everyday money logic to architectural thinking.\nDisclaimer: This article is for entertainment and personal documentation purposes only.

I stopped in April 2025.\nMy last entry: ¥0\nThe Beginning: To Save Money and Gain Control It all started very simply — I wanted to control my spending and build better financial awareness. And in the beginning, it really worked. I successfully curbed some of my bad spending habits.\nThe Process: Stepping Into the World of Optimization and Card Collecting Gradually, in pursuit of “better” consumption, I started comparing everything, looking for the optimal choice. At first, it was just comparing product prices. Later, it expanded to payment methods, tools, and eventually to bank promotions and card applications.\nI applied for cards for discounts, then for convenience, and eventually just for collecting them. Step by step, I had fallen deep into the card-collecting world.\nWhat started as saving money, turned into convenience, and ended up becoming card collecting.\nThe Backfire: When Accounting Became a Burden And so, accounting itself slowly became a burden. More and more accounts, more and more complex scenarios — the time cost and mental cost of bookkeeping had long exceeded its actual benefits.\nThere were times I spent hours researching just to save a few bucks. At first, that felt fun. But after doing it over and over, finding the optimal solution no longer excited me — it just left me feeling empty.\nThe Change: From Seeking The Best to Seeking Comfort Maybe I’ve changed. My approach to consumption has changed too.\nFrom “maximize savings” to “close enough, as long as I’m comfortable.”\nI realized I had already broken through my original spending limits, yet I didn’t lose control. On the contrary, I came to understand more deeply: compared to saving money, my time and my happiness mattered more.\nThe Reflection: Why Am I Even Keeping Accounts? Because of bookkeeping, I started to:\nConstantly dig through records because I had too many accounts Create new accounts in the app frequently due to currency conversions Spend a long time hesitating over whether I should buy something Have my mood ruined during outings with friends over spending details That made me reflect — Why am I even doing this?\nIs it really worth it for the so-called “gains” from bookkeeping?\nThe Decision: Letting Go, Reset, Move On So I tried to let go, to not fuss over the details, and simply asked myself:\n“Am I happy?”\nAnd the result was — yes, I was really happy. And my spending wasn’t as high as I imagined either.\nPerhaps my habits had already trained me to naturally compare prices. Or maybe, emotional value is something that can never be measured by discounts.\nTherefore, I think it’s time to let go.\nAccounting has fulfilled its mission.\nIt’s no longer a tool, but a shackle.\nHabits are meant to improve life.\nIf they can no longer be sustained by passion, and instead get in the way of living, then it’s time to learn to say goodbye.\nThe Ending: Thank You, and Keep Living Giving up a habit I’ve maintained for two years is indeed a little bittersweet.\nBut maybe this is also a part of life. Nothing stays with us forever, but as long as the time spent together was beautiful, that’s enough.\nPerhaps I’ve lost a symbolic tool that made me feel like “I’m good at saving money.”\nBut more than that, I hope my future self won’t rely on numbers and records for a sense of security, but instead, live with true ease and freedom.\nFrom being in control, to flowing into the unknown.\nI hope I can adapt soon.\nAnd I hope I can spend the saved time on things that are more meaningful and more joyful.\nThe Last Entry, ¥0 Leaving a short note here.\nThank you to myself for two years of dedicated tracking.\nFrom now on, I hope to spend the saved time on things that are more meaningful and joyful.\nAnd just like that, I archived this experience.\nRecording ends, but life is only just beginning.\n","date":"2025-04-14T16:23:48+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/244/","title":"From Saving Money, To Living Life, To Saying Goodbye"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash My blog started getting super dry and dull after I began posting more specialized learning content. Seriously, opening it just screamed \u0026lsquo;study time,\u0026rsquo; which built up this mental block against writing. I\u0026rsquo;ve wanted to post other stuff for ages but never got around to it. Well, thanks to some recent events, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna give a non-tech post a shot.\n「まだ雨はやまない」 On 2025-03-23, I grabbed my first physical album: Shigure Ui\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;まだ雨はやまない\u0026rsquo;. The album art, like a photo album, is just too cute!\nBut the purchase journey itself was a bit convoluted. I\u0026rsquo;ve bought too many things that looked cool at first glance but ended up being disappointing. Plus, budget constraints mean I always have to weigh decisions when buying non-essentials. So, getting an album from an artist I barely knew was definitely a risky move (it wasn\u0026rsquo;t cheap, doge).\nI first spotted this album in a physical store back in January (2025). Thought, \u0026rsquo;that\u0026rsquo;s adorable,\u0026rsquo; and the seed to buy it was planted. I also learned about Shigure Ui. Then, on March 22nd, at an exhibition in Okinawa held on VRChat, I saw that Shigure Ui designed Hatsune Miku\u0026rsquo;s image for the event. Felt instantly familiar (and caught the March 23rd livestream).\n初音ミクのライブを見た、可愛かった！\nI watched Hatsune Miku\u0026#39;s live concert, so cute!\n也是看上初音未来的直播了 pic.twitter.com/r1JeMpQ9UA\n\u0026mdash; yexca (@yexcano) March 24, 2025 That got me thinking about the album again. That day, I looked her up, listened to a few tracks, and thought they were pretty good. But when I went to buy it on the 23rd, and actually got to the store, I hesitated. Once I had the album in hand, I started checking it out (I was super torn; usually if I\u0026rsquo;m buying something, I don\u0026rsquo;t research it beforehand – I want the surprise. If I research, I usually don\u0026rsquo;t buy). But I guess I still had that buying urge. I just looked at the tracklist, and since only one song seemed familiar, I popped into the manga store next door, grabbed a comic, and headed home. On the subway, I reflexively opened my music app. Suddenly, a song hit differently – it was amazing! I instinctively hit \u0026lsquo;favorite,\u0026rsquo; but then saw the title and realized, \u0026lsquo;Wait, that\u0026rsquo;s from that album!\u0026rsquo; I immediately U-turned, rushed back to the store, and snagged the album. (Rainy Lady is just that good!)\nRipping the Tracks Honestly, I don\u0026rsquo;t really need to listen to physical albums. So, that leads to the main point of this post: getting the tracks off the album. I mainly followed this guide: https://www.bilibili.com/opus/925630344961458181 I initially planned to just write about my own process, as usual. But some new stuff came up, so I\u0026rsquo;ll just link to it.\n「アルストロメリア」 Yesterday (25th), my plans to game with a friend got pushed because they wanted to go out. So, I figured, why not go out too? And just like that, I stumbled upon Kano\u0026rsquo;s album!!!\nI grabbed it on the spot! My excitement was off the charts. My meager writing skills can\u0026rsquo;t even begin to express how thrilled I was. I\u0026rsquo;m super familiar with Kano, so no ripping needed for these tracks. Opening the album, heart pounding, and seeing that final smile? My soul was completely healed. What an awesome experience. Seriously, buying stuff you love is always a good move!\nIn this moment, only one phrase came to mind: \u0026lsquo;このような幸せ、あるでしょうか\u0026rsquo; (Could there be any happiness like this in the world?)\nWrap-up Honestly, writing this out, I can totally tell my content\u0026rsquo;s a bit thin and my expression isn\u0026rsquo;t top-notch. But whatever, getting super strict is just like writing rigorous technical articles, right? Sometimes, it\u0026rsquo;s cool to just chill and ramble a bit.\n","date":"2025-03-26T18:18:31+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/243/","title":"Curating My Music, Preserving My Vibes"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash These notes were likely written around the same time as previous ones. Since the file creation time is past the exam date, it might have been created during a file move.\nThe Role of Operating Systems A computer system consists of two parts: hardware and software. A computer without any software is often called \u0026ldquo;bare metal.\u0026rdquo; Using bare metal directly is not only inconvenient but also significantly reduces work efficiency and machine utilization. The Operating System (OS) aims to bridge the gap between humans and machines, creating an interface between the user and the computer. It\u0026rsquo;s a type of system software configured for bare metal.\nThe OS\u0026rsquo;s position in a computer system is illustrated below:\nAs shown in the diagram, the OS is the first layer of software on bare metal, extending the hardware\u0026rsquo;s functionality for the first time. It holds a crucial and special position in a computer system. All other software, such as editors, assemblers, compilers, database management systems, and a wide array of application software, are built upon the OS, relying on its support and services.\nFrom a user\u0026rsquo;s perspective, once a computer has an OS, users no longer directly interact with the hardware. Instead, they use the commands and services provided by the OS to operate the computer. The OS has become an indispensable and the most important system software in modern computer systems, thus serving as the interface between the user and the computer.\nProcess Management Process management is also known as processor management. In multi-program batch processing systems and time-sharing systems, multiple programs execute concurrently. To describe the dynamic changes during program execution in such systems, the concept of a process was introduced. A process is the basic unit for resource allocation and independent execution. Process management primarily focuses on studying the concurrent characteristics of various processes, as well as issues arising from inter-process cooperation and resource contention.\nCharacteristics of Sequential Program Execution A precedence graph is a directed acyclic graph composed of nodes and directed edges. Nodes represent operations of different program segments, while directed edges between nodes indicate a precedence relationship. The precedence relationship between program segments Pi and Pj is denoted as Pi→Pj, where Pi is the predecessor of Pj, and Pj is the successor of Pi. This means Pj can only execute after Pi has finished.\nThe image below shows a precedence graph with 3 nodes. Input is a predecessor to calculation; calculation can only proceed after input is complete. Calculation is a predecessor to output; output can only proceed after calculation is complete.\nKey characteristics of sequential program execution include sequentiality, closedness, and reproducibility.\nCharacteristics of Concurrent Program Execution If multi-programming techniques are used in a computer system, multiple programs in main memory can be in a concurrent execution state. For the job type with 3 program segments mentioned above, although program segments with precedence relationships within the same job cannot execute in parallel on the CPU and I/O components, program segments within the same job that lack precedence relationships, or program segments from different jobs, can execute in parallel on the CPU and various I/O components. For instance, in a system with one CPU, one input device, and one output device, the precedence graph is as follows:\nThe characteristics of concurrent program execution are:\nLoss of program closedness. No longer a one-to-one correspondence between program and machine execution activities. Mutual constraints between concurrent programs. Process States and Transitions In a multi-program system, processes run alternately on the processor, and their states continuously change. Thus, processes generally have 3 basic states: running, ready, and blocked.\nRunning. When a program is executing on the processor, the process is said to be in a running state. Obviously, for a single-processor system, there is only one process in the running state. Ready. A process that has acquired all necessary resources except the processor, and can run as soon as it gets the processor, is said to be in a ready state. Blocked. Also called the waiting or sleeping state. A process temporarily stops execution while waiting for a specific event to occur (e.g., waiting for I/O completion after an I/O request). In this state, even if the processor is allocated to the process, it cannot run. Hence, it\u0026rsquo;s called a blocked state. Process State CPU Resources Running √ √ Ready × √ Blocked × × Five-State Model In reality, for an actual system, process states and their transitions are more complex. For example, introducing \u0026ldquo;New\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Terminated\u0026rdquo; states forms the five-state process model.\nInter-Process Communication In a multi-program environment, with multiple processes that can execute concurrently, issues of resource sharing and mutual cooperation between processes inevitably arise. Inter-process communication (IPC) refers to the process by which various processes exchange information.\nSynchronization vs. Mutual Exclusion: Synchronization deals with direct constraints between cooperating processes, while mutual exclusion deals with indirect constraints between processes contending for critical resources.\nProcess Synchronization In a computer system, multiple processes can execute concurrently, each advancing at its own independent, unpredictable speed. However, they need to coordinate their work at certain specific points when cooperating. For instance, if Process A is putting data into a buffer, Process B must wait until Process A\u0026rsquo;s operation is complete.\nThus, process synchronization refers to the coordination required among processes that need to cooperate and work together within the system.\nProcess Mutual Exclusion Process mutual exclusion refers to multiple processes in the system executing exclusively due to contention for a critical resource. In a multi-program environment, processes can share various resources. However, some resources can only be used by one process at a time. These are called Critical Resources (CR), such as printers, shared variables, and tables.\nPrinciples of Critical Section Management A Critical Section (CS) is the part of a process\u0026rsquo;s code that operates on a critical resource. The four principles for managing mutually exclusive critical sections are:\nEnter if Empty. If no process is currently in the critical section, a process is allowed to enter it, and it should run for only a finite time within the critical section. Exclusive Access. If a process is in the critical section, other processes attempting to enter must wait, ensuring mutually exclusive access to the critical resource. Bounded Waiting. For processes requesting access to a critical resource, it should be guaranteed that the process can enter the critical section within a finite amount of time, preventing \u0026ldquo;starvation.\u0026rdquo; Yield Processor if Waiting. When a process cannot enter its critical section, it should immediately release the processor (CPU) to avoid busy-waiting. Semaphore Mechanism The semaphore mechanism, proposed by Dutch scholar Dijkstra in 1965, is an effective tool for process synchronization and mutual exclusion. Currently, semaphore mechanisms have evolved significantly, mainly including integer semaphores, record semaphores, and semaphore set mechanisms.\nInteger Semaphores and PV Operations A semaphore is an integer variable, assigned different values based on the controlled object. Semaphores are divided into two categories:\nGeneral Semaphores. Used to achieve mutual exclusion between processes, initially valued at 1 or the number of available resources. Private Semaphores. Used to achieve synchronization between processes, initially valued at 0 or some positive integer. The physical meaning of semaphore S: S ≥ 0 indicates the number of available resources. If S \u0026lt; 0, its absolute value represents the number of processes waiting for that resource in the blocked queue.\nFor every process in the system, its correct operation depends not only on its own correctness but also on its ability to correctly implement synchronization and mutual exclusion with other related processes during execution. PV operations are common methods for implementing process synchronization and mutual exclusion. P and V operations are low-level communication primitives and are indivisible during execution. The P operation requests a resource, and the V operation releases a resource.\nDefinition of P Operation S := S - 1. If S ≥ 0, the process executing the P operation continues. Otherwise, the process is set to a blocked state (due to no available resources) and inserted into the blocked queue.\nThe P operation can be represented by the following procedure, where Semaphore indicates that the defined variable is a semaphore:\n1 2 3 4 5 Procedure P(Var S:Semaphore); Begain S := S - 1; If S \u0026lt; 0 then W(S) {Insert process executing P operation into waiting queue} End; Definition of V Operation S := S + 1. If S \u0026gt; 0, the process executing the V operation continues. Otherwise, a process is awakened from the blocked state and inserted into the ready queue, then the process executing the V operation continues.\nThe V operation can be represented by the following procedure:\n1 2 3 4 5 Procedure V(Var S:Semaphore); Begain S := S + 1; If S \u0026lt;= 0 then R(S) {Wake up a process from the blocked queue} End; Implementing Process Mutual Exclusion with PV Operations For example, the following two processes might lead to incorrect changes in the COUNT value:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 # 1 if a car passes then COUNT := COUNT + 1; GOTO L1; # 2 PRINT COUNT; COUNT := 0; GOTO L2; Let the initial value of the mutex semaphore be 1. Execute a P operation to lock the resource before entering the critical section, and a V operation after leaving it. The code is as follows:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 # 1 if a car passes then begin P(mutex) COUNT := COUNT + 1; V(mutex) end GOTO L1; # 2 begin P(mutex) PRINT COUNT; COUNT := 0; V(mutex) end GOTO L2; Recommended viewing: 【操作系统】进程间通信—互斥 (Operating Systems: Inter-Process Communication - Mutual Exclusion)\nImplementing Process Synchronization with PV Operations Process synchronization arises from mutual constraints due to process cooperation. To achieve process synchronization, a semaphore can be linked to a message. When the semaphore\u0026rsquo;s value is 0, it means the desired message has not been produced. When its value is non-zero, it means the desired message already exists. Suppose semaphore S represents a certain message. A process can test if the message has arrived by calling the P operation, and notify that the message is ready by calling the V operation. The most typical synchronization problem is the single-buffer producer-consumer synchronization problem.\nRecommended viewing: 【操作系统】进程间通信—同步 (Operating Systems: Inter-Process Communication - Synchronization)\nDeadlock Caused by Improper Allocation of Homogeneous Resources If a system has m resources shared by n processes, and each process requires k resources, a deadlock might occur if m \u0026lt; nk, meaning the total number of resources is less than the total required by all processes.\nFor example, if m=5, n=3, k=3, and the system uses a round-robin allocation strategy, the system first allocates one resource to each process in the first round, leaving two resources. In the second round, the system allocates one more resource to two processes. At this point, no resources are available for allocation, causing all processes to be in a waiting state, leading to system deadlock.\nIn fact, a deadlock will not occur when m ≥ n × (k - 1).\nDeadlock Handling The main strategies for handling deadlocks are four: the Ostrich Algorithm (i.e., the ignore strategy), prevention strategy, avoidance strategy, and detection and recovery.\nDeadlock Prevention Deadlock prevention involves adopting a strategy to restrict concurrent processes\u0026rsquo; resource requests, thereby breaking one of the four necessary conditions for deadlock, ensuring the system never meets the deadlock conditions at any time. Two strategies for deadlock prevention are:\nPre-allocation (Static Allocation). This breaks the \u0026ldquo;no preemption\u0026rdquo; condition by allocating all required resources beforehand, ensuring no waiting for resources. The problem with this method is that it reduces resource utilization and process concurrency; sometimes, required resources cannot be known in advance. Resource Ordering Allocation. This breaks the \u0026ldquo;circular wait\u0026rdquo; condition by classifying resources and arranging them in a specific order, ensuring no circular wait forms. The problem with this method is that it restricts processes\u0026rsquo; resource requests and resource ordering incurs system overhead. Deadlock Avoidance Deadlock avoidance aims to break one of the four necessary conditions for deadlock, strictly preventing deadlocks from occurring. Deadlock avoidance does not restrict the necessary conditions as strictly. The most famous deadlock avoidance algorithm is Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s Banker\u0026rsquo;s Algorithm. Deadlock avoidance algorithms typically require significant system overhead.\nRecommended viewing: 银行家算法 (Banker\u0026rsquo;s Algorithm)\nThreads Traditional processes have two fundamental attributes: they are an independent unit for owning resources and an independent unit for scheduling and allocation. Threads were introduced because process creation, destruction, and switching incur significant time and space overhead for the system. Therefore, the number of processes in a system should not be too high, and the frequency of process switching should not be too high, which limits the improvement of concurrency.\nWith the introduction of threads, these two fundamental attributes of traditional processes are separated. A thread acts as the basic unit of scheduling and allocation, while a process serves as the unit for independent resource allocation. Users can create threads to complete tasks, reducing the time and space overhead when programs execute concurrently.\nThis way, the basic unit for resource ownership doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to switch frequently, further increasing the concurrency of programs within the system. It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that a thread is an entity within a process, a basic unit independently allocated and scheduled by the system. Threads typically own minimal resources (like a program counter, a set of registers, and a stack) but can share all resources owned by their parent process with other threads belonging to the same process.\n","date":"2025-03-16T19:35:38+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/242/","title":"Software Designer - Operating System Notes"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash This article was written on 2024-04-29, then revised once.

That is, until I saw some nice Japanese fonts while browsing. I had to snag them, only to realize the fonts for my other languages were\u0026hellip; well, pretty rough.\nImporting Fonts Google Fonts Using a service like Google Fonts is usually the fastest and easiest way.\nFor example, I\u0026rsquo;m using Comic Neue, Noto Sans JP, Noto Sans SC, Noto Sans TC, and Yomogi. After selecting them, Google Fonts generates an HTML tag to drop into your \u0026lt;head\u0026gt;.\n1 \u0026lt;link href=\u0026#34;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Comic+Neue:ital,wght@0,300;0,400;0,700;1,300;1,400;1,700\u0026amp;family=Noto+Sans+JP:wght@100..900\u0026amp;family=Noto+Sans+SC:wght@100..900\u0026amp;family=Noto+Sans+TC:wght@100..900\u0026amp;family=Yomogi\u0026amp;display=swap\u0026#34; rel=\u0026#34;stylesheet\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Custom Imports You can also host your own .ttf, .woff, or .woff2 files. I recommend .woff2 or .woff for smaller file sizes. (Advanced optimization involves font subsetting/splitting, which is how Google Fonts handles it).\nI\u0026rsquo;m using the Yozai Font . The original .ttf is massive, so I compressed it using a tool like Transfonter before importing.\nFirst, place the font files in a directory, then define the font family in your SCSS.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s my setup. Usually, .woff2 and .woff are enough. I kept .ttf for legacy browser support (honestly, I just uploaded it before I knew better and had to optimize later).\nSet font-display: swap; so the browser uses a fallback font while downloading. This prevents blank text and improves the user experience.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 @font-face { font-family: \u0026#39;yozai\u0026#39;; src: url(\u0026#39;/fonts/Yozai-Regular.woff2\u0026#39;) format(\u0026#39;woff2\u0026#39;), // url(\u0026#39;/fonts/Yozai-Regular.woff\u0026#39;) format(\u0026#39;woff\u0026#39;), url(\u0026#39;/fonts/Yozai-Regular.ttf\u0026#39;) format(\u0026#39;truetype\u0026#39;); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-display: swap; } Where to Put It For Google Fonts, my theme has a custom.html for code that needs to go into the \u0026lt;head\u0026gt;.\nFor self-hosted files, the theme provides a custom.scss.\nFont configurations are handled in variables.scss in my theme, so I modified that directly.\nConfiguring Fonts Set specific fonts based on the language.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 /** * Global font family */ :root { // --sys-font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \u0026#34;Segoe UI\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Droid Sans\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Helvetica Neue\u0026#34;; --sys-font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, \u0026#34;Segoe UI\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Helvetica Neue\u0026#34;, Arial, sans-serif; --zh-font-family: \u0026#34;yozai\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Noto Sans SC\u0026#34;, var(--sys-font-family); --zh-TW-font-family: \u0026#34;yozai\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Noto Sans TC\u0026#34;, var(--sys-font-family); --ja-font-family: \u0026#34;Yomogi\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Noto Sans JP\u0026#34;, var(--sys-font-family); --en-font-family: \u0026#34;Comic Sans MS\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Comic Neue\u0026#34;, var(--sys-font-family); --base-font-family: var(--sys-font-family), sans-serif; --code-font-family: ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, \u0026#34;Liberation Mono\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Courier New\u0026#34;, monospace; } I added font variables for other languages following the existing naming convention.

Pris-Magic! https://blog.yexca.net/archives/260 Introduction Just by the title, I roughly grasped the song\u0026rsquo;s meaning, and it also triggered my past thoughts on life. Before, I could never find an answer to \u0026ldquo;why live?\u0026rdquo;. But, flipping it, \u0026ldquo;why not end it?\u0026rdquo;. I explored ways to commit suicide and their consequences. I realized I feared suicide. So, because of that fear, I chose to live. This perfectly aligns with the song.\nSpeaking of which, I\u0026rsquo;ve listened to many works by Kohana Lam before. Back then, she\u0026rsquo;d often sing tearfully, which made it hard for me to watch sometimes. I was genuinely worried if she\u0026rsquo;d be okay. Then, YouTube Music pushed new, cheerful songs from her. I was genuinely happy she\u0026rsquo;d moved past her sadness (even though I hadn\u0026rsquo;t).\nAfter diving deep into this song (and understanding the lyrics), I realized how great it is. Wish I\u0026rsquo;d found it sooner. Also, I think this series of articles is pretty cool. It\u0026rsquo;s taught me so much from songs I only partially understood before. I feel like this isn\u0026rsquo;t just learning Japanese from songs; it\u0026rsquo;s learning about life. Discovering a different side to songs I\u0026rsquo;d heard before is truly amazing. I like them even more now. (It actually reminded me of Asuna\u0026rsquo;s question to Kirito about discovering another side of someone – yeah, you really do like them more!)\nBy the way, as per this series\u0026rsquo; custom, translations aren\u0026rsquo;t always literal.

Given their critical position in network systems and the constant security threats they face, choosing a secure, stable, and reliable firewall product is paramount.\nFirewall technology has evolved through three main stages: packet filtering, application proxy gateways, and stateful inspection.\nPacket Filtering Firewalls Packet filtering firewalls typically have a packet inspection block (often called a packet filter). Packet filtering controls access between sites, sites and networks, or networks and networks based on information in the packet header. However, it can\u0026rsquo;t control the content of transmitted data, as content is application layer data, and the packet filter operates between the network and data link layers (i.e., TCP and IP layers). The inspection module allows the firewall to intercept and examine all outbound and inbound data. It first opens the packet, extracts the header, determines if the packet conforms to the packet filtering rules based on the header info, and logs it. Packets that don\u0026rsquo;t conform to the rules should trigger an alert and be dropped.\nPacket filtering firewalls usually forward packets directly; they are completely transparent to users and operate quickly. Their advantages include: low-level control over every incoming and outgoing packet; examination of each IP packet field (e.g., source address, destination address, protocol, port); ability to identify and drop packets with spoofed source IP addresses; acting as the sole source of access between two networks; and often being integrated into router software, eliminating the need for extra systems. Disadvantages include: inability to defend against hacker attacks, as network admins cannot distinguish reliable from unreliable network boundaries; lack of application layer protocol support because they don\u0026rsquo;t recognize application layer protocols within packets, leading to coarse-grained access control; and inability to handle new security threats.\nApplication Proxy Gateway Firewalls Application proxy gateway firewalls completely sever direct communication between internal and external networks. An internal user\u0026rsquo;s access to the external network becomes the firewall\u0026rsquo;s access to the external network, which is then forwarded by the firewall to the internal user. All communications must be forwarded by application layer proxy software. At no point can a visitor establish a direct TCP connection with the server; the application layer protocol session must comply with the proxy\u0026rsquo;s security policy requirements.\nAdvantages of application proxy gateways include their ability to inspect protocol features at the application, transport, and network layers, providing strong packet inspection capabilities. Disadvantages are their complexity to configure and very slow processing speeds.\nStateful Inspection Firewalls Stateful inspection firewalls combine the security of proxy firewalls with the high speed of packet filtering firewalls. They enhance the performance of proxy firewalls without compromising security.\nViruses Characteristics of computer viruses include: transmissibility, stealth, infectivity, latency, triggerability, and destructiveness.\nWorm refers to worm viruses, Trojan to Trojan horses, Backdoor to backdoor viruses, and Macro to macro viruses.\nMacro viruses primarily infect text documents, spreadsheets, etc.\nTrojan software: Binghe\nWorm viruses: Happy99, Panda Burning Incense, Code Red, ILOVEYOU, Stuxnet.\nNetwork Attacks Denial of Service (DoS) Attack: Aims to make a computer or network unable to provide normal services. DoS attacks are typically executed by continuously sending requests to a target computer.\nReplay Attack: An attacker sends a message that the target host has already accepted to achieve an attack goal. Attackers steal authentication credentials using network sniffing or other methods, then resend them to the authentication server. Primarily used during the authentication process to undermine its correctness.\nPassword Attack: Attackers log into the target host using the account and password of a legitimate user, then carry out malicious activities.\nTrojan Horse: Disguised as a legitimate program or game. When a user downloads software or an attachment containing the Trojan, the program initiates a connection request to the attacker. Once connected, the attacker carries out malicious activities.\nPort Exploitation Attack: Involves using port scanning to find system vulnerabilities and then exploit them.\nNetwork Sniffing: Attackers can intercept all information transmitted over a specific network segment on the same physical channel. Network sniffing allows for easy capture of data, including usernames and passwords.\nIP Spoofing Attack: Involves generating IP packets with a forged source IP address to impersonate another system or sender.\nSQL Injection Attack: One of the common methods hackers use to attack databases. It exploits applications that fail to validate the legitimacy of user input, creating security vulnerabilities. Attackers can submit a piece of database query code. Based on the program\u0026rsquo;s response, they can obtain desired data. By first gaining database privileges, they can acquire user account and password information, and even modify data.\nIntrusion Detection Techniques: Expert systems, model-based detection, simple pattern matching.\nNetwork Security SSL (Secure Socket Layer) is a transport layer security protocol developed by Netscape in 1994 to enable secure Web communication. The SSL 3.0 protocol draft, released in 1996, became a de facto Web security standard.\nTLS (Transport Layer Security) is an IETF-defined protocol. It builds upon the SSL 3.0 protocol specification and is the successor to SSL 3.0.\nThe protocol for secure connections between client devices and remote sites is SSH. SSH, short for Secure Shell, is an IETF-defined security protocol built upon the application and transport layers. It\u0026rsquo;s specifically designed to provide security for remote login sessions and other network services. By using SSH, information leakage during remote management can be effectively prevented. SSH originated as a program on UNIX and quickly expanded to other operating platforms.\nHTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol over Secure Socket Layer) is an HTTP channel designed for security, meaning it\u0026rsquo;s HTTP employing SSL encryption.\nMIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is an internet standard that extends the email standard to support: non-ASCII text, non-textual attachments (binary, audio, images, etc.), messages composed of multiple parts, and header information containing non-ASCII characters.\nPGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is email encryption software based on the RSA public-key cryptosystem. It can be used to keep emails confidential, preventing unauthorized reading, and to add a digital signature, allowing the recipient to verify the sender of the email.\n","date":"2025-03-04T18:38:28+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/238/","title":"Software Designer - InfoSec Notes"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Introduction Recently, I found that IDM couldn\u0026rsquo;t automatically capture files shared via OneDrive.

But they\u0026rsquo;re notes nonetheless, and it\u0026rsquo;s handy to have them on the blog for quick reference.\n1. Network Devices Layer Device Isolates Broadcast Domain Isolates Collision Domain Physical Layer Repeater / Hub ✗ ✗ Data Link Layer Bridge / Switch ✗ ✓ Network Layer Router ✓ ✓ Physical Layer Interconnection Devices Physical layer interconnection devices include Repeaters and Hubs.\nRepeater\nIt interconnects LAN segments at the physical layer, used to extend the length of LAN segments.\nHub\nA hub can be seen as a special multi-port repeater, also capable of signal amplification.\nData Link Layer Interconnection Devices Data link layer interconnection devices include Bridges and Switches.\nBridge\nA bridge connects two LAN segments.\nSwitch\nA switch is essentially a multi-port bridge.\nNetwork Layer Interconnection Devices A Router is a network layer interconnection device, used to connect multiple logically separate networks.\nApplication Layer Interconnection Devices A Gateway is an application layer interconnection device. When connecting networks of different types with significant protocol differences, a gateway is required.\n2. Protocol Suites The TCP/IP protocol suite for computer networks.\n3. TCP and UDP Internet Layer Protocol: IP The Internet Layer (Network Layer) is central to the entire TCP/IP suite. Besides IP, other key protocols defined here include ICMP, ARP, and RARP.\nIP\u0026rsquo;s service is generally considered connectionless and unreliable. However, under good network conditions, IP-transmitted data can reach its destination intact.\nConnectionless transmission means sending data without confirming the destination system is ready to receive it. In contrast, connection-oriented transmission (like TCP) requires a three-way handshake between source and destination before application-layer data transfer.\nAs for unreliable service, it means the destination system doesn\u0026rsquo;t acknowledge successfully received packets. IP just tries its best to deliver data. If reliability is needed, higher-layer protocols must implement additional services to ensure successful packet delivery.\nSince IP only offers connectionless, unreliable service, error detection and flow control are delegated to other layers. This is a key reason for TCP/IP\u0026rsquo;s efficiency.\nTransport Layer Protocol: TCP TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is one of the most important protocols in the TCP/IP suite. Building on IP\u0026rsquo;s unreliable data service, it provides applications with a reliable, connection-oriented, full-duplex data transfer service.\nReliable transmission, connection management, error checking and retransmission, flow control, congestion control, port addressing.\nFlow control, in particular, uses a variable-size sliding window protocol.\nBoth establishing and closing a TCP connection between source and destination hosts require a three-way handshake to confirm success.\nTransport Layer Protocol: UDP User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is an unreliable, connectionless protocol that enables communication between application processes. Compared to TCP, also in the transport layer, UDP is connectionless and has much weaker error detection. Simply put, TCP helps provide reliability, while UDP boosts transmission speed. For example, applications requiring interactive sessions (like FTP) often use TCP, while those performing their own error detection or needing none (like DNS, SNMP) typically use UDP.\nThe primary role of UDP protocol software is to present UDP messages to the application layer. It does not retransmit lost or erroneous data messages, reorder out-of-sequence IP datagrams, eliminate duplicate IP datagrams, acknowledge received datagrams, or establish/terminate connections. These concerns are handled by the applications using UDP for communication.\nWhile TCP provides reliable data transfer, it does so at the cost of overhead. This means TCP requires more time and traffic to accomplish the same task. Sacrificing some time for network reliability is acceptable when the network is unreliable. However, in highly reliable networks, UDP can be used to minimize traffic waste.\n4. SMTP and POP3 Email is an electronic medium for information exchange using computers. It emerged with computer networks, relying on network communication to transmit mail. It\u0026rsquo;s one of the most widely used services.\nEmail systems operate on a client/server model. Email servers primarily use SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). This protocol defines email message format and delivery methods, ensuring correct addressing and reliable transmission. As a text-oriented network protocol, its limitation is the inability to transmit non-ASCII text and non-text attachments, which becomes more apparent in the growing multimedia environment and concerns over email privacy.\nLater protocols, including MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) and PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Mail), addressed SMTP\u0026rsquo;s shortcomings. SMTP is used in large multi-user, multi-tasking operating systems, making it difficult to receive mail on PCs. Therefore, most mail management programs on TCP/IP networks use SMTP for sending mail and POP (Post Office Protocol, commonly POP3) to store mail not yet retrieved by users.\nPOP has two versions: POP2 and POP3. Currently, POP3 can be used with SMTP or independently for sending and receiving emails. POP is a simple, plain-text protocol; each transfer handles an entire email, without partial transfers.\nBoth SMTP and POP3 (for receiving mail) use TCP ports. SMTP uses port 25, and POP3 uses port 110.\n5. ARP, RARP, and DHCP ARP and RARP Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) are other important protocols residing in the Internet Layer (Network Layer). ARP translates IP addresses to physical addresses, while RARP translates physical addresses to IP addresses.\nEvery network device – hosts, routers, switches, etc. – has a unique physical address, provided by its network card. Each NIC has a distinct ID from the factory, meaning a unique physical address. On the other hand, to abstract away underlying protocols and physical address differences, the IP protocol uses IP addresses. Thus, IP and physical addresses must be inter-converted during data transmission.\nThe process for IP-to-physical address conversion using ARP is: When a computer needs to communicate with another, it first checks its ARP cache. If the IP address is found, it uses the corresponding physical address to directly send the datagram to the target NIC. If the ARP cache doesn\u0026rsquo;t contain the IP address, ARP sends an ARP request packet as a broadcast on the LAN.\nIf a computer on the LAN matches the requested IP address, it generates an ARP reply containing its physical address. The ARP protocol software then adds this IP-to-physical address mapping to its cache, and data communication can begin.\nDHCP DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) centralizes IP address management and allocation, allowing hosts in a network environment to dynamically obtain IP addresses, Gateway addresses, DNS server addresses, and other information, while also improving address utilization.\nA DHCP client can obtain its own IP address, DNS server address, DHCP server address, and default gateway address from a DHCP server.\nWindows invalid address: 169.254.x.x\nLinux invalid address: 0.0.0.0\n169.254.x.x is the IP address Windows automatically assigns to a client when DHCP lease acquisition fails.\n6. IP Addresses and Subnet Masks IP Addresses Internet addresses are described by names, making them easy to understand and remember. However, hosts on the Internet are uniquely identified by IP addresses. This is because the Internet uses the TCP/IP protocol, so every host must have an IP address.\nEach IP address consists of four numbers less than 256, separated by dots. An Internet IP address is 32 bits, or 4 bytes long. It has two formats: binary and decimal. Binary is what computers understand, while decimal is \u0026rsquo;translated\u0026rsquo; from binary for easier human use and comprehension. For example, the decimal IP address 129.102.4.11 is equivalent to the binary 10000001 01100110 00000100 00001011. Clearly, the dotted-decimal format is much more convenient.\nDomain names and IP addresses have a one-to-one mapping. Domain names are easier to remember and use, hence their widespread adoption. When a user exchanges information with a computer on the Internet, they only need to use the domain name; the network automatically converts it to an IP address to locate that computer.\nInternet addresses are categorized into 5 classes: Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D, and Class E. In an IP address, all zeros represent the network, and all ones represent a broadcast.\nClass A network addresses use 1 byte (8 bits), with the highest bit set to 0 to identify this class. The remaining 7 bits form the actual network address, supporting 1 to 126 networks. The subsequent 3 bytes (24 bits) are for host addresses, providing addressing for $2^{24}-2$ endpoints.\nThe first octet of a Class A network address ranges from 000 to 127 in decimal.\nClass B network addresses use two bytes, with the highest two bits set to 10 to identify this class. The remaining 14 bits form the actual network address. Host addresses use the latter two bytes (16 bits). Thus, the total number of addresses in Class B is ($2^{14}-2$)($2^{16}-2$) = 16382 × 65534.\nThe first octet of a Class B network address ranges from 128 to 191 in decimal.\nClass C network addresses use 3 bytes and are the most common Internet addresses. The highest three bits are set to 110 to identify this class, with the remaining 21 bits forming the actual network address. Therefore, Class C supports $2^{21}-2$ networks. The last 1 byte is for host addresses, allowing up to $2^8-2$ hosts per network.\nThe first octet of a Class C network address ranges from 192 to 223 in decimal.\nClass D addresses are relatively new. Their identifier prefix is 1110, used for multicasting, for example, in router modifications.\nThe first octet of a Class D network address ranges from 224 to 239 in decimal.\nClass E addresses are reserved for experimental use, with an identifier prefix of 1111.\nThe first octet of a Class E network address ranges from 240 to 255 in decimal.\nNetwork software and routers use a Subnet Mask to determine if a packet is staying within the local network or being routed elsewhere. Within a field, a \u0026lsquo;1\u0026rsquo; indicates that portion is part of the network address, while a \u0026lsquo;0\u0026rsquo; indicates a host address position. For example, the common Class C address uses the first 3 bytes for the network ID and the last byte (8 bits) for the host ID. Hence, its subnet mask is 255.255.255.0.\nIPv6 Introduction IPv6 features a 128-bit address space, thoroughly solving the IPv4 address depletion issue. Beyond that, IPv6 also incorporates hierarchical addressing, efficient IP packet headers, Quality of Service (QoS), stateless address autoconfiguration, authentication, and encryption, among many other technologies.\n7. Windows Commands ipconfig /release: DHCP client manually releases IP address.\nipconfig /flushdns: Clears local DNS cache content.\nipconfig /displaydns: Displays local DNS content.\nipconfig /registerdns: DNS client manually registers with the server.\nipconfig: Shows IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway for all network adapters.\nipconfig /all: Displays full TCP/IP configuration info for all network adapters, including whether DHCP service is enabled.\nipconfig /renew: DHCP client manually renews its request (re-applies for an IP address) with the server.\n8. Routing Windows Server 2003 has 5 routing types. When a Windows server receives an IP packet, it first looks for host routes, then network routes (direct and remote), and if those fail, it finally looks for a default route.\nAdministrative distances for various route sources are as follows:\nIf a router receives multiple routes for a certain destination, forwarded by different routing protocols, it compares their administrative distances and uses the route information from the source with the smallest administrative distance.\n","date":"2025-03-01T23:28:30+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/236/","title":"Software Designer - Computer Networks Notes"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash Elasticsearch Series\nContent Link Elasticsearch Basic Operations https://blog.yexca.net/archives/226 Elasticsearch Query Operations https://blog.yexca.net/archives/227 RestClient Basic Operations https://blog.yexca.net/archives/228 RestClient Query Operations https://blog.yexca.net/archives/229 Elasticsearch Data Aggregation https://blog.yexca.net/archives/231 Elasticsearch Autocomplete https://blog.yexca.net/archives/232 Elasticsearch Data Sync https://blog.yexca.net/archives/234 Elasticsearch Cluster This Article A standalone ES setup for data storage inevitably faces two issues: massive data storage and single point of failure.\nMassive data storage: Logically split the index into N shards, storing them across multiple nodes. Single point of failure: Back up shard data on different nodes (replicas). ES Cluster Concepts\nCluster: A group of nodes sharing a common cluster name.\nNode: An ES instance within the cluster.\nShard: An index can be split into different parts for storage, called shards. In a clustered environment, different shards of an index can be distributed across various nodes.\nSolves: The problem of too much data for a single point of storage. Shards are similar to HDFS where data is split and backed up multiple times. Primary shard: Defined in relation to replica shards.\nReplica shard: Each primary shard can have one or more replicas, holding the same data as the primary.\nSetting up an ES Cluster This can be done using docker-compose.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 version: \u0026#39;2.2\u0026#39; services: es01: image: elasticsearch:7.12.1 container_name: es01 environment: - node.name=es01 - cluster.name=es-docker-cluster - discovery.seed_hosts=es02,es03 - cluster.initial_master_nodes=es01,es02,es03 - \u0026#34;ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m\u0026#34; volumes: - data01:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data ports: - 9200:9200 networks: - elastic es02: image: elasticsearch:7.12.1 container_name: es02 environment: - node.name=es02 - cluster.name=es-docker-cluster - discovery.seed_hosts=es01,es03 - cluster.initial_master_nodes=es01,es02,es03 - \u0026#34;ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m\u0026#34; volumes: - data02:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data ports: - 9201:9200 networks: - elastic es03: image: elasticsearch:7.12.1 container_name: es03 environment: - node.name=es03 - cluster.name=es-docker-cluster - discovery.seed_hosts=es01,es02 - cluster.initial_master_nodes=es01,es02,es03 - \u0026#34;ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m\u0026#34; volumes: - data03:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data networks: - elastic ports: - 9202:9200 volumes: data01: driver: local data02: driver: local data03: driver: local networks: elastic: driver: bridge ES requires some Linux system permission modifications.

Github: https://github.com/lmenezes/cerebro After running bin/cerebro.bat, access http://localhost:9000 to enter the management interface.\nCerebro allows for visual index creation. Below is a DSL example for creation:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 PUT /indexName { \u0026#34;settings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;number_of_shards\u0026#34;: 3, // Number of shards \u0026#34;number_of_replicas\u0026#34;: 1 // Number of replicas }, \u0026#34;mappings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;properties\u0026#34;: { // mapping definition ... } } } Cluster Role Assignment Nodes in an ES cluster have different roles.\nNode Type Config Parameter Default Value Node Responsibilities Master-eligible node.master true Can manage and record cluster state, determine shard allocation, and handle index creation/deletion requests. Data node.data true Stores data, handles search, aggregation, and CRUD operations. Ingest node.ingest true Pre-processing data before storage. Coordinating If all 3 parameters above are false, it\u0026rsquo;s a coordinating node. None Routes requests to other nodes, combines results from other nodes, and returns them to the user. By default, any node in the cluster possesses all four roles simultaneously.\nHowever, in a real cluster, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to separate node roles.\nMaster node: High CPU requirements, but low memory requirements. Data node: High CPU and memory requirements. Coordinating node: High network bandwidth and CPU requirements. Role separation allows us to allocate different hardware based on node requirements and prevents interference between different responsibilities.\nCluster Split-Brain Issue Split-brain occurs due to network isolation between nodes in a cluster.\nAssume a three-node cluster where the master node (node1) loses connection with other nodes (network partition). Node2 and Node3 will deem node1 as down and initiate a new master election. If node3 gets elected, the cluster continues serving requests. Node2 and Node3 form their own cluster, while node1 forms its own. Data desynchronization occurs, leading to data discrepancies.\nWhen the network partition resolves, with two master nodes existing, the cluster state becomes inconsistent, resulting in a split-brain scenario.\nSolution: A node needs more than (number of eligible nodes + 1) / 2 votes to be elected as master. Therefore, an odd number of eligible nodes is recommended. The corresponding configuration is discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes, which became the default in ES 7.0+, so split-brain issues are generally less common now.\nFor instance, in the three-node cluster above, a node needs more than (3+1)/2 = 2 votes. Node3 receives votes from Node2 and Node3, becoming the master. Node1 only gets its own vote and isn\u0026rsquo;t elected. The cluster still has only one master, avoiding split-brain.\nCluster Distributed Storage When adding a new document, it should be saved to different shards to ensure data balance. So, how does the coordinating node determine which shard the data should be stored in?\nES uses a hash algorithm to calculate which shard a document should be stored in.\nFormula: shard = hash(_routing) % number_of_shards\nExplanation:\n_routing defaults to the document\u0026rsquo;s ID. The algorithm depends on the number of shards, so once an index is created, the shard count cannot be changed. New Document Flow:\nFlow:\nAdd a document with id = 1. Perform a hash operation on the ID. If the result is 2, it\u0026rsquo;s stored in shard-2. The primary shard for shard-2 is on node3, so the data is routed to node3. Save the document. Synchronize with shard-2\u0026rsquo;s replica-2 on node2. Return the result to the coordinating-node. Cluster Distributed Queries ES queries are divided into two phases:\nScatter phase: The coordinating node distributes the request to every shard. Gather phase: The coordinating node aggregates search results from data nodes, processes them into a final result set, and returns it to the user. Cluster Fault Tolerance The cluster\u0026rsquo;s master node monitors the status of nodes. If a node fails, it immediately migrates the failed node\u0026rsquo;s shard data to other nodes to ensure data safety. This is known as fault tolerance.\nAssume a three-node cluster where node1 is the master.\nNode1 goes down. A new master election is needed. Assume node2 is elected. After node2 becomes the master, it checks the cluster status. Discovering that node1\u0026rsquo;s shards have no replica nodes, it needs to migrate the data from node1 to node2 and node3.

So, when MySQL data changes, ES also needs to update. This is what we call data synchronization between ES and MySQL.\nCommon data synchronization solutions include three main types:\nSynchronous Call Asynchronous Notification Binlog Listening Synchronous Call Steps:\nhotel-demo exposes an API for modifying data in ES. The backend management system (hotel-admin) directly calls the API provided by hotel-demo after completing its database operations. Asynchronous Notification Steps:\nhotel-admin sends an MQ message after performing CRUD operations on MySQL data. hotel-demo listens to the MQ, and updates ES data upon receiving the message. Binlog Listening Process:\nEnable MySQL\u0026rsquo;s binlog feature.

It logs the teas I\u0026rsquo;ve tasted and my personal take on them during this period.\nHonestly, towards the later part, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really into this hobby anymore, so the logging got pretty casual. But hey, it was a hobby I pursued, and since the article number hit 233, why not drop something that might be a bit interesting? (Thought I\u0026rsquo;d published this way earlier, kept pushing it back)\nBlack Tea Name Taste Concubine\u0026rsquo;s Smile First sip, a rather stuffy, cloying feel.After multiple infusions, a sweet potato aroma emerges.About 12 infusions. Peach First infusion, slightly more bitter than Concubine's Smile, not cloying.Had trouble breathing and nosebleeds at night; unsure if tea was the cause. Xigui Black First sip, sweet but not cloying, bitter but not astringent. Pretty good. Keemun Black Tea First sip, similar to Xigui Black, not sweet, but seems more robust/mellow.Tea leaves are quite fine/broken. Jin Jun Mei Overly mellow, even slightly bitter and astringent. But after the third cup, a lingering aroma and sweetness stay in the mouth.Tea leaves are quite fine/broken, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t stand up to many infusions. Drunken Red Just that classic black tea taste.Decent number of infusions, but don\u0026rsquo;t steep it too long; lots of broken bits. Lapsang Souchong Definitely a smoky flavor.\nBitter on the palate, but the aftertaste is sweet. Old Bush Black Tea Good taste. Dark Tea Name Taste Golden Award Six Categories Tastes like Eight-Treasure Porridge. Ginseng-Scented Liu Bao Has a medicinal bitterness. Tian Jian First taste, surprisingly good (maybe because I\u0026rsquo;d just had the two teas above).\nBitter and astringent, but has a sweet aftertaste.\nToo bitter and astringent after many sips. Golden Flower Fu Zhuan A milder \u0026ldquo;Golden Award Six Categories\u0026rdquo; + a milder \u0026ldquo;Ginseng-Scented Liu Bao\u0026rdquo;. Old Green Brick Old wood taste, too many tea bits. Old Ripe Puerh Doesn\u0026rsquo;t taste very good. Old Raw Puerh Hard to brew open, bitter. Ancient Tree Ripe Puerh Compared to the two above, it\u0026rsquo;s okay. Puerh Raw Tea Slightly bitter and astringent on the first sip, then a sweet aftertaste.\nMold appeared on top after two days; noticeable bitterness and astringency when brewed. Puerh Ripe Tea Eight-Treasure Porridge taste. White Tea Name Taste Wild Gong Mei On the palate, a fresh, tender crop-like slight bitterness and astringency, sweet and soft. Xigui White Block-shaped leaves, tastes honey-sweet after unfurling, lingering aroma in the mouth.\nMany infusions, \u0026gt;10. Wild White (Xiao Bai) Bitter and astringent while drinking, sweet aftertaste afterward. Silver Needle Very light tea color, first infusion has a slight grassy taste, then a bit of honey sweetness, with a lingering sweet aftertaste. Rock Sugar Sweet First two infusions grassy, then normal white tea taste. Aged White Tea Classic white tea taste, sweet enough. Gao Shou First sip grassy, then normal white tea taste. Oolong Tea Name Taste Da Hong Pao Plenty of it, decent, slightly sweet. Tie Guan Yin Fragrant but bitter and astringent. Orchid-Base Shui Xian Bitter and astringent. Duck Shit Aroma Dan Cong First two infusions a faint oolong fragrance, then mild flavor. Honey Orchid Aroma Dan Cong Tasteless on the palate, then a lingering aroma, very bitter afterward. Lishan Oolong Faint woody taste, normal oolong taste after brewing open. Flowing Fragrance Rou Gui Woody taste on the palate, then a sweet aftertaste. Bai Mu Dan First whiff, an oil tea scent; woody taste on the palate. Light Fragrance Tie Guan Yin Tastes pretty similar, light fragrance. Zhangping Shui Xian Tastes pretty similar, light fragrance. Traditional Tie Guan Yin Decent taste compared to the ones above. Yancha (Rock Tea) Name Taste Da Hong Pao Bitter. Apricot Peach Aroma Weird, bitter. Buddha Kingdom Rock Rou Gui Slightly bitter on the palate, then a lingering aroma. Buddha Hand Snow Pear Seems to only have bitterness, with a lingering aroma a while later. Lingering Fragrance Rou Gui Same as above, that Yancha feel. Orchid Base Shui Xian Super nice name, but the taste is still that Yancha vibe, though the sweetness is higher. Qi Dan Printed character looks like \u0026lsquo;上\u0026rsquo; over \u0026lsquo;可\u0026rsquo;, but no idea what it actually is, and no handwritten version either.\nRelatively lighter flavor, keeps that Yancha sweet aftertaste. Pretty good experience. Uncategorized Name Taste Little Green Mandarin (Xiao Qing Gan) Dark tea, not good, slightly sour.\nTerrible experience, turned sour on the third day. Anji Bai Looks good, very fragrant, chestnut flavor, slightly cloying. Mengding Huang Ya Similar to the previous one, slightly better. Jasmine Snow Bud Leaves are fragrant, tea soup is clear and fragrant, lingering aroma after drinking.\nOolong tea?

Providing full word completion based on typed letters is what we call autocomplete.\nPinyin Tokenization To enable letter-based autocomplete, documents must be tokenized by pinyin.\nProject URL: https://github.com/medcl/elasticsearch-analysis-pinyin Installation is similar to the IK tokenizer. Here\u0026rsquo;s how to install it online, starting with entering the container:\n1 docker exec -it es /bin/bash Execute the command:\n1 ./bin/elasticsearch-plugin install https://github.com/infinilabs/analysis-pinyin/releases/download/v7.12.1/elasticsearch-analysis-pinyin-7.12.1.zip Then exit and restart:\n1 2 3 4 # Exit exit # Restart docker restart es Test:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 # Test Pinyin Tokenization POST /_analyze { \u0026#34;text\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;世界第一可爱\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;analyzer\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;pinyin\u0026#34; } Custom Analyzer The default pinyin tokenizer splits each Chinese character into individual pinyin. However, we want each term to form a group of pinyin. This requires customizing the pinyin tokenizer to create a custom analyzer.\nIn ES, an analyzer consists of three parts:\ncharacter filters: Process text before the tokenizer. For example, deleting or replacing characters. tokenizer: Splits text into terms based on specific rules. For example, \u0026lsquo;keyword\u0026rsquo; tokenizes nothing; \u0026lsquo;ik_smart\u0026rsquo; is another. token filter: Further processes terms output by the tokenizer. For example, case conversion, synonym handling, pinyin processing. Here\u0026rsquo;s the syntax for declaring a custom analyzer:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 # Custom Analyzer PUT /test { \u0026#34;settings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;analysis\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;analyzer\u0026#34;: { // Custom analyzers \u0026#34;my_analyzer\u0026#34;: { // Analyzer name \u0026#34;tokenizer\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ik_max_word\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;filter\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;py\u0026#34; } }, \u0026#34;filter\u0026#34;: { // Custom token filter \u0026#34;py\u0026#34;: { // Filter name \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;pinyin\u0026#34;, // Filter type // Configuration options explained on GitHub \u0026#34;keep_full_piny\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;keep_joined_full_pinyin\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;keep_original\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;limit_first_letter_length\u0026#34;: 16, \u0026#34;remove_duplicated_term\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;none_chinese_pinyin_tokenize\u0026#34;: false } } } }, \u0026#34;mappings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;properties\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;text\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;analyzer\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my_analyzer\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;search_analyzer\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ik_smart\u0026#34; } } } } Test:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 # Test Custom Analyzer POST /test/_analyze { \u0026#34;text\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;世界第一可爱\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;analyzer\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my_analyzer\u0026#34; } Autocomplete Query ES provides the Completion Suggester query for autocomplete. This query matches and returns terms starting with the user\u0026rsquo;s input. To boost efficiency, there are some constraints on the field types in documents for completion queries:\nFields involved in completion queries must be of \u0026lsquo;completion\u0026rsquo; type.

For instance:\nWhich phone brands are most popular? What\u0026rsquo;s the average, max, and min price for these phones? How do these phones sell each month? Types of Aggregations Commonly, there are three types:\nBucket Aggregations: Used to group documents. TermAggregation: Groups by document field values, like by brand or country. Date Histogram: Groups by date intervals, e.g., weekly or monthly. Metric Aggregations: Used to calculate things like max, min, or average values. Avg: Average value. Max: Maximum value. Min: Minimum value. Stats: Computes max, min, avg, sum, etc., all at once. Pipeline Aggregations: Perform aggregations based on the results of other aggregations. Fields participating in aggregations must be of type keyword, date, numeric, or boolean.\nDSL Aggregation Statements bucket Count how many hotel brands exist across all data, i.e., group data by brand.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 # bucket term GET /hotel/_search { \u0026#34;size\u0026#34;: 0, // Set size to 0 to exclude documents, only return aggregation results. \u0026#34;aggs\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;brandAgg\u0026#34;: { // Aggregation name \u0026#34;terms\u0026#34;: { // Aggregation type \u0026#34;field\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;brand\u0026#34;, // Field for aggregation \u0026#34;size\u0026#34;: 20 // Number of aggregation results to retrieve } } } } Sorting Aggregation Results By default, bucket aggregations count documents within each bucket (as _count) and sort by _count in descending order. You can customize the sort order using the order property.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 GET /hotel/_search { \u0026#34;size\u0026#34;: 0, \u0026#34;aggs\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;brandAgg\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;terms\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;field\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;brand\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;size\u0026#34;: 20, \u0026#34;order\u0026#34;: { // Sorting \u0026#34;_count\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;asc\u0026#34; } } } } } Limiting Aggregation Scope By default, aggregations run on all documents in the index.

Prism Magic! https://blog.yexca.net/archives/260 Intro Today, I tried the December 2019 N1 test. Accidentally passed! That instantly sparked my desire to write articles about learning Japanese – thus, this series was born.\nPicking a song was a bit of a pain. Lately, I\u0026rsquo;ve been jamming to music (I usually call stuff with vocals \u0026lsquo;songs\u0026rsquo; and instrumental tracks \u0026lsquo;music\u0026rsquo;), and you can\u0026rsquo;t really write about just music, right?\nI tried checking YouTube Music for my most-played tracks each season, but nothing quite hit the \u0026rsquo;loop forever\u0026rsquo; spot (good for a single listen, but not that good). Digging through my history, I found this song.\nSpeaking of this track, it\u0026rsquo;s probably the first song where I understood most of it without looking at the lyrics (yeah, a bit contradictory, but whatever). I looped it countless times. Honestly, it\u0026rsquo;s what got me into Uruha Rushia (even though she\u0026rsquo;s no longer active). How can a song be this sweet? Absolutely love it!\nSong Video Lyrics 夢の中で君と過ごしても\nEven if I spend time with you in my dreams\nまた覚めるたび君が離れないの\nEvery time I wake up, you\u0026rsquo;re still on my mind\n退屈なベッドで1人きり\nAlone in this boring bed\nあぁ 迎えに来てよ王子様\nAh~, come pick me up, my prince\n君を知りたい 気持ちもどかしい\nI want to know you, this feeling is so frustrating\nいっそシャボン玉になって弾けたい\nI wish I could just turn into a bubble and burst\nあぁ 君が好き なんて言えない\nAh~, I like you, but I can\u0026rsquo;t say it\nたまに冷たい 君がわかんない\nSometimes you\u0026rsquo;re cold, I just don\u0026rsquo;t get you\n君の場所びゅーんと飛んでって\nZooming right to your place\nアニメみたいに2人恋に落ちて\nLike in an anime, we both fall in love\nくすぐったいくらいに君のこと\nJust thinking about you makes me tingly\n考える1人の夜がいいの\nThose nights alone, just thinking of you, are nice\nふわふわと浮かぶ甘い心\nThis sweet, fluffy heart, floating around\n頭離れない君は悪い男？\nYou\u0026rsquo;re stuck in my head, are you a bad guy?\nわからないことにもやもやして\nGetting fuzzy over things I don\u0026rsquo;t understand\n夢でも君のことを考えて\nEven in dreams, I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of you\nあぁ いじけちゃって嫌になっても 考えちゃう\nAh~, even when I\u0026rsquo;m sulking and hating it, I can\u0026rsquo;t help but think of you\nねぇ 優しかったり冷たくなったり 迷路みたい\nHey, you\u0026rsquo;re sometimes kind, sometimes cold, like a maze\nあぁ 攻略サイトも見当たらないから やり直しばかり\nAh~, can\u0026rsquo;t even find a walkthrough, so it\u0026rsquo;s just restarts, over and over\nもー知らないもんって強がり\n\u0026ldquo;Ugh, I don\u0026rsquo;t care anymore!\u0026rdquo;

So, parsing the response means parsing the JSON string layer by layer, as follows:\nSearchHits: Obtained via response.getHits(), this is the outermost hits in the JSON, representing the matched results. SearchHits.getTotalHits().value: Gets the total hit count. SearchHits.getHits(): Gets the SearchHit array, which is the document array. SearchHit.getSourceAsString(): Gets _source from the document results, which is the raw JSON document data. match and multi_match Similar to match_all, the difference is the query condition.\nmatch Code\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 @Test public void testMatch() throws IOException { SearchRequest request = new SearchRequest(\u0026#34;hotel\u0026#34;); request.source().query(QueryBuilders.matchQuery(\u0026#34;all\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;如家\u0026#34;)); SearchResponse response = client.search(request, RequestOptions.DEFAULT); SearchHits searchHits = response.getHits(); long total = searchHits.getTotalHits().value; System.out.println(total); SearchHit[] hits = searchHits.getHits(); for (SearchHit hit : hits) { String json = hit.getSourceAsString(); System.out.println(json); } } multi_match Code\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 @Test public void testMultiMatch() throws IOException { SearchRequest request = new SearchRequest(\u0026#34;hotel\u0026#34;); request.source().query(QueryBuilders.multiMatchQuery(\u0026#34;如家\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;brand\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;)); SearchResponse response = client.search(request, RequestOptions.DEFAULT); SearchHits searchHits = response.getHits(); long total = searchHits.getTotalHits().value; System.out.println(total); SearchHit[] hits = searchHits.getHits(); for (SearchHit hit : hits) { String json = hit.getSourceAsString(); System.out.println(json); } } You can see a lot of code repetition here.

However, ES truly excels at search and data analysis.\nES queries are still implemented using JSON-style DSL.\nQuery Categories Common query types include:\nMatch All: Retrieves all data, typically for testing. E.g., match_all. Full-Text Search Queries: Uses an analyzer to tokenize user input, then matches against the inverted index. E.g.: match_query multi_match_query Exact Queries: Finds data based on precise term values, typically for keyword, numeric, date, or boolean fields. E.g.: ids range term Geographic (Geo) Queries: Queries based on latitude and longitude. E.g.: geo_distance geo_bounding_box Compound Queries: Combines the above simple query conditions to form complex queries. E.g.: bool function_score The query syntax is generally consistent:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 GET /indexName/_search { \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;QueryType\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;QueryCondition\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ConditionValue\u0026#34; } } } Match All The query type is match_all, with no query conditions.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 // Query all GET /indexName/_search { \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;match_all\u0026#34;: {} } } Full-Text Search Queries These queries tokenize user input and are commonly used for search box functionality. Since they match against terms, the fields involved in the search must also be tokenizable text type fields.\nCommon types:\nmatch: Single-field query. multi_match: Multi-field query; any field meeting the condition satisfies the query. match query syntax:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 # match GET /indexName/_search { \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;match\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;FIELD\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;TEXT\u0026#34; } } } # Example GET /hotel/_search { \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;match\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;all\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;外滩如家\u0026#34; } } } multi_match syntax:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 # multi_match GET /indexName/_search { \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;multi_match\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;TEXT\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;fields\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;FIELD1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;FIELD2\u0026#34;] } } } # Example GET /hotel/_search { \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;multi_match\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;外滩如家\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;fields\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;brand\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;business\u0026#34;] } } } Since brand, name, business values were copied to the all field when creating the index, the results of the two query types above are the same.\nHowever, searching more fields impacts performance more. Using copy_to and then a single-field query is recommended.\nExact Queries Exact queries do not tokenize the search condition. Common types include:\nterm: Searches based on an exact term value. range: Searches based on a range of values. Term Query The query condition must be a non-tokenized term. Only an exact match between the input and the value will satisfy the condition.\nSyntax:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 # term GET /indexName/_search { \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;term\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;FIELD\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;VALUE\u0026#34; } } } } Example:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 GET /hotel/_search { \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;term\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;city\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;上海\u0026#34; } } } } Range Query Range queries are typically used for filtering numeric types by a range. For example, filtering by price or date ranges.\nSyntax:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 # range GET /hotel/_search { \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;range\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;FIELD\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;gte\u0026#34;: 10, // gte means greater than or equal to, gt means greater than \u0026#34;lte\u0026#34;: 20 // lte means less than or equal to, lt means less than } } } } Example:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 GET /hotel/_search { \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;range\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;price\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;gte\u0026#34;: 1000, \u0026#34;lte\u0026#34;: 2000 } } } } Geographic Coordinate Queries These are essentially searches based on latitude and longitude. Official documentation: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/geo-queries.html Common scenarios: searching for nearby hotels, taxis, people, or restaurants.\nBounding Box Query geo_bounding_box query: searches for all documents whose coordinates fall within a specified rectangular area.\nRequires specifying the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right points.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 # geo_bounding_box GET /indexName/_search { \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;geo_bounding_box\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;FIELD\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;top_left\u0026#34;: { // Top-left point \u0026#34;lat\u0026#34;: 30, \u0026#34;lon\u0026#34;: 20 }, \u0026#34;bottom_right\u0026#34;: { // Bottom-right point \u0026#34;lat\u0026#34;: 31, \u0026#34;lon\u0026#34;: 21 } } } } } Proximity Query Also known as geo_distance query: searches for all documents within a specified distance from a given central point.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # geo_distance GET /indexName/_search { \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;geo_distance\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;distance\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;15km\u0026#34;, // Radius \u0026#34;FIELD\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;31, 21\u0026#34; // Center point } } } Example: Search for hotels within 15km of (31.21, 121.5).\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 GET /hotel/_search { \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;geo_distance\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;distance\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;15km\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;location\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;31.21, 121.5\u0026#34; } } } Compound Queries Combine simple queries to achieve more complex search logic. There are two common types:\nfunction score: A scoring function query that controls document relevance scores to influence ranking. bool query: A boolean query that combines multiple other queries using logical relationships to achieve complex searches. Relevance Scoring When using a match query, document results are scored based on their relevance to the search terms (_score), and returned in descending order of score, e.g.:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 [ { \u0026#34;_score\u0026#34; : 17.850193, \u0026#34;_source\u0026#34; : { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;虹桥如家酒店真不错\u0026#34;, } }, { \u0026#34;_score\u0026#34; : 12.259849, \u0026#34;_source\u0026#34; : { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;外滩如家酒店真不错\u0026#34;, } }, { \u0026#34;_score\u0026#34; : 11.91091, \u0026#34;_source\u0026#34; : { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;迪士尼如家酒店真不错\u0026#34;, } } ] In ES, the scoring algorithm used in earlier versions was TF-IDF.\nThe TF-IDF algorithm had a flaw: higher term frequency led to higher document scores, giving a single term too much influence. After version 5.1, the algorithm was changed to BM25, which gives a maximum limit to a single term\u0026rsquo;s score.\nFunction Score Query While the BM25 scoring function is generally reasonable, it may not align with product requirements. To control relevance scoring, you can use ES\u0026rsquo;s function_score query to modify a document\u0026rsquo;s relevance score and reorder results based on the new scores.\nStructure:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 # function score GET /indexName/_search { \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;function_score\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: {}, // Original query \u0026#34;functions\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;filter\u0026#34;: {}, // Filter condition \u0026#34;weight\u0026#34;: 1 // Score function } ], \u0026#34;boost_mode\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;multiply\u0026#34; // Operation mode } } } Original Query: Searches documents based on this condition and scores them using the BM25 algorithm (original query score). Filter Condition: Only documents matching this condition will be re-scored. Score Function: Documents matching the filter condition will be processed by this function to get a function score. There are four types of functions: weight: Function result is a constant. field_value_factor: Uses a field\u0026rsquo;s value in the document as the function result. random_score: Uses a random number as the function result. script_score: Custom scoring function algorithm. Operation Mode: The way the function score and the original query\u0026rsquo;s relevance score are combined. Includes: multiply: Multiplies the scores. replace: Replaces the query score with the function score. Others, such as: sum, avg, max, min. Example: Give \u0026ldquo;如家\u0026rdquo; (Rujia) brand hotels a higher rank.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 GET /hotel/_search { \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: { // Original query condition is any; added condition here for execution \u0026#34;function_score\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;term\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;city\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;上海\u0026#34; }}, \u0026#34;functions\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;filter\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;term\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;brand\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;如家\u0026#34; }}, \u0026#34;weight\u0026#34;: 10 } ], \u0026#34;boost_mode\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;multiply\u0026#34; } } } Boolean Query A boolean query combines one or more query clauses. Each clause is a sub-query, and they can be combined in the following ways:\nmust: All sub-queries must match, similar to \u0026ldquo;AND\u0026rdquo;. should: Sub-queries are optional matches, similar to \u0026ldquo;OR\u0026rdquo;. must_not: Sub-queries must not match, does not contribute to the score, similar to \u0026ldquo;NOT\u0026rdquo;. filter: Sub-queries must match, does not contribute to the score. For example, when searching for hotels, you might filter by region, brand, price, etc. Each different field requires a different query condition and method. To combine these multiple distinct queries, a bool query is necessary.\nFields contributing to scoring generally lead to slower query performance. For multi-condition queries, it\u0026rsquo;s recommended:\nKeyword searches in the search box are full-text searches, use must query, and contribute to scoring. Other filter conditions, use filter query, and do not contribute to scoring.

Fields that can be sorted include keyword type, numeric type, geographic coordinate type, date type, etc.\nStandard Field Sorting Sorting for keyword, numeric, and date types has largely the same syntax.\nSyntax:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 # sort_normal GET /indexName/_search { \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: { }, \u0026#34;sort\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;FIELD\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;order\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;desc\u0026#34; // Sort field, ASC, DESC } } ] } The sort condition is an array, allowing multiple sort conditions. They are applied in the declared order: if the first condition is equal, the second condition is used, and so on.\nExample: Hotel data sorted by user review in descending order, then by price in ascending order if reviews are the same.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 GET /hotel/_search { \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;match\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;city\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;上海\u0026#34; } }, \u0026#34;sort\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;score\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;order\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;desc\u0026#34; } }, { \u0026#34;price\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;order\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;asc\u0026#34; } } ] } // Or GET /hotel/_search { \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;match\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;city\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;上海\u0026#34; } }, \u0026#34;sort\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;score\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;desc\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;price\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;asc\u0026#34; } ] } Geographic Coordinate Sorting Syntax:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 # sort_geo GET /indexName/_search { \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: { }, \u0026#34;sort\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;_geo_distance\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;FIELD\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;lat\u0026#34;: 40, \u0026#34;lon\u0026#34;: -70 }, \u0026#34;order\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;asc\u0026#34;, // Sort order \u0026#34;unit\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;km\u0026#34; // Sort unit } } ] } Example: Sort hotels by distance (assuming location is 31.034661, 121.612282).\nGaode (Amap) to get lat/lon: https://lbs.amap.com/demo/jsapi-v2/example/map/click-to-get-lnglat/ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 GET /hotel/_search { \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;match_all\u0026#34;: {} }, \u0026#34;sort\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;_geo_distance\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;location\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;lat\u0026#34;: 31.034661, \u0026#34;lon\u0026#34;: 121.612282 }, \u0026#34;order\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;asc\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;unit\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;km\u0026#34; } } ] } Pagination ES by default only returns the top 10 documents. To query more data, you need to modify the pagination parameters. ES controls the paginated results returned by modifying the from and size parameters:\nfrom: The starting document index. size: The total number of documents to query. Similar to limit ?,? in MySQL.\nBasic Pagination The basic syntax is as follows:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 # Basic pagination GET /indexName/_search { \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: { }, \u0026#34;from\u0026#34;: 0, \u0026#34;size\u0026#34;: 10, \u0026#34;sort\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;FIELD\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;order\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;desc\u0026#34; } } ] } Deep Pagination Problem To query data from 990-1000, the statement would be:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 GET /hotel/_search { \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;match_all\u0026#34;: {} }, \u0026#34;from\u0026#34;: 990, \u0026#34;size\u0026#34;: 10, \u0026#34;sort\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;price\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;order\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;asc\u0026#34; } } ] } However, due to ES\u0026rsquo;s mechanism, pagination requires first querying documents from 0-1000, then taking documents from 990-1000 for display.\nIf ES is in a single-node setup, this has little impact. But in a clustered deployment, querying 1000 documents does not mean each node queries 200 documents, because node A\u0026rsquo;s 200 documents might rank outside the Top 1000 on node B.\nTo get the Top 1000, each node needs to query its own Top 1000, then results are aggregated, re-ranked, and finally truncated.\nQuerying Top 10000 or more can put significant pressure on memory and CPU. Therefore, ES restricts from + size from exceeding 10000.\nFor deep pagination, ES provides two solutions: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/paginate-search-results.html search after: Requires sorting during pagination. The principle is to query the next page\u0026rsquo;s data starting from the sort values of the last document on the previous page. Officially recommended. scroll: The principle is to create a snapshot of sorted document IDs in memory. Officially no longer recommended. Pagination Summary from + size:\nPros: Supports arbitrary page jumps. Cons: Deep pagination issues, default query limit (from + size) is 10000. Scenarios: Random pagination searches like Baidu, JD, Google, Taobao. search after:\nPros: No query limit (single query size does not exceed 10000). Cons: Can only query pages sequentially forward, does not support arbitrary page jumps. Scenarios: Searches without a random page jump requirement, e.g., scrolling down on a mobile phone. scroll:\nPros: No query limit (single query size does not exceed 10000). Cons: Incurs extra memory overhead, and search results are not real-time. Scenarios: Retrieving and migrating large amounts of data. Not recommended since ES 7.1; search after is suggested instead. Highlighting When searching content with a search engine, keywords often appear in a prominent color (e.g., red) for better visibility. This is highlighting, typically achieved by adding a tag (\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;) around all keywords in a document and applying CSS styles to that tag.\nSyntax:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 # Highlight GET /indexName/_search { \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;: { }, \u0026#34;highlight\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;fields\u0026#34;: { // Specify fields to highlight \u0026#34;FIELD\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;pre_tags\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, // Pre-tag for highlighting field \u0026#34;post_tags\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026#34; // Post-tag for highlighting field } } } } Notes:\nHighlighting applies to keywords, so the search condition must involve keywords, not range queries. By default, highlighted fields must be the same as the fields specified in the search; otherwise, highlighting won\u0026rsquo;t work.

It helps us quickly find what we need in massive datasets. Combined with Kibana, Logstash, and Beats, it forms the Elastic Stack (ELK). It\u0026rsquo;s widely used in log data analysis, real-time monitoring, and more.\nElasticsearch is the core of the Elastic Stack, handling data storage, search, and analysis.\nUnder the hood, Elasticsearch is built on Lucene, a Java search engine library.\nForward Index Traditional databases (like MySQL) use a forward index. Take this table:\nid title price 1 小米手机 3499 2 华为手机 4999 3 华为小米充电器 49 4 小米手环 239 For exact queries based on id, an index makes it super fast.\nBut for fuzzy queries on title, you\u0026rsquo;re stuck with a row-by-row scan. Here\u0026rsquo;s how it goes:\nUser searches for 手机 (phone), database condition %手机%. Fetch data row by row, e.g., the row with id 1. Check if the title in the data matches the condition. If it matches, keep it; otherwise, discard and move to the next row. As data grows, row-by-row scanning gets less and less efficient.\nInverted Index The inverted index concept is contrasted with forward indexes like those in MySQL.\nElasticsearch uses an inverted index. Key concepts:\nDocument: Each piece of data is a document. Term: Words derived from documents through semantic analysis. Building an inverted index is a specific way to process a forward index. The steps:\nTokenize each document\u0026rsquo;s data into individual terms using an algorithm. Create a table where each row includes the term, document ID(s) where it appears, position, etc. Since terms are unique, you can index them, perhaps using a hash table structure. For example, the table above could have an inverted index like this:\nTerm Doc ID 小米 (Xiaomi) 1, 3, 4 手机 (phone) 1, 2 华为 (Huawei) 2, 3 充电器 (charger) 3 手环 (band) 4 Inverted index search flow:\nUser searches for 小米手机 (Xiaomi phone). Tokenize the search query, getting 小米 (Xiaomi), 手机 (phone). Use terms to search the inverted index, getting doc IDs containing the terms: 1, 2, 3, 4. Use doc IDs to find the actual documents in the forward index. Document Elasticsearch is document-oriented. A document can be a product record, an order, or similar data from a database. Document data is serialized into JSON format and stored in Elasticsearch.\nThe JSON for the forward index table mentioned above would look like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;小米手机\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;price\u0026#34;: 3499 } { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: 2, \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;华为手机\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;price\u0026#34;: 4999 } { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: 3, \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;华为小米充电器\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;price\u0026#34;: 49 } { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: 4, \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;小米手环\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;price\u0026#34;: 299 } A JSON document contains many fields, similar to columns in a database.\nIndex and Mapping An index is a collection of documents of the same type.\nMapping defines the field constraints for documents within an index, similar to table structure constraints.\nYou can think of an index as a database table. Database tables have constraints defining their structure, field names, types, etc. Similarly, an index has a mapping, which describes the field constraints for its documents, much like a table\u0026rsquo;s schema.\nMySQL vs. Elasticsearch MySQL Elasticsearch Explanation Table Index An index is a collection of documents, similar to a database table. Row Document A document is a single piece of data, like a database row. All documents are in JSON format. Column Field A field is a key within a JSON document, similar to a database column. Schema Mapping Mapping defines constraints for documents within an index, like field type constraints. It\u0026rsquo;s similar to a database schema. SQL DSL DSL (Domain Specific Language) is Elasticsearch\u0026rsquo;s JSON-based query language used for CRUD operations. In enterprises, these two are often used together:\nFor write operations requiring high security, use MySQL. For search needs requiring high query performance, use Elasticsearch. Data synchronization between them, using some method, ensures consistency. Pros \u0026amp; Cons Forward Index:\nPros: Can create indexes on multiple fields. Searches and sorting based on indexed fields are very fast. Cons: Searching by non-indexed fields or partial terms within indexed fields requires a full table scan. Inverted Index:\nPros: Term-based and fuzzy searches are extremely fast. Cons: Can only create indexes on terms, not on entire fields directly. Cannot sort directly by fields. Installation Typically, Elasticsearch alone is sufficient. Kibana provides a visual interface for Elasticsearch, making it easier to learn and write DSL queries.\nElasticsearch To link Elasticsearch and Kibana containers, first create a network.\n1 docker network create es-net There are multiple ways to link containers, such as Docker Compose or direct IP (e.g., 172.17.0.1).\nPull Elasticsearch.\n1 docker pull elasticsearch:7.12.1 Single-node deployment.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 docker run -d \\ --name es \\ -e \u0026#34;ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m\u0026#34; \\ -e \u0026#34;discovery.type=single-node\u0026#34; \\ -v es-data:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data \\ -v es-plugins:/usr/share/elasticsearch/plugins \\ --privileged \\ --network es-net \\ -p 9200:9200 \\ -p 9300:9300 \\ elasticsearch:7.12.1 Remember to adjust mapping directories.

You can test with longer sentences to see the difference.\nExtend Dictionary With the internet\u0026rsquo;s evolution, new words constantly emerge that aren\u0026rsquo;t in existing vocabulary lists. Thus, these lists need continuous updates. To extend the IK Analyzer dictionary, simply modify the IKAnalyzer.cfg.xml file in the config directory within your IK Analyzer installation.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 \u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE properties SYSTEM \u0026#34;http://java.sun.com/dtd/properties.dtd\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;properties\u0026gt; \u0026lt;comment\u0026gt;IK Analyzer 扩展配置\u0026lt;/comment\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!--用户可以在这里配置自己的扩展字典 --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;entry key=\u0026#34;ext_dict\u0026#34;\u0026gt;ext.dic\u0026lt;/entry\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!--用户可以在这里配置自己的扩展停止词字典--\u0026gt; \u0026lt;entry key=\u0026#34;ext_stopwords\u0026#34;\u0026gt;stopwords.dic\u0026lt;/entry\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!--用户可以在这里配置远程扩展字典 --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- \u0026lt;entry key=\u0026#34;remote_ext_dict\u0026#34;\u0026gt;words_location\u0026lt;/entry\u0026gt; --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!--用户可以在这里配置远程扩展停止词字典--\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- \u0026lt;entry key=\u0026#34;remote_ext_stopwords\u0026#34;\u0026gt;words_location\u0026lt;/entry\u0026gt; --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/properties\u0026gt; As shown above, custom words go into ./ext.dic, and stop words into ./stopwords.dic.\nStop words are typically meaningless words like 的 (de), 啊 (a), etc. (common Chinese particles).\nAfter configuration, restart ES.\nDSL Index Operations An index is like a database table. Before storing data in ES, you must first create an \u0026ldquo;index\u0026rdquo; (like a database) and its \u0026ldquo;mapping\u0026rdquo; (like a table schema).\nMapping Properties Mapping defines constraints for documents within an index. Common mapping properties include:\ntype: Field data type. Common simple types include: String: text (tokenized text), keyword (exact values, e.g., brand, country, IP address). Numeric: long, integer, short, byte, double, float. Boolean: boolean. Date: date. Object: object. index: Whether to create an index for the field. Defaults to true. analyzer: Which analyzer to use. properties: Sub-fields of this field. Create Index Request method: PUT. Request path: /index-name (customizable). Request parameters: mapping definition. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 PUT /index-name { \u0026#34;mappings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;properties\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;field-name\u0026#34;:{ \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;text\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;analyzer\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ik_smart\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;field-name2\u0026#34;:{ \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;keyword\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;index\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;false\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;field-name3\u0026#34;:{ \u0026#34;properties\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;sub-field\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;keyword\u0026#34; } } }, // code } } } For example:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 # Create index PUT /hello { \u0026#34;mappings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;properties\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;info\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;text\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;analyzer\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ik_smart\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;email\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;keyword\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;index\u0026#34;: false }, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;properties\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;firstName\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;keyword\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;lastName\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;keyword\u0026#34; } } } } } } If the response is similar to below after running, it\u0026rsquo;s successful.\n1 2 3 4 5 { \u0026#34;acknowledged\u0026#34; : true, \u0026#34;shards_acknowledged\u0026#34; : true, \u0026#34;index\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;hello\u0026#34; } Get Index Request method: GET.

A year just flew by\u0026hellip;\nProblems A standalone Redis instance has several issues:\nData loss: Solution: Implement Redis persistence. Concurrency limits: Solution: Set up Master-Slave clusters for read/write splitting. Storage limits: Solution: Set up Sharded clusters using slot mechanisms for dynamic scaling. Fault recovery: Solution: Use Redis Sentinel for health monitoring and automatic recovery. Redis Persistence Redis offers two persistence options: RDB and AOF.\nRDB Persistence RDB stands for Redis Database Backup file, also known as a data snapshot. Simply put, it saves all memory data to disk. After a crash, Redis restores data by reading the snapshot file. These snapshots (RDB files) are saved in the working directory by default.\nRDB executes in these four scenarios:\nsave command: Immediate execution. Blocks the main process and all other commands. Use only during data migration. bgsave command: Asynchronous execution. Forks a child process to handle the RDB, allowing the main process to keep processing requests. Shutdown: Redis automatically runs a save command when stopping. Trigger conditions: Configured in the settings as follows: 1 2 3 4 # If at least 1 key changes within 900s, run bgsave. save \u0026#34;\u0026#34; disables RDB. save 900 1 save 300 10 save 60 10000 Other configurations:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 # Compress RDB? Recommended: no. CPU cost isn\u0026#39;t worth the disk savings. rdbcompression yes # RDB filename dbfilename dump.rdb # Directory for saving the file dir ./ RDB Principles When bgsave starts, it forks the main process to create a child process. Both share the same memory data. Once the fork is complete, the child process reads the memory and writes it to the RDB file.\nForking uses Copy-On-Write (COW) technology:\nWhen the main process performs a read, it accesses the shared memory. When the main process performs a write, it copies the data segment first and then executes the write. RDB Disadvantages:\nLong intervals between saves; data written between two RDB runs risks being lost. Forking, compression, and writing RDB files are resource-heavy. AOF Persistence AOF stands for Append Only File. Every write command processed by Redis is logged in the AOF file. Think of it as a command history log.\nAOF is disabled by default. Enable it in the config:\n1 2 3 4 # Enable AOF? Default: no appendonly yes # AOF filename appendfilename \u0026#34;appendonly.aof\u0026#34; The logging frequency can also be configured in redis.conf:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 # Log every write command immediately to the AOF file appendfsync always # Buffer writes, flush to disk every second. Default/Balanced option. appendfsync everysec # Buffer writes, let the OS decide when to flush to disk. appendfsync no Comparison of sync policies:\nOption Flush Timing Pros Cons always Sync flush High reliability, minimal loss High performance impact everysec Per-second flush Balanced performance Max 1s data loss no OS controlled Best performance Low reliability, potential high loss File Rewriting Since AOF logs every command, files grow much larger than RDB files. Also, AOF might log multiple writes to the same key, though only the last state matters. Running the bgrewriteaof command rewrites the AOF file using the minimum number of commands required to reach the current state.\nExample: Original commands:\n1 2 3 set num 123 set name jack set num 666 After rewrite:\n1 mset name jack num 666 Redis also triggers auto-rewrites based on thresholds in the config:\n1 2 3 4 # Trigger rewrite if AOF grows by this percentage since last rewrite auto-aof-rewrite-percentage 100 # Min AOF size to trigger a rewrite auto-aof-rewrite-min-size 64mb RDB vs AOF RDB and AOF both have pros and cons. For high data security, developers often use both together.\nRDB AOF Persistence Method Periodic full memory snapshots Logs every write command Data Integrity Incomplete; data lost between backups Mostly complete, depends on flush policy File Size Compressed, small Command logs, very large Recovery Speed Very fast Slow Recovery Priority Low (due to integrity) High (due to better integrity) Resource Usage High CPU/Memory during fork Low (mostly Disk I/O).\nNote: Rewrite uses significant CPU/RAM. Use Case Tolerable data loss (minutes), fast startup High data security requirements Redis Master-Slave Architecture A single Redis node has a concurrency ceiling. To scale, you need a Master-Slave cluster to implement read/write splitting.\nSetting up the Cluster Environment: CentOS 7\nBased on the diagram, we\u0026rsquo;ll deploy three nodes on one machine using ports 7001 (master), 7002, and 7003.\nFirst, create the directories:\n1 2 cd /tmp mkdir 7001 7002 7003 If you previously modified the config, revert to default RDB mode:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 # Enable RDB # save \u0026#34;\u0026#34; save 3600 1 save 300 100 save 60 10000 # Disable AOF appendonly no Copy the config file to each instance directory:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 # Option 1 cp redis-6.2.4/redis.conf 7001 cp redis-6.2.4/redis.conf 7002 cp redis-6.2.4/redis.conf 7003 # Option 2 echo 7001 7002 7003 | xargs -t -n 1 cp redis-6.2.4/redis.conf Modify the port and working directory for each instance (updates port and RDB save path):\n1 2 3 sed -i -e \u0026#39;s/6379/7001/g\u0026#39; -e \u0026#39;s/dir .\\//dir \\/tmp\\/7001\\//g\u0026#39; 7001/redis.conf sed -i -e \u0026#39;s/6379/7002/g\u0026#39; -e \u0026#39;s/dir .\\//dir \\/tmp\\/7002\\//g\u0026#39; 7002/redis.conf sed -i -e \u0026#39;s/6379/7003/g\u0026#39; -e \u0026#39;s/dir .\\//dir \\/tmp\\/7003\\//g\u0026#39; 7003/redis.conf Update the IP for each directory (replace ip_address with actual IP):\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 # Execute one by one sed -i \u0026#39;1a replica-announce-ip ip_address\u0026#39; 7001/redis.conf sed -i \u0026#39;1a replica-announce-ip ip_address\u0026#39; 7002/redis.conf sed -i \u0026#39;1a replica-announce-ip ip_address\u0026#39; 7003/redis.conf # Or use one-liner printf \u0026#39;%s\\n\u0026#39; 7001 7002 7003 | xargs -I{} -t sed -i \u0026#39;1a replica-announce-ip ip_address\u0026#39; {}/redis.conf Start the instances:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 # Instance 1 redis-server 7001/redis.conf # Instance 2 redis-server 7002/redis.conf # Instance 3 redis-server 7003/redis.conf Stop the instances:\n1 printf \u0026#39;%s\\n\u0026#39; 7001 7002 7003 | xargs -I{} -t redis-cli -p {} shutdown ","date":"2025-01-28T21:47:19+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/225/","title":"Redis Distributed Caching"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Musical Feelings Series Song Name Translation Link 僕が死のうと思ったのは I Once Thought About Ending It All https://blog.yexca.net/archives/214 あくあ色ぱれっと Aqua\u0026rsquo;s Palette https://blog.yexca.net/archives/219 恋の押し売り Forced Love https://blog.yexca.net/archives/220 17さいのうた 17-Year-Old\u0026rsquo;s Song This Article drop Falling in Love https://blog.yexca.net/archives/230 生きるを選んだ私へ To My Self Who Chose to Live https://blog.yexca.net/archives/239 rainy lady The Rain Hasn\u0026rsquo;t Cleared https://blog.yexca.net/archives/249 恋しくなったら手を叩こう Clap Your Hands if You Want to Fall in Love https://blog.yexca.net/archives/250 pris-magic! Pris-Magic! https://blog.yexca.net/archives/260 Introduction At first, I could only understand the part about the letter to the self. It felt like it matched where I was when I first heard it, so I kept it on repeat.\nWhen I started translating this song, and looking at my recent experiences, I realized I\u0026rsquo;m in a very similar state to what Yuika was feeling back then. My current self is just like this song: full of confusion. What kind of person will I become? What does the future look like? Where should I go?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s stay positive. Just like the lyrics say, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to accept myself, move past the confusion, and just find something I enjoy doing.\nFinally, thanks to those who encouraged me, and those who didn\u0026rsquo;t say much but supported me through their actions.\n2025.01.27 Sang this song. Didn\u0026rsquo;t take a photo because it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the original video; felt a bit meaningless. Since it mirrors my current mindset, I really felt that \u0026ldquo;lost in the future\u0026rdquo; vibe while singing. Putting it into words—or rather, singing it out—made things feel complicated, but it was a great experience.\n2025.05.26 Sang it again. Took a quick photo this time. Thinking about my own growth, it\u0026rsquo;s a truly strange and wonderful song.\nMusic Video Lyrics こんな私の未み熟じゅくなうたを　聴いてくれてどうも有難うね\nThank you for listening to such an immature song of mine.\nもう少しで私は未熟な大人に　なるみたいです\nIt seems I\u0026rsquo;ll be becoming an immature adult very soon.\nなんか笑っちゃうね\nIt\u0026rsquo;s kind of funny, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\n本当はね\nTo tell you the truth,\nもっと前を向けるようなうたを　書くつもりだったけど\nI intended to write a song that was more forward-looking.\n書けなくて\nBut I couldn\u0026rsquo;t write it.\n私はまだ　他の誰かを支えられるほど\nI\u0026rsquo;m not yet at the point where I can support someone else.\n強くなかったみたい　ごめんね\nI guess I wasn\u0026rsquo;t that strong.

Java system properties and command-line arguments also work.\nPriority: Command Line Args \u0026gt; Java System Properties \u0026gt; Properties Files \u0026gt; YML \u0026gt; YAML\nFor command line usage, first run the Maven package command, then execute from the command line:\n1 2 3 4 5 java -jar path_to_jar.jar # Java System Property, e.g., for port java -Dserver.port=9000 -jar path_to_jar.jar # Command Line Argument, e.g., for port java -jar path_to_jar.jar --server.port=9000 When packaging a SpringBoot project, you need the spring-boot-maven-plugin. (If you create a project from the official skeleton, this plugin is automatically included).\nBean Management Getting Beans For default singleton, non-lazy-loaded beans, Spring creates them all during startup and puts them in the IOC container. (If you use @Lazy, they\u0026rsquo;ll be instantiated on first use).\nIf you want to explicitly get these beans, you can do it like this:\nGet by name: 1 Object getBean(String name) Get by type: 1 \u0026lt;T\u0026gt; T getBean(Class\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; requiredType) Get by name and type (type conversion): 1 \u0026lt;T\u0026gt; T getBean(String name, Class\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; requiredType) To use this method, you first need to get the IOC container object:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 @Autowired private ApplicationContext applicationContext; //IOC container object public void testGetBean(){ // Get by bean name DeptController beanl = (DeptController) applicationContext.getBean(\u0026#34;deptController\u0026#34;); // Get by bean type DeptController bean2 = applicationContext.getBean(DeptController.class); // Get by bean name and type DeptController bean3 = applicationContext.getBean(\u0026#34;deptController\u0026#34;, DeptController.class); } Bean Scopes Spring supports five scopes. The last three are only active in a web environment.\nScope Description singleton Only one instance of the bean exists per container (singleton) prototype A new instance is created each time the bean is used (non-singleton) request A new instance is created for each request session A new instance is created for each session application A new instance is created for each application Use the @Scope annotation to set the scope:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 // Set to non-singleton @Scope(\u0026#34;prototype\u0026#34;) @RestController public class xxxController{ } In real-world development, most beans are singletons, meaning most beans don\u0026rsquo;t need the scope attribute configured.\nThird-Party Beans If the bean you want to manage comes from a third party (not custom-defined), you can\u0026rsquo;t use @Component or its derivatives. Instead, you\u0026rsquo;ll need the @Bean annotation. A good example is dom4j for parsing XML files.\n1 2 3 4 5 \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.dom4j\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;dom4j\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;2.1.3\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; Dependency as above.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 @SpringBootApplication public class xxxApplication{ @Bean // Hand the method\u0026#39;s return value to the IOC container to become an IOC bean public SAXReader saxReader(){ return new SAXReader(); } } However, for third-party beans, it\u0026rsquo;s a good practice to centralize their configuration. You can declare a configuration class using the @Configuration annotation.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 @Configuration public class CommonConfig { @Bean public SAXReader saxReader(){ return new SAXReader(); } } You can specify a bean\u0026rsquo;s name using the name or value attribute of the @Bean annotation. If not specified, the method name becomes the bean name by default. If a third-party bean depends on other beans, just declare them as method parameters in the bean definition method, and the container will autowire them by type.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 @Configuration public class CommonConfig { @Bean public SAXReader saxReader(XxService xxService){ return new SAXReader(); } } Starter Dependencies When developing directly with Spring, you need to pull in a bunch of dependencies and ensure version compatibility. With SpringBoot, you just need to include a \u0026lsquo;starter\u0026rsquo; dependency. The magic behind it is Maven\u0026rsquo;s transitive dependencies; all other required dependencies are automatically pulled in.\nAuto-Configuration SpringBoot\u0026rsquo;s auto-configuration means that when the Spring container starts, various configuration classes and bean objects are automatically added to the IOC container. This eliminates manual declarations, simplifying development and cutting down on tedious configuration.\nAt its core, a configuration class (@Configuration) is a @Component and thus also a bean in the container.\nSo, after pulling in a dependency, how do the configuration classes and beans defined within that JAR get loaded into the Spring IOC container?\n@ComponentScan You can use @ComponentScan to specify which packages to scan. For example, if you imported com.example.\n1 2 @SpringBootApplication @ComponentScan({\u0026#34;net.yexca\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;com.example\u0026#34;}) However, if you\u0026rsquo;re pulling in many third-party dependencies, you\u0026rsquo;d have to list a lot of packages above, and large-scale scanning can impact performance.\n@Import You can import regular classes, configuration classes, and ImportSelector interface implementations.\nRegular Classes 1 2 @Import(TokenParser.class) // Import a regular class @SpringBootApplication Configuration Classes Configuration class content:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 @Configuration public class HeaderConfig { @Bean public HeaderParser headerParser(){ return new HeaderParser(); } @Bean public HeaderGenerator headerGenerator(){ return new HeaderGenerator(); } } Startup class:\n1 2 @Import(HeaderConfig.class) // Import a configuration class @SpringBootApplication ImportSelector Implementations ImportSelector interface implementation content:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 public class MyImportSelector implements ImportSelector { public String[] selectImports(AnnotationMetadata importingClassMetadata) { // Returns a string array (array containing fully qualified class names) return new String[]{\u0026#34;com.example.HeaderConfig\u0026#34;}; } } Startup class:\n1 2 @Import(MyImportSelector.class) // Import an ImportSelector implementation class @SpringBootApplication @EnableXxxxx The @Import approach above requires you to first know exactly which config classes or beans are in the third-party dependency. Instead, third-party dependencies can offer @EnableXxxxx annotations. These encapsulate @Import to provide common beans, so you just need to use @EnableXxxxx.\nFor instance, let\u0026rsquo;s wrap the previous @Import config class with an @EnableHeaderConfig annotation:\n1 2 3 4 5 @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target(ElementType.TYPE) @Import(MyImportSelector.class)// Specify which bean objects or config classes to import public @interface EnableHeaderConfig { } Then, simply add the @EnableHeaderConfig annotation to your startup class to import the relevant beans.\n1 2 @EnableHeaderConfig // Use the Enable-prefixed annotation provided by the third-party dependency @SpringBootApplication This is also the approach SpringBoot itself uses.\nSpringBoot\u0026rsquo;s Auto-Configuration Inside the @SpringBootApplication annotation, you\u0026rsquo;ll find @EnableAutoConfiguration. This, in turn, @Imports AutoConfigurationImportSelector.class, an implementation of the ImportSelector interface.\nThe selectImports() method is overridden in this implementation class:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 public String[] selectImports(AnnotationMetadata annotationMetadata) { if (!this.isEnabled(annotationMetadata)) { return NO_IMPORTS; } else { // Get the collection of auto-configuration class info AutoConfigurationEntry autoConfigurationEntry = this.getAutoConfigurationEntry(annotationMetadata); return StringUtils.toStringArray(autoConfigurationEntry.getConfigurations()); } } It calls getAutoConfigurationEntry() to fetch the collection of auto-configuration class info:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 protected AutoConfigurationEntry getAutoConfigurationEntry(AnnotationMetadata annotationMetadata) { if (!this.isEnabled(annotationMetadata)) { return EMPTY_ENTRY; } else { AnnotationAttributes attributes = this.getAttributes(annotationMetadata); // Get the collection of all auto-configuration classes configured in the properties file List\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; configurations = this.getCandidateConfigurations(annotationMetadata, attributes); configurations = this.removeDuplicates(configurations); Set\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; exclusions = this.getExclusions(annotationMetadata, attributes); this.checkExcludedClasses(configurations, exclusions); configurations.removeAll(exclusions); configurations = this.getConfigurationClassFilter().filter(configurations); this.fireAutoConfigurationImportEvents(configurations, exclusions); return new AutoConfigurationEntry(configurations, exclusions); } } Specifically, the getCandidateConfigurations(annotationMetadata, attributes) method retrieves all auto-configuration classes configured in the properties files:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 protected List\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; getCandidateConfigurations(AnnotationMetadata metadata, AnnotationAttributes attributes) { List\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; configurations = new ArrayList(SpringFactoriesLoader.loadFactoryNames(this.getSpringFactoriesLoaderFactoryClass(), this.getBeanClassLoader())); ImportCandidates.load(AutoConfiguration.class, this.getBeanClassLoader()).forEach(configurations::add); Assert.notEmpty(configurations, \u0026#34;No auto configuration classes found in META-INF/spring.factories nor in META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports. If you are using a custom packaging, make sure that file is correct.\u0026#34;); return configurations; } As you can see, it fetches the collection of configuration classes from META-INF/spring.factories and META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports files.\nThese two files are typically found within the starter dependencies you include.\nSo, when a SpringBoot application starts, it loads the configuration classes defined in these files. These configuration class details (fully qualified names) are then encapsulated into a String array, and finally, all these configuration classes are loaded into Spring\u0026rsquo;s IOC container via the @Import annotation, managed by the IOC container.\n@Conditional With so many configuration classes, will every single bean be registered in the IOC container? Nope. The @Conditional annotation allows bean objects to be wired based on specific conditions.\n@Conditional is a parent annotation with many sub-annotations.\n@ConditionalOnClass Registers the bean into the IOC container ONLY if the corresponding bytecode file exists in the environment.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 @Configuration public class HeaderConfig { @Bean // The bean is added to the IOC container only if the specified class exists in the environment @ConditionalOnClass(name=\u0026#34;io.jsonwebtoken.Jwts\u0026#34;) public HeaderParser headerParser(){ return new HeaderParser(); } } The bean above will only be injected into the IOC container if the JWT token dependency is present.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 \u0026lt;!--JWT Token--\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;io.jsonwebtoken\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;jjwt\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;0.9.1\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; Testing:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 @SpringBootTest public class AutoConfigurationTests { @Autowired private ApplicationContext applicationContext; @Test public void testHeaderParser(){ System.out.println(applicationContext.getBean(HeaderParser.class)); } } @ConditionalOnMissingBean Registers the bean into the IOC container ONLY if there\u0026rsquo;s no corresponding bean (by type or name) in the environment.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 @Configuration public class HeaderConfig { @Bean @ConditionalOnMissingBean // The bean is added to the IOC container only if a bean of this type does not exist public HeaderParser headerParser(){ return new HeaderParser(); } } The above will create the bean only if there isn\u0026rsquo;t already a HeaderConfig type bean in the IOC container.\nYou can also specify another bean\u0026rsquo;s name in the annotation:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 @Configuration public class HeaderConfig { @Bean // The bean is added to the IOC container only if a bean with the specified name does not exist @ConditionalOnMissingBean(name=\u0026#34;deptController2\u0026#34;) public HeaderParser headerParser(){ return new HeaderParser(); } } In the example above, the HeaderConfig object will only be registered into the IOC if a bean named deptController2 doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist.\nYou can also specify a type:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 @Configuration public class HeaderConfig { @Bean // The bean is added to the IOC container only if a bean of the specified type does not exist @ConditionalOnMissingBean(HeaderConfig.class) public HeaderParser headerParser(){ return new HeaderParser(); } } Running the example above and trying to call this bean would throw a NoSuchBeanDefinitionException. Since @Configuration implies @Component, a HeaderConfig bean is automatically created, preventing the HeaderParser bean from being created by this condition.\n@ConditionalOnProperty Registers the bean into the IOC container ONLY if the specified property and value exist in the configuration file.\nConfiguration File:\n1 name: header Configuration Class:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 @Configuration public class HeaderConfig { @Bean // The bean is added to the IOC container only if the specified property name and value exist in the configuration file @ConditionalOnProperty(name =\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;,havingValue = \u0026#34;header\u0026#34;) public HeaderParser headerParser(){ return new HeaderParser(); } } Custom Starter Dependencies Let\u0026rsquo;s say you want to build a custom starter dependency for Alibaba Cloud OSS.\nFirst, naming conventions: Official SpringBoot starters are named spring-boot-starter-xxx, while third-party ones are xxx-spring-boot-starter.\nNext, modules: You\u0026rsquo;ll typically define two modules following a standard pattern:\nThe starter module: This handles dependency management, bundling all necessary development dependencies into the starter. The autoconfigure module: This is where auto-configuration logic resides. Once these two modules are set up, other projects just need to include the starter dependency, and the autoconfigure module will be transitively pulled in.\nModule POM Files aliyun-oss-spring-boot-starter Module:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 \u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34;

These operations either all succeed together or all fail together.\nOperations:\nStart Transaction: Begin the set of operations. (start transaction / begin) Commit Transaction: Finalize the operations if all succeed. (commit) Rollback Transaction: Revert all operations if any step fails. (rollback) Assume you need to delete a department and then delete all employees in that department:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 @Service public class DeptServiceImpl implements DeptService{ @Autowired private DeptMapper deptMapper; @Autowired private EmpMapper empMapper; @Override public void delete(Integer id）{ // 1.

Delete employees under this department id empMapper.deleteByDetId(id); } } In the example above, you\u0026rsquo;d end up with employees belonging to a non-existent department, causing data inconsistency.\nSpring Transaction Management Annotation: @Transactional.\nPlacement: Service layer methods, classes, or interfaces.\nWhat it does: Hands over the method to Spring for transaction management. It starts a transaction before execution, commits upon successful completion, and rolls back if an exception occurs.\nUpdated method:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 @Service public class DeptServiceImpl implements DeptService{ @Autowired private DeptMapper deptMapper; @Autowired private EmpMapper empMapper; @Transactional // Managed by Spring @Override public void delete(Integer id）{ // 1.

Spring AOP is an advanced Spring framework tech, primarily using the underlying dynamic proxy mechanism to program specific methods while managing bean objects.\nCounting Method Execution Time Importing Dependencies 1 2 3 4 \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.boot\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-boot-starter-aop\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; Writing AOP Code Write AOP code to program specific methods based on business needs.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 @Slf4j @Component @Aspect // AOP Class public class TimeAspect { // Pointcut expression @Around(\u0026#34;execution(* net.yexca.service.*.*(..))\u0026#34;) public Object recordTime(ProceedingJoinPoint proceedingJoinPoint) throws Throwable { long begin = System.currentTimeMillis(); // Call the original method Object object = proceedingJoinPoint.proceed(); long end = System.currentTimeMillis(); log.info(proceedingJoinPoint.getSignature() + \u0026#34; method execution time: {}ms\u0026#34;, end-begin); return object; } } Common AOP use cases include logging operations, access control, and transaction management.\nCore Concepts Join Point: A method that can be controlled by AOP (implicitly contains execution-related info).\nAdvice: Refers to the repetitive logic, or common functionality (ultimately implemented as a method).\nPointcut: Conditions for matching join points. Advice is applied only when a pointcut method executes.\nAspect: Describes the relationship between advice and pointcut (Advice + Pointcut).\nTarget Object: The object to which the advice is applied.\nIn the example above, all methods of the unwritten Service are join points. Methods selected by the pointcut expression are pointcuts. The recordTime method in the AOP class is the advice. The @Around annotation combined with the advice forms an aspect, and the TimeAspect class is called the aspect class.\nAdvice Advice Types @Around: Around advice. The advice method annotated with this executes both before and after the target method.\n@Before: Before advice. The advice method annotated with this executes before the target method.\n@After: After (finally) advice. The advice method annotated with this executes after the target method, regardless of whether an exception occurred.\n@AfterReturning: After returning advice. The advice method annotated with this executes after the target method returns normally (no exception).\n@AfterThrowing: After throwing advice. The advice method annotated with this executes if the target method throws an exception.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 @Component @Aspect public class MyAspect { @Before(\u0026#34;execution(* net.yexca.service.impl.*(..))\u0026#34;) public void before(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;Before\u0026#34;); } @Around(\u0026#34;execution(* net.yexca.service.impl.*(..))\u0026#34;) public Object around(ProceedingJoinPoint proceedingJoinPoint) throws Throwable { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Around before\u0026#34;); Object result = proceedingJoinPoint.proceed(); System.out.println(\u0026#34;Around after\u0026#34;); return result; } @After(\u0026#34;execution(* net.yexca.service.impl.*(..))\u0026#34;) public void after(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;After\u0026#34;); } @AfterReturning(\u0026#34;execution(* net.yexca.service.impl.*(..))\u0026#34;) public void afterRetruning(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;AfterReturning\u0026#34;); } @AfterThrowing(\u0026#34;execution(* net.yexca.service.impl.*(..))\u0026#34;) public void afterThrowing(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;AfterThrowing\u0026#34;); } } @Around advice needs to manually call ProceedingJoinPoint.proceed() for the original method to execute. Other advice types don\u0026rsquo;t need to consider target method execution.\nThe return type of an @Around advice method must be Object to receive the return value of the original method.\nThe pointcut expressions for the 5 annotations above are identical and can be extracted, as shown below:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 public class MyAspect { @Pointcut(\u0026#34;execution(* net.yexca.service.impl.*(..))\u0026#34;) public void pt(){} @Before(\u0026#34;pt()\u0026#34;) public void before(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;Before\u0026#34;); } } If the pt() method has public access, it can be referenced in other classes.\nAdvice Order When multiple aspects\u0026rsquo; pointcuts match the same target method, multiple advice methods will execute when the target method runs.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 net: yexca: aop: - MyAspect1 - MyAspect2 - MyAspect3 Suppose three AOP classes all select the same method. Among different aspect classes, the default order is alphabetical by aspect class name.\nAdvice methods before the target method: those with earlier alphabetical ranking execute first. Advice methods after the target method: those with later alphabetical ranking execute first. Assuming three AOP classes have both @Before and @After, the execution order is:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 MyAspect1 before MyAspect2 before MyAspect3 before MyAspect3 after MyAspect2 after MyAspect1 after You can use the @Order(num) annotation on the aspect class to control the order. A smaller num means earlier execution. The execution order for @Before and @After remains the same as described above.\nPointcut Expressions An expression describing pointcut methods, primarily used to determine which methods in a project need advice.\nCommon forms include execution(...) which matches based on method signatures, and annotation which matches based on annotations.\nexecution Mainly matches based on method return type, package name, class name, method name, method parameters, etc. The syntax is:\n1 execution(AccessModifier ReturnType PackageName.ClassName.MethodName(MethodParameters) throws Exception) The AccessModifier, PackageName.ClassName, and throws Exception can be omitted, but it\u0026rsquo;s not recommended to omit PackageName.ClassName.\nWildcards can also be used to describe pointcuts:\n*: A single arbitrary character. Can match any return type, package name, class name, method name, any single parameter type, or part of a package, class, or method name. 1 execution(* com.*.service.*.update*(*)) ..: Multiple consecutive arbitrary characters. Can match any level of package, or any type and number of parameters. 1 execution(* com.yexca..service.*(..)) You can also use \u0026amp;\u0026amp;, ||, ! to combine more complex pointcut expressions.\nWriting Suggestions Standardize all business method names as much as possible for easier pointcut expression matching. Describe pointcut methods usually based on interfaces rather than concrete implementations, enhancing extensibility. Narrow the pointcut matching scope as much as possible while still meeting business requirements. @annotation The @annotation pointcut expression is used to match methods marked with a specific annotation. You need to define a custom annotation first.\n1 2 3 4 @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target(ElementType.METHOD) public @interface MyLog { } Then add this annotation to the method, and in the AOP class method, use:\n1 @Before(\u0026#34;@annotation(net.yexca.aop.MyLog)\u0026#34;) Join Point In Spring, JoinPoint abstracts the concept of a join point. It allows you to obtain information related to method execution.\nFor @Around advice, you must use ProceedingJoinPoint to get join point info. For the other four advice types, you must use JoinPoint to get join point info; it\u0026rsquo;s the parent class of ProceedingJoinPoint. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 public Object recordTime(ProceedingJoinPoint proceedingJoinPoint) throws Throwable { // Get the target object\u0026#39;s class name String className = proceedingJoinPoint.getTarget().getClass().getName(); // Get the target method\u0026#39;s name String methodNAme = proceedingJoinPoint.getSignature().getName(); // Get the parameters passed during target method execution Object[] args = proceedingJoinPoint.getArgs(); // Call the original method Object object = proceedingJoinPoint.proceed(); return object; } ","date":"2025-01-21T16:05:57+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/221/","title":"Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash Sound Impressions Series Song Title Translation Link 僕が死のうと思ったのは I Wanted to Die https://blog.yexca.net/archives/214 あくあ色ぱれっと Aqua-colored Palette https://blog.yexca.net/archives/219 恋の押し売り Love\u0026rsquo;s Hard Sell This Article 17さいのうた 17-Year-Old\u0026rsquo;s Song https://blog.yexca.net/archives/224 drop Drop https://blog.yexca.net/archives/230 生きるを選んだ私へ To the Me Who Chose to Live https://blog.yexca.net/archives/239 rainy lady Rainy Lady https://blog.yexca.net/archives/249 恋しくなったら手を叩こう If You Get Lonely, Clap Your Hands https://blog.yexca.net/archives/250 pris-magic!

Prism Magic! https://blog.yexca.net/archives/260 Intro My initial pick for the second song was my 2024 Song of the Year. But then an Aqua song came on, and this one clicked. I\u0026rsquo;d been listening to it because a middle section kind of mirrored my own life. After a deep dive into the translation, it hit me: this is the origin of the \u0026ldquo;dyed in Aqua\u0026rsquo;s colors\u0026rdquo; meme! (I heard \u0026ldquo;want to be dyed in Aqua\u0026rsquo;s colors\u0026rdquo; at C105 and actually thought it was from \u0026lsquo;Kimi-iro ni Somaru\u0026rsquo;).\nWhile thinking about the fourth song, I realized this one was actually my 2023 Song of the Year. No biggie, let\u0026rsquo;s just kick things off with my YouTube history — consider it my first \u0026lsquo;Song of the Year\u0026rsquo;.\nThough similar experiences got me listening to and slowly liking Aqua, honestly, my \u0026ldquo;Because you\u0026rsquo;re here, I can always do my best\u0026rdquo; moment actually came from Warma. Writing this, I suddenly realized what truly influenced me, and why things are the way they are now. But just like how this song brought change, my current confusion will definitely find a way to resolve itself.\nI held back from elaborating further; it\u0026rsquo;s a joyful track. For an idol, this song is pure fire, absolutely perfect for that path. Plus, the lyrics aren\u0026rsquo;t too complex (for non-native speakers), even I can get them (doge).\nI only got into Aqua last year (2024). Hearing this song constantly (during 3D streams), I figured it came after she’d built up some experience, a powerhouse track that just topped the charts. Turns out, it was a debut peak! (\u0026lsquo;For the Win\u0026rsquo; was a Bilibili project, so I\u0026rsquo;ll skip that one for now.) All her subsequent idol-style songs were great, actually got me into that whole idol vibe. It even got me into idol concerts (though I\u0026rsquo;m less keen now after Aqua\u0026rsquo;s graduation).\nAlso, my translations might differ from others because I often inject my own feelings. So some parts aren\u0026rsquo;t a direct literal translation of the lyrics (same deal with the previous song ). This\u0026rsquo;ll be even clearer in the translation for my possibly next 2024 Song of the Year. Just copying a standard translation feels kinda pointless; when it\u0026rsquo;s something I truly love, I want to leave my own mark (dye it my color).\nAnyway, I also want to be dyed in Aqua\u0026rsquo;s colors! She\u0026rsquo;s one of my top three favorites, after all ~~ (Sucks I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get her standee at C105, or Yuuki\u0026rsquo;s either 😭)~~.\n2025.01.27 Sang this song. While singing, I thought of Aqua\u0026rsquo;s cover of Prideful Idol . It was a pretty unique experience. 2025.05.26 Sang it again (though I did sing it once in VRChat before). Still love \u0026lsquo;Because you\u0026rsquo;re here, I could walk this far; without you, I can\u0026rsquo;t even see what\u0026rsquo;s ahead.\u0026rsquo; It\u0026rsquo;s truly energizing when you\u0026rsquo;re feeling down and find someone who inspires you, or a goal you really want to achieve.\nSong Video Bilibili\u0026rsquo;s embed experience isn\u0026rsquo;t great, so I\u0026rsquo;ve switched to YouTube.

It ends when either side disconnects. A single session can include multiple requests and responses.\nSession Tracking: A method to maintain browser state. The server needs to identify if multiple requests come from the same browser to share data across these requests within the same session.\nSession Tracking Solutions:\nClient-side Session Tracking: Cookie Server-side Session Tracking: Session Token-based Solutions Cookie Cookie is an HTTP-supported tech. The first time a browser visits, the server sets a Cookie in the response header: Set-Cookie: your_cookie. The browser automatically stores this Cookie locally and sends it in the request header (Cookie: your_cookie) on subsequent visits.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 @RestController public class SessionController { // Set Cookie @GetMapping(\u0026#34;/c1\u0026#34;) public Result cookie1(HttpServletResponse response){ response.addCookie(new Cookie(\u0026#34;login_name\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;yexca\u0026#34;)); return Result.success(); } // Get Cookie @GetMapping(\u0026#34;/c2\u0026#34;) public Result cookie2(HttpServletRequest request){ Cookie[] cookies = request.getCookies(); for (Cookie c : cookies){ if(c.getName().equals(\u0026#34;login_name\u0026#34;)){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;login_name:\u0026#34;+c.getValue()); } } return Result.success(); } } But mobile clients can\u0026rsquo;t use Cookies, and Cookies don\u0026rsquo;t work cross-domain.\nSame Domain: Same protocol, IP/domain, port.\nSession Implemented based on Cookies. The first browser request generates a Session, and the response header returns the Session ID Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=session_id. The browser then automatically includes this ID in subsequent requests.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 @RestController public class SessionController { // Store value in HttpSession @GetMapping(\u0026#34;/s1\u0026#34;) public Result session1(HttpSession session){ log.info(\u0026#34;HttpSession_set:{}\u0026#34;, session.hashCode()); session.setAttribute(\u0026#34;login_user\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;yexca\u0026#34;); return Result.success(); } // Get value from HttpSession @GetMapping(\u0026#34;/s2\u0026#34;) public Result session2(HttpServletRequest request){ HttpSession session = request.getSession(); log.info(\u0026#34;HttpSession_get:{}\u0026#34;, session.hashCode()); Object loginUser = session.getAttribute(\u0026#34;login_user\u0026#34;); log.info(\u0026#34;loginUser:{}\u0026#34;, loginUser); return Result.success(); } } The issue with Session arises when using load balancing with multiple servers. If server one handles the first response and server two handles the second, server two won\u0026rsquo;t have the Session, making it unusable.\nJWT Tokens Token-based tech supports PCs and mobile devices. It solves authentication issues in clustered environments, reduces server storage pressure, but requires custom implementation.\nJWT, or JSON Web Token. Official website: https://jwt.io/ . It defines a compact, self-contained format for securely transmitting information between parties as JSON objects. Thanks to digital signatures, this information is reliable.\nStructure:\nFirst Part: Header, records token type, signing algorithm, etc. Second Part: Payload, records custom information, default information, etc. Third Part: Signature, prevents Token tampering and ensures security. It\u0026rsquo;s calculated from the Header, Payload, and a secret key using a specified signing algorithm.

Later, if you add an SMS service or a loyalty points service, you\u0026rsquo;d have to modify the payment code each time. This violates the Open/Closed Principle . Plus, you can\u0026rsquo;t do anything else until the request returns, which wastes performance.\nProblems: High coupling, performance degradation, resource waste, cascading failures (if a provider service goes down, all calling services fail too, like dominoes, quickly bringing down the entire microservice cluster).\nAsynchronous Call Solutions Asynchronous calls are often implemented using an event-driven pattern.\nUser payment request -\u0026gt; Payment Service -\u0026gt; Broker. The payment service then completes and responds, and the Broker notifies the order service, warehouse service, and SMS service.\nPros: Service decoupling, improved performance and throughput, loose coupling (fault isolation), traffic shaping/spike reduction.\nCons: Relies on the Broker\u0026rsquo;s reliability, security, and throughput. The architecture becomes more complex, business flows aren\u0026rsquo;t always clear, and tracing/management can be harder.\nMQ Message Queue. Literally, a queue for messages.

Message received: 【hello, rabbitmq!】 Clearly, this approach is a bit cumbersome.\nSpringAMQP SpringAMQP is a template wrapper around RabbitMQ. It also leverages Spring Boot for auto-configuration, making it super convenient to use.\nAMQP Advanced Message Queuing Protocol, an open standard for passing business messages between applications. This protocol is language and platform-agnostic, which aligns well with microservices\u0026rsquo; independence requirements.\nSpring AMQP Spring AMQP defines a set of APIs based on the AMQP protocol, providing templates for sending and receiving messages. It includes two parts: spring-amqp for basic abstractions, and spring-rabbit as the default underlying implementation.\nIt can automatically declare queues, exchanges, and their bindings, and supports annotation-based listener patterns for asynchronous message reception.\nBasic Queue Model First, add the dependency in your parent project:\n1 2 3 4 5 \u0026lt;!--AMQP dependency, includes RabbitMQ--\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.boot\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-boot-starter-amqp\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; Publisher (Sending Messages) Configure application.yml:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 spring: rabbitmq: host: localhost # Hostname port: 5672 # Port virtual-host: / # Virtual host username: admin # Username password: admin # Password Use RabbitTemplate to send messages:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 @RunWith(SpringRunner.class) @SpringBootTest public class SpringamqpTest { @Autowired private RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate; @Test public void testSimpleQueue(){ // Queue name String queueName = \u0026#34;hello.queue\u0026#34;; // Message String msg = \u0026#34;Hello Spring ampq\u0026#34;; // Send rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend(queueName,msg); } } Consumer (Receiving Messages) Same application.yml config as above.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 spring: rabbitmq: host: localhost # Hostname port: 5672 # Port virtual-host: / # Virtual host username: admin # Username password: admin # Password Create a new SpringRabbitListener class:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 @Component public class SpringRabbitListener { @RabbitListener(queues = \u0026#34;hello.queue\u0026#34;) public void listenSimpleQueue(String msg){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;Received message: \u0026#34; + msg); } } Work Queues (Task Queues) Also known as Task Queues. This model can boost message processing speed and prevent queue buildup.\npublisher -\u0026gt; queue -\u0026gt; consumer1 and consumer2 and \u0026hellip;\nPublisher (Sending Messages) Define a method to send 50 messages per second:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 public class SpringamqpTest { @Test public void testWorkQueue() throws InterruptedException { String queueName = \u0026#34;hello.queue\u0026#34;; String msg = \u0026#34;Hello Spring ampq...\u0026#34;; for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; 50; i++) { rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend(queueName, msg + i); // Sleep 20ms, sending 50 messages per second Thread.sleep(20); } } } Consumer (Receiving Messages) Create two consumers bound to the same queue:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 @Component public class SpringRabbitListener { @RabbitListener(queues = \u0026#34;hello.queue\u0026#34;) public void listenSimpleQueue1(String msg) throws InterruptedException { System.out.println(\u0026#34;1 received message: \u0026#34; + msg); // Processes 40 messages per second Thread.sleep(25); } @RabbitListener(queues = \u0026#34;hello.queue\u0026#34;) public void listenSimpleQueue2(String msg) throws InterruptedException { // Using System.err to output red messages System.err.println(\u0026#34;2 received message: \u0026#34; + msg); // Processes 5 messages per second Thread.sleep(200); } } Testing Run consumers first, then the publisher to send messages.\nFrom the output, you\u0026rsquo;ll see both consumers receive half the messages. This means messages are evenly distributed among consumers, without considering their processing capacity. Clearly, that\u0026rsquo;s an issue.\nPrefetch Modify application.yml to set the prefetch value, which controls the prefetch message limit (default is unlimited).\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 spring: rabbitmq: host: localhost # Hostname port: 5672 # Port virtual-host: / # Virtual host username: admin # Username password: admin # Password listener: simple: # Only fetches one message at a time; must process it before fetching the next prefetch: 1 Retesting shows improved execution efficiency.\nPublish/Subscribe Model The Publish/Subscribe model adds an exchange, allowing the same message to be sent to all subscribers.\npublisher -\u0026gt; exchange -\u0026gt; queue1 and queue2 queue1 -\u0026gt; consumer1 and consumer2 queue2 -\u0026gt; consumer3\nCommon exchanges include:\nFanout: Broadcast Direct: Routing Topic: Topic Exchanges route messages but don\u0026rsquo;t store them. If routing fails, the message is lost.\nFanout (Broadcast) A Fanout exchange broadcasts received messages to every bound queue.\nIn the consumer, create a config class to declare queues and exchanges:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 @Configuration public class FanoutConfig { /** * Declare exchange * @return */ @Bean public FanoutExchange fanoutExchange(){ return new FanoutExchange(\u0026#34;hello.fanout\u0026#34;); } /** * First queue * @return */ @Bean public Queue fanoutQueue1(){ return new Queue(\u0026#34;fanout.queue1\u0026#34;); } /** * Bind first queue to exchange * @param fanoutQueue1 * @param fanoutExchange * @return */ @Bean public Binding bindingQueue1(Queue fanoutQueue1, FanoutExchange fanoutExchange){ return BindingBuilder.bind(fanoutQueue1).to(fanoutExchange); } /** * Second queue * @return */ @Bean public Queue fanoutQueue2(){ return new Queue(\u0026#34;fanout.queue2\u0026#34;); } /** * Bind second queue to exchange * @param fanoutQueue2 * @param fanoutExchange * @return */ @Bean public Binding bindingQueue2(Queue fanoutQueue2, FanoutExchange fanoutExchange){ return BindingBuilder.bind(fanoutQueue2).to(fanoutExchange); } } Message Sending\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 public class SpringamqpTest { @Test public void testFanoutExchange(){ // Exchange String exchangeName = \u0026#34;hello.fanout\u0026#34;; // Message String msg = \u0026#34;hello, everyone\u0026#34;; rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend(exchangeName,\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,msg); } } The empty routingkey in the middle will be used in the next two models.\nMessage Reception\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 @Component public class SpringRabbitListener { @RabbitListener(queues = \u0026#34;fanout.queue1\u0026#34;) public void listenFanoutQueue1(String msg){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;Fanout1 received message: \u0026#34; + msg); } @RabbitListener(queues = \u0026#34;fanout.queue2\u0026#34;) public void listenFanoutQueue2(String msg){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;Fanout2 received message: \u0026#34; + msg); } } Direct (Routing) A Direct Exchange routes received messages to specific queues based on rules, hence \u0026lsquo;routing mode\u0026rsquo;.\nQueues bind to exchanges with a Routingkey. Senders must also specify the message\u0026rsquo;s Routingkey. Messages are only received if the queue\u0026rsquo;s Routingkey and the message\u0026rsquo;s Routingkey match exactly.\nHere, we\u0026rsquo;ll use annotations to declare queues and exchanges, no config class needed.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 @Component public class SpringRabbitListener { @RabbitListener(bindings = @QueueBinding( value = @Queue(name = \u0026#34;direct.queue1\u0026#34;), // exchange = @Exchange(name = \u0026#34;hello.direct\u0026#34;, type = ExchangeTypes.DIRECT), // Since the default type is Direct, it can be omitted exchange = @Exchange(name = \u0026#34;hello.direct\u0026#34;), key = {\u0026#34;red\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;warma\u0026#34;} )) public void listenDirectQueue1(String msg){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;1 received message: \u0026#34; + msg); } @RabbitListener(bindings = @QueueBinding( value = @Queue(name = \u0026#34;direct.queue2\u0026#34;), exchange = @Exchange(name = \u0026#34;hello.direct\u0026#34;), key = {\u0026#34;red\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;aqua\u0026#34;} )) public void listenDirectQueue2(String msg){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;2 received message: \u0026#34; + msg); } } Sender\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 public class SpringamqpTest { @Test public void testDirectExchange(){ // Exchange String exchangeName = \u0026#34;hello.direct\u0026#34;; // Message String msg = \u0026#34;hello, aqua\u0026#34;; rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend(exchangeName,\u0026#34;aqua\u0026#34;,msg); } } In the example above, only Consumer 2 receives the message. If the routing key was \u0026ldquo;red\u0026rdquo;, both would receive it.\nTopic TopicExchange is similar to DirectExchange, but its routingKey must be a list of multiple words, separated by ..\nWhen queues and exchanges specify a BindingKey, wildcards can be used:\n#: Matches one or more words. *: Matches only one word.

emp.setUsername(\u0026#34;Tom2\u0026#34;); emp.setName(\u0026#34;Tom2\u0026#34;); emp.setGender((short) 1); emp.setImage(\u0026#34;tom.jpg\u0026#34;); emp.setJob((short) 1); emp.setEntrydate(LocalDate.of(2000,1,1)); emp.setDeptId(1); emp.setUpdateTime(LocalDateTime.now()); emp.setId(19); empMapper.update(emp); } } Select (Query) There are two main types: querying all attributes by ID, and querying based on specific conditions.\nQuery by ID Interface:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 @Mapper public interface EmpMapper { // Query by ID @Select(\u0026#34;select * from mybatis.emp where id = #{id}\u0026#34;) public Emp idSelect(Integer id); } Testing:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 @SpringBootTest class Mybatis02ApplicationTests { @Autowired private EmpMapper empMapper; @Test public void testIdSelect(){ Emp emp = empMapper.idSelect(19); System.out.println(emp); } } Result:\n1 Emp(id=19, username=Tom2, password=123456, name=Tom2, gender=1, image=tom.jpg, job=1, entrydate=2000-01-01, deptId=null, createTime=null, updateTime=null) Some results are null because the field names in the Emp class don\u0026rsquo;t match the database column names.\nThere are three ways to fix this:\nUsing Aliases 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 @Mapper public interface EmpMapper { // Method 1: Aliases @Select(\u0026#34;select id, username, password, name, gender, image, job, entrydate, dept_id deptId, create_time createTime, update_time updateTime\u0026#34; + \u0026#34; from mybatis.emp where id = #{id}\u0026#34;) public Emp idSelect(Integer id); } Using the @Results Annotation 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 @Mapper public interface EmpMapper { // Method 2: @Results and @Result annotations @Results({ @Result(column = \u0026#34;dept_id\u0026#34;, property = \u0026#34;deptId\u0026#34;), @Result(column = \u0026#34;create_time\u0026#34;, property = \u0026#34;createTime\u0026#34;), @Result(column = \u0026#34;update_time\u0026#34;, property = \u0026#34;updateTime\u0026#34;) }) @Select(\u0026#34;select * from mybatis.emp where id = #{id}\u0026#34;) public Emp idSelect(Integer id); } Using Automatic Mapping (CamelCase) If your database uses underscores (a_column) and your Java properties use camelCase (aColumn), you can enable automatic mapping.\nAdd this to application.properties:\n1 mybatis.configuration.map-underscore-to-camel-case=true Then you can use the original simple code:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 @Mapper public interface EmpMapper { // Query by ID @Select(\u0026#34;select * from mybatis.emp where id = #{id}\u0026#34;) public Emp idSelect(Integer id); } Tip: You can install the MyBatisX plugin in IDEA for easier development.\nQuery by Conditions Requirement: Search for employees based on name (fuzzy match), gender (exact match), and entry date range.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 @Mapper public interface EmpMapper { // Conditional query // Note: ${name} is used here within single quotes, which allows concatenation inside quotes. @Select(\u0026#34;select * from mybatis.emp where name like \u0026#39;%${name}%\u0026#39; and gender = #{gender} and \u0026#34; + \u0026#34;entrydate between #{begin} and #{end} order by update_time desc\u0026#34;) public List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; conditionSelect(String name, short gender, LocalDate begin, LocalDate end); } Using interpolation ${} for string concatenation is insecure (SQL injection risk).\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 @Mapper public interface EmpMapper { // More secure conditional query @Select(\u0026#34;select * from mybatis.emp where name like concat(\u0026#39;%\u0026#39;,#{name},\u0026#39;%\u0026#39;) and gender = #{gender} and \u0026#34; + \u0026#34;entrydate between #{begin} and #{end} order by update_time desc\u0026#34;) public List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; conditionSelect(String name, short gender, LocalDate begin, LocalDate end); } This uses the concat function. Testing:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 @SpringBootTest class Mybatis02ApplicationTests { @Autowired private EmpMapper empMapper; @Test public void testConditionSelect(){ List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; empList = empMapper.conditionSelect(\u0026#34;Zhang\u0026#34;, (short) 1, LocalDate.of(2010, 1, 1), LocalDate.of(2020, 1, 1)); System.out.println(empList); } } Parameter Name Note In SpringBoot 2.x+, variable names inside #{} are automatically mapped to method parameters. In 1.x or standalone MyBatis, you must use the @Param annotation.\n1 2 3 4 5 @Mapper public interface EmpMapper { // In 1.x or standalone MyBatis, add @Param annotations: public List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; conditionSelect(@Param(\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;) String name, @Param(\u0026#34;gender\u0026#34;) short gender, @Param(\u0026#34;begin\u0026#34;) LocalDate begin, @Param(\u0026#34;end\u0026#34;) LocalDate end); } Using XML Mapper Files Annotations are convenient for short SQL, but XML files are better for long or complex queries to keep the code clean. Guidelines:\nThe XML filename must match the Mapper interface name and be placed in the same package structure (within resources). The XML namespace must match the fully qualified name of the Mapper interface. The SQL id in XML must match the method name in the interface, and return types must match. XML In a Maven project, non-Java files go in src/main/resources. Create a directory structure matching the Mapper\u0026rsquo;s package.\nIf the interface is net.yexca.mapper.EmpMapper.java, the XML should be at src/main/resources/net/yexca/mapper/EmpMapper.xml.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 \u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34; ?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE mapper PUBLIC \u0026#34;-//mybatis.org//DTD Mapper 3.0//EN\u0026#34; \u0026#34;https://mybatis.org/dtd/mybatis-3-mapper.dtd\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Header found on the official MyBatis site --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;mapper namespace=\u0026#34;net.yexca.mapper.EmpMapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- id matches the method name --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- resultType is the type for a single record --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;select id=\u0026#34;conditionSelect\u0026#34; resultType=\u0026#34;net.yexca.pojo.Emp\u0026#34;\u0026gt; select * from mybatis.emp where name like concat(\u0026#39;%\u0026#39;,#{name},\u0026#39;%\u0026#39;) and gender = #{gender} and entrydate between #{begin} and #{end} order by update_time desc \u0026lt;/select\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/mapper\u0026gt; Interface Class 1 2 3 4 @Mapper public interface EmpMapper { public List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; conditionSelect(String name, short gender, LocalDate begin, LocalDate end); } Dynamic SQL Dynamic SQL changes based on user input or external conditions.\nFor example, in the conditional query above, if a user only provides one parameter instead of all three, the query might return nothing.

It’s a 2024 summary, but also a record of my thoughts and journey over the past few years. My writing isn\u0026rsquo;t the most polished, and I have a lot I want to say but don\u0026rsquo;t quite know how to synthesize it all. So, here it is.\nMy Journey from 2020 to 2024 Since 2020, I\u0026rsquo;ve felt time accelerating. Even though I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced a lot, I haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to recapture that pre-2020 feeling—the sense that I was living each day intentionally or that time was a vast resource. However, looking at it objectively, I\u0026rsquo;ve done a lot every year. This year, in particular, was packed.\n2020 Took my college entrance exams this year, then kicked off my first experience living away from home. Joined some clubs at uni and got involved in a ton of activities. 2021 Spent the first half of the year busy with club stuff. In the second half, I switched over to the Apple ecosystem, changed my major, and set up this blog. 2022 Paid a premium to get the Switch OLED right when it dropped and had a blast playing it. Bought a Quest 2 the same year to start my VR journey and wrote some VRChat tutorials. Also took a trip to Nanjing at the end of the year. 2023 Moved to a new campus this year. Started going to some ACG events, like the Genshin Impact collabs with Pizza Hut and Hey Tea. After campus restrictions were lifted later on, I explored the surrounding areas a bit. Took the Soft Exam (software qualification) and JLPT, bought a Google Pixel 6, and got hooked on collecting credit cards. 2024 Probably my most exciting year yet. Started the year interning in Shenzhen—checked out the new Costco there, saw the ocean for the first time, met so many awesome people, explored Huaqiangbei, and visited Hong Kong and Macau (plus my first boat ride!). My mindset really shifted too; after graduating and moving home, my attitude toward others changed, and I started connecting more with my family. We went to Xuzhou together. I also started cooking, DIY-ing stuff, and got my driver's license. After all that, I went to Japan—my first time flying, first time wearing anime gear in public, and my first time attending Comiket (C105)! The volume of events seems to increase every year, yet my subjective feeling remains: \u0026ldquo;Time is flying, and I haven\u0026rsquo;t really done anything.\u0026rdquo; This paradox confuses me.\nTheoretical Explanations for Life Note: These theories are purely personal conjecture, unverified and unanalyzed. Proceed with skepticism.\nIn the second half of 2023, while I was supposed to be prepping for post-grad exams, I suffered from severe eye pain. I could barely keep my eyes open for more than four hours a day. During that time, drifting in and out of sleep, I developed a theory to explain life. I became obsessed with \u0026ldquo;explaining\u0026rdquo; existence.\nState Behavior Theory I even named these ideas. The first was \u0026ldquo;State Behavior Theory.\u0026rdquo; I treated all factors influencing human behavior as quantifiable variables (emotions, information access, past experiences, environmental factors). Each variable has a weight. If you could capture enough variables, you could predict a person\u0026rsquo;s behavior with high accuracy. Extrapolating this: if you knew every variable for every person, life would be deterministic.\nThe theory didn\u0026rsquo;t start this way. It began as a few days of daydreaming until I realized it mapped almost perfectly to \u0026ldquo;State Behaviors\u0026rdquo; in Unity. That\u0026rsquo;s where the name came from. After analyzing more situations, it evolved into its current form.\nCircle Theory To help identify specific variables, I came up with \u0026ldquo;Circle Theory\u0026rdquo; to describe social influence. This grew from my observations of the internet. As I shifted from deep diving into single topics to a broader exploration of many, I noticed a strange phenomenon: internet populations are divided into \u0026ldquo;circles\u0026rdquo; based on interests. Each circle has its own self-consistent logic. Things that are shocking to the outside world are mundane inside the circle, and vice versa. There are also opposing circles—one claims X is good and everything else is bad, while the other claims the exact opposite. Circles aren\u0026rsquo;t isolated; they can be grouped into sets, where the behavior of the set represents the behavior of its subsets.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s similar to the concept of \u0026ldquo;information cocoons\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;echo chambers,\u0026rdquo; where people see what they want to see. Because the world is so populated, you can always find people who agree with you, reinforcing your views until you have a perfectly self-contained explanation for everything.\nOf course, these are just base conclusions. To explain a complex world, you need derivations and auxiliary theories.\nExplaining Famous Quotes For example, why do famous quotes often feel so profound? Based on State Behavior Theory (or a generalized theory of everything), we can assume things in the world share a \u0026ldquo;root parent class.\u0026rdquo; This root evolves into subclasses, which then evolve into abstract classes. When someone experiences something that is essentially an implementation of an abstract class, they summarize it into a quote. When we have a different experience that implements the same abstract class, the quote feels deeply resonant.\nMore rigorously: human history is so well-recorded that almost every possible choice has been made before (maybe not the exact event, but the abstraction of it). Therefore, you can find support or cautionary tales for literally anything. I don\u0026rsquo;t believe in absolute rights or wrongs; things are just relatively right or wrong within specific states or contexts.\nTrust Interpretation Theory Another one I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about lately is Trust Interpretation Theory. I believe the world runs on trust. When I cross the street, I trust the driver won\u0026rsquo;t suddenly hit me. When I walk past a stranger, I trust they won\u0026rsquo;t pull out a knife. These are common, habitual actions built on a foundation of generalized trust.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve considered many other theories over the last 18 months, but I\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten most of them.\nThe Gap Between Theory and Practice Occasionally, I wonder: if I could just do what I want as freely as a child, would I feel more free? But then I realize that child was buried long ago under the soil of rules.\nEven though I could \u0026ldquo;explain\u0026rdquo; my life problems, it didn\u0026rsquo;t help me live through them. In fact, it started having negative effects.\nAs my explanations grew, I slowly realized I was too immersed in the \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; and forgot that life is the \u0026ldquo;result.\u0026rdquo; I was constantly thinking about which choice would produce which output. While planning for every possibility makes for a smoother experience, it also makes life feel like a game where you\u0026rsquo;re skipping NPC dialogue. You\u0026rsquo;re just waiting for people to say the lines you\u0026rsquo;ve already anticipated so you can pick the response you\u0026rsquo;ve already analyzed. Life becomes boring.\nI tried to distract myself with entertainment: walking, shopping, running, traveling, gaming. But despite having the freedom to choose, I felt chained. Even leisure felt like a task—a way to achieve \u0026ldquo;numerical balance\u0026rdquo; in my psyche rather than actual joy. My life became a simulation game. When stressed, I followed the \u0026ldquo;rule\u0026rdquo; of \u0026ldquo;schedule entertainment to lower stress.\u0026rdquo; I quantified my life: this event caused X stress, so I need Y activity to reduce it. These activities weren\u0026rsquo;t things I truly enjoyed; they were just \u0026ldquo;stress relief\u0026rdquo; protocols that are generally considered effective. I felt like a child who is \u0026ldquo;scheduled\u0026rdquo; to play—they are going through the motions, but their heart isn\u0026rsquo;t in it.\nI am the designer and the executor of my own life. I’m following a script I wrote myself just to finish the task, but I\u0026rsquo;ve lost the emotional connection.\nI felt like I was living under a set of invisible chains. I had to follow specific rules; anything else was \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;wrong.\u0026rdquo; Or perhaps I was seeking validation—if I do X, I\u0026rsquo;ll be accepted; if I do Y, I won\u0026rsquo;t.\nIs this just another \u0026ldquo;Circle Theory\u0026rdquo; trap? Is my explanation of the world just part of another explanation? It\u0026rsquo;s like I see the world as points on an axis, and I\u0026rsquo;ve drawn the axis to explain them, but I myself am still trapped within the 2D coordinate system.\nSince Bilibili\u0026rsquo;s embedding is poor, I\u0026rsquo;ve linked the YouTube version. Kano has an official account. Bilibili ID: BV1zr4y1n7sM\nI suspected I was depressed. I even planned how I might end it. Writing this, I\u0026rsquo;m reminded of a lyric from Boku ga Shinou to Omotta no wa (I Thought About Ending It All): \u0026ldquo;The reason I think about death so much is because I\u0026rsquo;m probably too serious about living.\u0026rdquo; Exactly. Was I taking life too seriously?\nOther parts of that song resonate too. \u0026ldquo;Today is just like yesterday.\u0026rdquo; Even if the events are different, my logic for processing them remains the same. The theory doesn\u0026rsquo;t change, so life doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like it changes.\n\u0026ldquo;Fighting an invisible enemy.\u0026rdquo; Who am I fighting? It seems I\u0026rsquo;m fighting the negative side of the rules I created—my own uncertainty and my stubbornness regarding sadness.\n\u0026ldquo;If you want to change tomorrow, you have to change today. I know. I know. But\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; But what can I change? Based on my theoretical framework, even if I talk to others and they give me advice that moves me, I still fall back into the same patterns of sadness.\n\u0026ldquo;I thought about ending it all because I was told I was a cold person.\u0026rdquo; But I was just responding in a way I thought would be interesting to others.\n\u0026ldquo;Crying because I want to be loved is because I\u0026rsquo;ve learned the warmth of people.\u0026rdquo; Their concern is based on respect or social etiquette, not true care for me. I respond with polite, mechanical replies, void of emotion.\n\u0026ldquo;I thought about ending it all because I hadn\u0026rsquo;t met you yet\u0026hellip; because someone like you was born, I like the world a little more. Because someone like you exists, I have a little hope for the world.\u0026rdquo; But even when I seek help or get advice, I process it through my theory. It feels like a deterministic output. I call an API, input data, and get a result. If I do this, I get that. It’s too certain.\nBut life is inherently uncertain. I began to fear that uncertainty. To combat that fear, I tried to \u0026ldquo;patch\u0026rdquo; my theories, adding more sub-theories to explain away the unknown. It worked temporarily, but humans aren\u0026rsquo;t perfectly rational. Our first instinct is emotional. My theory acknowledged this—rationality told me the emotion was temporary and that time would eventually heal the wound.\nShifting from Explanation to Action Time flows like a river. I was standing on the bank calculating the volume of water, but I forgot to feel its temperature.\nI built a rational framework but became its prisoner. Even with total freedom, I felt restricted. The biggest flaw in my theory was that it over-emphasized logic and ignored experience and emotion. I was acting like an algorithm, following rules, only to realize I needed to actually express how I felt. It’s a slow transition. Changing a theory is instant, but changing a mindset or behavior is hard. It\u0026rsquo;s difficult to stop looking at everything through the lens of its \u0026ldquo;root cause.\u0026rdquo;\nI first realized my reliance on theory was becoming toxic. Even that realization could be explained by the theory itself (it explains everything, including its own failure). But people can change. Variables accumulate, weights shift, and eventually, they force a pivot.\nMeeting more people helped. Isolation protects you from social pain, but it limits your scope. I actually have my theory to thank for my first steps. While my introverted side thought talking to people was \u0026ldquo;inefficient,\u0026rdquo; the logical side told me it wasn\u0026rsquo;t illegal or against any rules, so it was a valid choice. Starting with one person with a great personality, I slowly began to change.\nBroadening my social circle allowed for deeper thinking, which refined the theory. This refined theory gave me more options (and more fears, since high risk equals high reward), but it also forced me to pay more attention to how things felt. This focus on feeling pulled me back from pure quantification.\nQuantification wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough anyway. Last month, I heard a dialogue while practicing my listening skills:\nA: Which of these two is better? B: A is pretty good. A: Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t B be better? (Explains why) B: If you already have a conclusion, why are you asking me?\nThis simple dialogue stuck with me. Often, I know what I want to do, but I don\u0026rsquo;t act. I just keep checking possibilities, trying to find every branch to maintain \u0026ldquo;certainty.\u0026rdquo; I wasn\u0026rsquo;t even looking for the \u0026ldquo;optimal\u0026rdquo; solution. That dialogue sparked something in me—the idea that the point of making a choice is to get the result you actually want.\nOr perhaps I just didn\u0026rsquo;t have a real goal. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t setting goals based on my own emotions or needs; I was setting goals based on \u0026ldquo;possibilities.\u0026rdquo; I didn\u0026rsquo;t actually like the goals I was creating.\nI started increasing the weight of the \u0026ldquo;feelings\u0026rdquo; variable. I need to prioritize the things I like. Theories are tools for understanding the world; they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the master. I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be governed by them. I should use them to reach the goals I want and the life I love!\nCurrent State I can express myself freely. I can act freely (within the law). Writing this post is proof that I\u0026rsquo;m breaking the chains. I used to think this was embarrassing—I didn\u0026rsquo;t even want to record my theories, which is why I forgot some of them.\nI realize that living is a process. That’s an unchangeable fact. As I once told a friend, \u0026ldquo;If you can\u0026rsquo;t change it, you have to adapt.\u0026rdquo; Life is full of people—the wonderful and the unfortunate. When we are sad, it’s usually because the unfortunate things have piled up and blinded us to the good things we still have.\nAs it says on my About Page , \u0026ldquo;Show up in style no matter when; put your whole heart into every experience.\u0026rdquo; To the world, I\u0026rsquo;m just an individual, a number. But to myself, I am the whole world!\n\u0026ldquo; Everything is a cloud, as long as you have a good mood ,\u0026rdquo; activate your Atopes , do what you love, buy what you like, and go where you want to go. Don\u0026rsquo;t overthink it. Express yourself.\nI’m thinking of RimoChan \u0026rsquo;s avatar right now. Truly love your life. You can spend a day in happiness or a day in pain—there\u0026rsquo;s no need for internal friction.\nConclusion What will next year bring? I\u0026rsquo;ll end with the tagline from my blog:\nLet\u0026rsquo;s program this imperfect world into the way I want it to be!\n","date":"2024-12-31T17:40:09+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/210/","title":"2024 Year in Review"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Introduction As I consume more information, I often find the need to write articles in other languages (especially since modern projects are almost always multilingual). Ever since I added i18n support to my graduation project, I\u0026rsquo;ve wanted it for everything I design or build. Even my recent practice project includes multilingual support (though that one is a bit dated; I\u0026rsquo;m working on a more modern version now).\nLooking back at my blog—the project I\u0026rsquo;ve maintained the longest—it still lacked internationalization. While I mostly write in Simplified Chinese, my previous blog was a messy mix of Chinese and English in the UI. It worked for me, but it was likely confusing for others.\nI tried setting up multilingual support in Jekyll but never quite got it right, so I switched to Hugo, which supports it natively. Every theme has its quirks, and this theme\u0026rsquo;s approach to categories and tags differs significantly from my previous one, so I\u0026rsquo;ll need time to adapt. This post is a bit rough because the configuration seems heavily theme-dependent, and the official documentation is already quite comprehensive.\nEnvironment I\u0026rsquo;m using Hugo via Docker, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to mess with local environment issues. You can see my setup here .\nCreating the Blog Create a new blog:\n1 hugo new site blogName Enter the directory:\n1 cd blogName Initialize the repository:\n1 git init Install a theme. I\u0026rsquo;m using hugo-theme-stack , but the process is similar for others:\n1 git submodule add https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack/ themes/hugo-theme-stack Configure hugo.toml to use the theme:\n1 theme = \u0026#39;hugo-theme-stack\u0026#39; Preview:\n1 hugo server Preview including drafts:\n1 hugo server -D Some changes (like configuration or page structure) might require clearing the cache:\n1 hugo --cleanDestinationDir Build the site (output defaults to the public directory):\n1 hugo Multilingual Support In your site configuration file (I use YAML), set the default language:\n1 2 defaultContentLanguage: \u0026#39;zh-cn\u0026#39; # Default language code defaultContentLanguageInSubdir: false # Whether to include the language code in the default language\u0026#39;s path Then define the specific language settings:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 languages: zh-cn: contentDir: \u0026#39;content/zh-cn\u0026#39; # Content directory for this language disabled: false languageCode: \u0026#39;zh-cn\u0026#39; languageDirection: \u0026#39;ltr\u0026#39; # Left-to-right (ltr) or right-to-left (rtl) languageName: \u0026#39;简体中文\u0026#39; title: \u0026#34;yexca\u0026#39;Blog\u0026#34; weight: 1 zh-tw: contentDir: \u0026#39;content/zh-tw\u0026#39; disabled: false languageCode: \u0026#39;zh-tw\u0026#39; languageDirection: \u0026#39;ltr\u0026#39; languageName: \u0026#39;繁體中文\u0026#39; title: \u0026#34;yexca\u0026#39;Blog\u0026#34; weight: 2 Font Internationalization: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/240 Writing Articles Unlike Jekyll, Hugo\u0026rsquo;s article structure is slightly more complex. Adding i18n makes it even more so, though this allows for high customization. This may vary by theme. In my case, the language configuration points to specific directories under content.\nYou can specify which directories contain your main content in the stack theme configuration:\n1 2 3 params: mainSections: - posts This means my Simplified Chinese posts should be in content/zh-cn/posts. Other directories are theme-specific; check your theme\u0026rsquo;s example site for details.\nTo create a new Simplified Chinese post:\n1 TZ=\u0026#34;Asia/Tokyo\u0026#34; hugo new content/zh-cn/posts/test.md If you don\u0026rsquo;t specify a timezone, it defaults to UTC. Coming from Jekyll, I find manually writing the timestamp a bit tedious.\nDefault post templates are located in blogName/archetypes and can be converted to YAML format.\nReferences Hugo - Quick start https://stack.jimmycai.com/guide/ Hugo - Multilingual mode ","date":"2024-12-27T23:11:45+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/209/","title":"Blog Internationalization with Hugo"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash A simple, no-framework Go backend.\nBackend development is typically interface-driven, or, as some say, CRUD engineering.

Reference-type channels are for communication between multiple goroutines, handling synchronization internally to ensure concurrent safety.\nKinda like RabbitMQ (just my personal analogy for easier learning, they\u0026rsquo;re actually different things).\nDeclaring Variables Channels are reference types. When copied or passed to a function, they refer to the same channel object. The zero value is nil.\nCreate them using the make() function, for example:\n1 2 3 c := make(chan int) // Add capacity of 3 c := make(chan int, 3) If the capacity is 0, the channel is unbuffered, blocking reads and writes. If greater than 0, it\u0026rsquo;s buffered and non-blocking until full, then it blocks.\nUse \u0026lt;- to send and receive data:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 // Send data to channel channel \u0026lt;- 3 // Receive and discard \u0026lt;-channel // Note no space // Receive and assign to a variable x := \u0026lt;-channel // Receive, assign to a variable, and check if successful (if channel is empty) data, flag := \u0026lt;-channel Unbuffered 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 package main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func main() { c := make(chan int) go func() { defer fmt.Println(\u0026#34;A.defer\u0026#34;) c \u0026lt;- 6 fmt.Println(\u0026#34;A running\u0026#34;) }() num := \u0026lt;-c fmt.Println(\u0026#34;num =\u0026#34;, num) fmt.Println(\u0026#34;main finished\u0026#34;) } Buffered 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;time\u0026#34; ) func main() { c := make(chan int, 3) go func() { defer fmt.Println(\u0026#34;A finished\u0026#34;) for i := 0; i \u0026lt; 3; i++ { c \u0026lt;- i fmt.Println(\u0026#34;A goroutine, i =\u0026#34;, i, \u0026#34;len =\u0026#34;, len(c), \u0026#34;cap =\u0026#34;, cap(c)) } }() time.Sleep(2 * time.Second) for i := 0; i \u0026lt; 3; i++ { num := \u0026lt;-c fmt.Println(\u0026#34;main, num =\u0026#34;, num) } fmt.Println(\u0026#34;main finished\u0026#34;) } Closing Channels Close them using close():\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 package main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func main() { c := make(chan int, 5) go func() { for i := 0; i \u0026lt; 5; i++ { c \u0026lt;- i } // Close close(c) }() for { if data, ok := \u0026lt;-c; ok { fmt.Println(data) } else { break } } fmt.Println(\u0026#34;Main Finished\u0026#34;) } Using range The above main\u0026rsquo;s for loop can be simplified using range:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 package main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func main() { c := make(chan int, 5) go func() { for i := 0; i \u0026lt; 5; i++ { c \u0026lt;- i } close(c) }() //for { // if data, ok := \u0026lt;-c; ok { // fmt.Println(data) // } else { // break // } //} for data := range c { fmt.Println(data) } fmt.Println(\u0026#34;Main Finished\u0026#34;) } Unidirectional Channels By default, channels are bidirectional (read and write). You can also specify a channel\u0026rsquo;s direction, making it read-only or write-only.\n1 2 3 4 5 var c chan int // Declare a normal bidirectional channel // c1 is write-only var c1 chan\u0026lt;- int // c2 is read-only var c2 \u0026lt;-chan int You can convert a bidirectional channel to a unidirectional one, but not the other way around. This means you can define function parameters as unidirectional but pass a bidirectional channel.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 // chan\u0026lt;- // Write-only func counter(out chan\u0026lt;- int) { defer close(out) for i := 0; i \u0026lt; 5; i++ { out \u0026lt;- i // Will block if the receiver doesn\u0026#39;t read } } // \u0026lt;-chan // Read-only func printer(in \u0026lt;-chan int) { for num := range in { fmt.Println(num) } } func main() { c := make(chan int) // Bidirectional go counter(c) // Producer printer(c) // Consumer fmt.Println(\u0026#34;done\u0026#34;) } select select can listen for data flow on multiple channels. Its syntax is similar to switch, but each case statement must be an I/O operation.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s typically placed inside a for{} block.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 package main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func main() { c := make(chan int) quit := make(chan int) go func() { for i := 0; i \u0026lt; 10; i++ { fmt.Println(\u0026lt;-c) } quit \u0026lt;- 0 }() // main x, y := 1, 1 for { select { case c \u0026lt;- x: tmp := x x = y y = tmp + y case \u0026lt;-quit: fmt.Println(\u0026#34;quit\u0026#34;) return // A default case is possible, but not needed here. } } } ","date":"2024-12-21T14:52:55+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/207/","title":"GoLang Channels"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Golang Series\nHello GoLang: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/154 GoLang (var and const): https://blog.yexca.net/archives/155 GoLang (func): https://blog.yexca.net/archives/156 GoLang (slice and map): https://blog.yexca.net/archives/160 GoLang (OOP): https://blog.yexca.net/archives/162 GoLang (reflect): https://blog.yexca.net/archives/204 GoLang (struct tag): https://blog.yexca.net/archives/205 GoLang (goroutine): This Article\nGoLang (channel): https://blog.yexca.net/archives/207 Process -\u0026gt; Thread -\u0026gt; Coroutine\nA coroutine is a \u0026ldquo;lightweight thread.\u0026rdquo; You can easily spawn tens of thousands of them without exhausting system resources. Multiple coroutines share the resources allocated to their parent thread.\nGo has native support for coroutines, which are called goroutines. Concurrency in Go is achieved through goroutines and channels.\nCreating a Goroutine Use the go keyword to start a goroutine.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;time\u0026#34; ) func newTask() { i := 0 for { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;newTask goroutine i =\u0026#34;, i) i++ time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) } } func main() { go newTask() i := 0 for { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;main goroutine i =\u0026#34;, i) i++ time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) } } Using Anonymous Functions You can also use anonymous functions with goroutines.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;time\u0026#34; ) func main() { go func() { defer fmt.Println(\u0026#34;A.defer\u0026#34;) func() { defer fmt.Println(\u0026#34;B.defer\u0026#34;) fmt.Println(\u0026#34;B\u0026#34;) }() // executes this anonymous function fmt.Println(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;) }() time.Sleep(2 * time.Second) } Anonymous functions can take parameters and return values. However, to get a return value from a goroutine, you need to use a channel. The example below shows only parameters:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;time\u0026#34; ) func main() { go func(a, b int) { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;a =\u0026#34;, a, \u0026#34;b =\u0026#34;, b) }(10, 20) time.Sleep(2 * time.Second) } Exiting When the main goroutine exits, all other worker goroutines are automatically terminated.\nYou can also use runtime.Goexit() to immediately stop the current goroutine (any defer statements will still execute).\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;runtime\u0026#34; \u0026#34;time\u0026#34; ) func main() { go func() { defer fmt.Println(\u0026#34;A.defer\u0026#34;) func() { defer fmt.Println(\u0026#34;B.defer\u0026#34;) runtime.Goexit() // exit the goroutine fmt.Println(\u0026#34;B\u0026#34;) }() // executes this anonymous function fmt.Println(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;) }() time.Sleep(2 * time.Second) } /* * Output: * B.defer * A.defer */ ","date":"2024-12-17T21:16:31+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/206/","title":"GoLang Goroutines"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Golang Series\nHello GoLang: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/154 GoLang (var and const) Variables and Constants: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/155 GoLang (func) Functions: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/156 GoLang (slice and map) Slices and Maps: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/160 GoLang (OOP) Object-Oriented Programming: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/162 GoLang (reflect) Reflection: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/204 GoLang (struct tag) Struct Tags: This Article\nGoLang (goroutine) Goroutines: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/206 GoLang (channel) Channels: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/207 Struct tags allow you to describe how a field behaves when used by specific packages.\nGetting Tag Values Define tags using backticks ` (the same key used for Markdown code blocks).\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;reflect\u0026#34; ) type User struct { // Separate multiple tags with spaces name string `doc:\u0026#34;name\u0026#34; info:\u0026#34;nameOfUser\u0026#34;` age int `info:\u0026#34;ageOfUser\u0026#34;` } func main() { user := User{\u0026#34;zhangSan\u0026#34;, 18} findTag(\u0026amp;user) } func findTag(input interface{}) { t := reflect.TypeOf(input).Elem() for i := 0; i \u0026lt; t.NumField(); i++ { tagInfo := t.Field(i).Tag.Get(\u0026#34;info\u0026#34;) tagDoc := t.Field(i).Tag.Get(\u0026#34;doc\u0026#34;) fmt.Println(\u0026#34;info:\u0026#34;, tagInfo, \u0026#34;doc:\u0026#34;, tagDoc) } } JSON Conversion 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 package main import ( \u0026#34;encoding/json\u0026#34; \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; ) type User struct { // Fields must be exported (capitalized) to be converted to JSON Name string `json:\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;` Age int `json:\u0026#34;age\u0026#34;` } func main() { user := User{\u0026#34;zhangSan\u0026#34;, 18} // struct -\u0026gt; json jsonStr, err := json.Marshal(user) if err != nil { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;error\u0026#34;, err) } else { fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;jsonStr : %s\\n\u0026#34;, jsonStr) } // json -\u0026gt; struct var user2 User err = json.Unmarshal(jsonStr, \u0026amp;user2) if err != nil { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;error\u0026#34;, err) } else { fmt.Println(user2) } } ","date":"2024-12-11T18:31:18+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/205/","title":"GoLang Struct Tags"},{"content":" Golang Series\nHello GoLang: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/154 GoLang (var and const) Variables and Constants: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/155 GoLang (func) Functions: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/156 GoLang (slice and map) Slices and Maps: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/160 GoLang (OOP) Object-Oriented Programming: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/162 GoLang (reflect) Reflection: This Article\nGoLang (struct tag) Struct Tags: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/205 GoLang (goroutine) Goroutines: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/206 GoLang (channel) Channels: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/207 notify: 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Reflection refers to a class of applications that are capable of self-description and self-control.\npair A Go variable consists of a type and a value part, which together form a pair.\nThe static type is the type the programmer sees while coding, while the concrete type is what the runtime system sees.\nWhether a type assertion succeeds depends on the variable\u0026rsquo;s concrete type, not its static type. Therefore, if a read variable\u0026rsquo;s concrete type also implements a write method, it can be type-asserted as write.\nReflection is built upon types. Since static types are fixed, reflection mainly interacts with the interface type (which holds the concrete type).\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 package main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34;

My efficiency is pretty low, honestly. Overall, I\u0026rsquo;d say the difficulty is a bit lower than China\u0026rsquo;s 408 exam, but the style and focus are different, so it\u0026rsquo;s hard to make a direct comparison. Hopefully, I can pick up the pace next time!\nRamblings Haven\u0026rsquo;t written much in this \u0026lsquo;ramblings\u0026rsquo; section lately. Honestly, it\u0026rsquo;s because when I think about publishing an article, I\u0026rsquo;m usually already exhausted and just don\u0026rsquo;t have the energy. This makes me think about how I used to just consider \u0026lsquo;should I learn this?\u0026rsquo; Now, I have to factor in time, energy, and everything else. Saw a meme recently that nails it:\nCan\u0026rsquo;t you just handle civil service exams with one hand, selected civil service with another, national exams with another, provincial exams with another, teaching qualifications with another, overseas study with another, internships with another, interviews with another, probation to full employment with another, fall recruitment with another, capstone projects with another, and dating with another? Oh, and you still need to keep one hand free, because Chinese people believe in always having a backup plan.\nThat really hit home. Human energy is limited. Gaining something always means losing something else—time, energy, passion, you name it. These are all quantifiable variables, but before, their upper limits were so high (or perhaps I was just overdrawing, to be precise) that I didn\u0026rsquo;t even notice them. As I get older, or rather, as I experience more things, more and more variables need to be considered, which probably explains why I\u0026rsquo;m always tired and less efficient.\nSometimes, living is just exhausting. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m too materialistic; a bit more idealism, and the world seems pretty good (I\u0026rsquo;m afraid to make definitive statements about anything now, I fear uncertainty, but life often lacks certainty, though this stems from not mastering all variables. Won\u0026rsquo;t elaborate further, or this section will become another novel).\nBackground Consider logic circuit X, configured as shown in Fig. 5.1, with input $ck$ and outputs $z_2, z_1, z_0$. Here, $R_0, R_1, R_2$ are positive-edge triggered D flip-flops, with their outputs initialized to 0. F is a logic circuit with inputs $x_2, x_1, x_0$ and outputs $y_2, y_1, y_0$, configured as shown in Fig. 5.2. A and B are any of the 2-input gates shown in Fig. 5.3. A clock pulse with a period of 1 unit time is applied to the $ck$ input of circuit X. Hereafter, let $n$ be a positive integer and $t$ be the time. At time $t=0$, $R_0, R_1, R_2$ are initialized. The output $z_2, z_1, z_0$ is assumed to stabilize at time $t=n$ due to the rising edge of the $n$-th clock pulse after time 0. This behavior is illustrated in Fig. 5.4. For the rest of this problem, delays caused by circuit components (gates, flip-flops, and wiring) are considered negligibly small compared to the clock pulse period.\nFig. 5.1: Logic Circuit X Fig. 5.2: Logic Circuit F Fig. 5.3: 2-input Gates Fig. 5.4: Operation of Circuit X 1 Answer the following questions a~f.\na) The outputs $y_2, y_1, y_0$ of circuit F are determined solely by the values of inputs $x_2, x_1, x_0$.

Nonlinear circuit\nb) The output $z_2, z_1, z_0$ of circuit X at time $t=n$ is equal to the values of $y_2, y_1, y_0$ at time $t=$ [blank]. Express [blank] as a function of $n$.\nc) Complete the truth table representing the operation of circuit F, as shown in the table format of Fig. 5.5, so that circuit X operates as shown in Fig. 5.4.\nFig. 5.5: Operation of Circuit F d) Choose the most appropriate name for a circuit that performs the operation shown in Fig. 5.4 from the following options, and answer with the symbol ①~④.\n① Decoder ② Multiplexer ③ Counter ④ Shift Register\ne) To make circuit X operate as shown in Fig. 5.4, what gates should A and B in Fig. 5.2 be? Choose from Fig. 5.3 and answer with the symbols ①~⑥. The same gate may be used multiple times.\nf) Represent the logical AND of Boolean variables $x$ and $y$ as $xy$, the logical OR as $x+y$, and the NOT of $x$ as $\\bar{x}$. Express the output $y_2$ of circuit F.\n1-Solutions 1-a An asynchronous circuit refers to a circuit that does not use a clock signal, where each part operates independently. A combinational circuit is one whose output is determined solely by the current values of its inputs. A sequential circuit\u0026rsquo;s output depends not only on the current inputs but also on its internal state (e.g., flip-flop outputs). A nonlinear circuit refers to a circuit with input-output characteristics that are not linear. This problem clearly refers to a \u0026lsquo;Combinational circuit\u0026rsquo;.\n1-b Because a D flip-flop first receives an input and only transfers it to the output on the rising edge of the clock, due to synchronous state updates, D flip-flops introduce a one-cycle delay. So, [blank]: $n-1$.\n1-c x_2 x_1 x_0 y_2 y_1 y_0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1-d A Decoder is a combinational logic circuit that decodes a small number of input signals into a larger number of output signals. It activates the corresponding output line based on the input\u0026rsquo;s binary encoding. A Multiplexer is a combinational logic circuit that selects one signal from multiple input signals to output. It uses select lines to determine which input signal passes through to the output. A Counter is a sequential logic circuit used to count pulse signals. Its output value changes in a specific way based on the number of pulse signals. A Shift Register is a sequential logic circuit that stores data and can shift it in a specific direction. It consists of a series of flip-flops. This problem clearly refers to a \u0026lsquo;Shift Register\u0026rsquo;.\n1-e A: ② (OR) B: ① (AND)\nBy analyzing the truth table and its circuit, since there are multiple outputs, we can examine them one by one.

Using G, logic circuit Y is constructed as shown in Fig. 5.7, with $ck$ as input and $z_2,z_1,z_0$ as output. Furthermore, logic circuit $X'$ shown in Fig. 5.8 is constructed using Y. C and D in Fig. 5.8 are any of the 2-input gates shown in Fig. 5.3. Answer the following questions a~e.\nFig. 5.6: Logic Circuit G\nFig. 5.7: Logic Circuit Y\nFig. 5.8: Logic Circuit $X'$\nFig. 5.9: Operation of Circuit Y\na) Circuit G uses 5 gates to obtain output $y_0$. Describe one circuit that can obtain the same output as $y_0$ in G, using 2 or fewer gates listed in Fig. 5.3.\nb) A clock pulse with a period of 1 unit time is applied to the $ck$ input of circuit Y. Assume $R_0,R_1,R_2$ are initialized at time $t=0$, and the output $z_2,z_1,z_0$ stabilizes at time $t=n$ due to the rising edge of the $n$-th clock pulse after time 0. Complete the table in Fig. 5.9 showing the output $z_2,z_1,z_0$ of circuit Y at times $t=1,4,7,12$.\nc) Let $m$ be a non-negative integer. Under the conditions described in b), consider the output set $(z_2,z_1,z_0)$ of circuit Y at time $t=m$ as a vector and denote it as $z(m)$. What is the maximum Hamming distance between $z(m)$ and $z(m+1)$?\nd) Circuit $X'$ in Fig. 5.8 and circuit X in Fig. 5.1 exhibit equivalent behavior. In this case, choose the gates for C and D in Fig. 5.8 from Fig. 5.3 and answer with the symbols ①~⑥. The same gate may be used multiple times. \u0026lsquo;Equivalent behavior\u0026rsquo; here means the following: A clock pulse with a period of 1 unit time is applied from the same pulse generator P to the $ck$ input of both $X'$ and X, as shown in Fig. 5.10. When the outputs $w_2,w_1,w_0$ and $z_2,z_1,z_0$ respectively stabilize at time $t=n$ due to the rising edge of the D clock pulse within $X'$ and X at time $t=0$, then $w_2=z_2$, $w_1=z_1$, and $w_0=z_0$.\nFig. 5.10 e) Consider a logic circuit like the one in Fig. 5.11. Assume inputs x and y simultaneously change from 0 to 1 at time $t=t_0$. Although output z is expected to remain 0, a pulse like that shown in Fig. 5.12 can occur due to delay in the NOT gate. This phenomenon is called a glitch (or hazard) and can cause malfunction depending on the connected circuit. In circuit $X'$ of Fig. 5.8, state whether a glitch can occur at output $w_0$ if delays in gates C and D are not negligible. If it can occur, suggest countermeasures; if not, explain why, in under 100 characters.

Without knowledge of Laplace transforms, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to solve quickly. While you might manage the first two major sections and the first three parts of the third section if you work fast (which is actually quite a lot), the last two questions are impossible if you don\u0026rsquo;t understand the underlying principles. (In the final part, I wrote about how to solve it without knowing the specific scenario, but it\u0026rsquo;s hard to say if one could react like that under exam pressure.)\nThe copyright of the questions belongs to the Institute of Science Tokyo. They are cited here for reference only, with no commercial intent.\nBackground The Laplace transform $F(s)=\\mathcal{L}[f(t)]$ of a twice-differentiable real function $f(t)$ with a real variable $t(\\ge0)$ is defined as follows:\n$$ F(s)=\\mathcal{L}[f(t)]=\\int_0^\\infty f(t)e^{-st}dt \\tag{4.1} $$Here, $s$ is a complex variable with a positive real part. Answer the following questions. You may use the following Laplace transform identities:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}[e^{-\\alpha t}f(t)] = F(s+\\alpha) \\tag{4.2} $$$$ \\mathcal{L}[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}f(t)] = sF(s) - f(0) \\tag{4.3} $$$$ \\mathcal{L}[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2}{\\mathrm{d}t^2}f(t)] = s^2F(s)-sf(0)-f'(0) \\tag{4.4} $$where $\\alpha$ is a real constant and $f'(t)=\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}f(t)$.\nThis section defines the Laplace transform and provides three key properties.\n1 Show that the following equations (a–c) hold. Assume $\\alpha$ is a real constant and $\\beta$ is a non-zero real constant.\na) $\\mathcal{L}[\\cos(\\beta t)]=\\dfrac{s}{s^2+\\beta^2}$\nb) $\\mathcal{L}[e^{-\\alpha t}\\cos(\\beta t)] = \\dfrac{s+\\alpha}{(s+a)^2+\\beta^2}$\nc) $\\mathcal{L}[e^{-\\alpha t}\\sin(\\beta t)]=\\dfrac{\\beta}{(s+a)^2+\\beta^2}$\nSolution a Substitute into the definition:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}[\\cos(\\beta t)] = \\int_0^\\infty \\cos(\\beta t)e^{-st}\\mathrm{d}t $$Using the corollary of Euler\u0026rsquo;s formula:\n$$ e^{i\\theta}=\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta $$Which is:\n$$ \\cos\\theta=\\frac{e^{i\\theta}+e^{-i\\theta}}{2} $$ The proof is straightforward, just substitute back:\n$$ \u003e \\begin{align} \u003e \\cos\\theta \u003e \u0026= \\frac{e^{i\\theta}+e^{-i\\theta}}{2} \\\\ \u003e \u0026= \\frac{(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta)+(\\cos(-\\theta) + i\\sin(-\\theta))}{2} \\\\ \u003e \u0026= \\frac{(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta)+(\\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta)}{2} \\\\ \u003e \u0026= \\frac{2\\cos\\theta }{2} \\\\ \u003e \u0026= \\cos\\theta \u003e \\end{align} \u003e $$ Substitute into the original equation:\n$$ \\begin{align} \\mathcal{L}[\\cos(\\beta t)] \u0026=\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{e^{i\\beta t}+e^{-i\\beta t}}{2}e^{-st}\\mathrm{d}t \\\\ \u0026= \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\int_0^\\infty e^{i\\beta t} \\cdot e^{-st}\\mathrm{d}t+\\int_0^\\infty e^{-i\\beta t} \\cdot e^{-st}\\mathrm{d}t\\right) \\\\ \u0026= \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\int_0^\\infty e^{-(s - i\\beta)t}\\mathrm{d}t + \\int_0^\\infty e^{-(s + i\\beta)t}\\mathrm{d}t\\right) \\end{align} $$Integrating yields:\n$$ \\begin{align} \\mathcal{L}[\\cos(\\beta t)] \u0026= \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{s-i\\beta}+\\frac{1}{s+i\\beta}\\right) \\end{align} $$ Integration process:\n$$ \u003e \\begin{align} \u003e \\int_0^\\infty e^{-at}\\mathrm{d}t \u003e \u0026= \\frac{1}{-a}e^{-at}\\mid_0^\\infty \\\\ \u003e \u0026= 0-\\frac{1}{-a} \\\\ \u003e \u0026= \\frac{1}{a} \u003e \\end{align} \u003e $$ Simplify by finding a common denominator:\n$$ \\begin{align} \\mathcal{L}[\\cos(\\beta t)] \u0026= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{s+i\\beta+s-i\\beta}{(s-i\\beta)(s+i\\beta)} \\\\ \u0026= \\dfrac{s}{s^2+\\beta^2} \\end{align} $$Q.E.D.\nb From $(4.2)$:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}[e^{-\\alpha t}f(t)] = F(s+\\alpha) $$And from part (a):\n$$ \\mathcal{L}[\\cos(\\beta t)]=\\dfrac{s}{s^2+\\beta^2} $$Therefore:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}[e^{-\\alpha t}\\cos(\\beta t)] = \\dfrac{s+\\alpha}{(s+\\alpha)^2+\\beta^2} $$Q.E.D.\nc Since:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\sin(\\beta t) = \\beta \\cos(\\beta t) $$Taking the Laplace transform of both sides:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\sin(\\beta t)] = \\mathcal{L}[\\beta \\cos(\\beta t)] $$From $(4.3)$:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}f(t)] = sF(s) - f(0) $$So:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\sin(\\beta t)] = sF(s)-\\sin(0)=sF(s) $$Meaning:\n$$ sF(s) = \\mathcal{L}[\\beta \\cos(\\beta t)] = \\beta \\mathcal{L}[\\cos(\\beta t)] $$From part (a):\n$$ \\mathcal{L}[\\cos(\\beta t)]=\\dfrac{s}{s^2+\\beta^2} $$Substituting this in:\n$$ sF(s) = \\beta \\dfrac{s}{s^2+\\beta^2} $$Solving for $F(s)$:\n$$ F(s) = \\dfrac{\\beta}{s^2+\\beta^2} $$Thus:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}[\\sin(\\beta t)] = \\dfrac{\\beta}{s^2+\\beta^2} $$ While reviewing, I realized a simpler method I thought of initially works too.

It felt great to solve it.\nFrom $(4.2)$:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}[e^{-\\alpha t}f(t)] = F(s+\\alpha) $$Therefore:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}[e^{-\\alpha t}\\sin(\\beta t)]=\\dfrac{\\beta}{(s+\\alpha)^2+\\beta^2} $$2 For the following differential equation, answer parts a–d:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2}{\\mathrm{d}t^2}f(t) + \\eta \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}f(t) + 2f(t) = 2 \\tag{4.5} $$Where $\\eta$ is a real constant and $f(t)$ is a twice-differentiable real function of $t(\\ge 0)$.

Initially, it felt like a \u0026lsquo;give up\u0026rsquo; moment. But after a walkthrough, the difficulty isn\u0026rsquo;t actually that high. It just needs a solid understanding of existing algorithms. My \u0026rsquo;not too high\u0026rsquo; assessment might be skewed by my initial fears of having to design some crazy new algorithm. (To be clear, I still wouldn\u0026rsquo;t call it easy.)\nProblem copyright belongs to Tokyo University of Science. Quoted for convenience, non-profit use only.\n1 We implemented two C functions to sort an integer array a with n elements in ascending order, each using a different algorithm. For Programs 3.1 and 3.2, pick the best algorithm name for captions A and B from the choices below, then give the corresponding symbol.\nChoices\nA. Selection Sort\nB. Bubble Sort\nC. Quick Sort\nD. Insertion Sort\nProgram 3.1: A 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 void sort_a(int a[], int n) { int i, j, tmp; for(i=0; i\u0026lt;n-1; ++i){ for(j=n-1; i\u0026lt;j; --j){ if(a[j]\u0026lt;a[j-1]){ tmp=a[j]; a[j]=a[j-1]; a[j-1]=tmp; } } } } Program 3.2: B 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 void sort_b(int a[], int n) { int i, j, tmp; for(j=1; j\u0026lt;n; ++j){ tmp=a[j]; i=j-1; while(0\u0026lt;=i \u0026amp;\u0026amp; tmp\u0026lt;a[i]){ a[i+1]=a[i]; --i; } a[i+1]=tmp; } } Solution\nThis problem\u0026rsquo;s straightforward: identify the sorting algorithms from the code. Program A is Bubble Sort (B. バブルソート), and Program B is Insertion Sort (D. 挿入ソート).\n2 Answer these questions about Heap Sort. Assume n is a positive integer.\na) For a binary heap, what condition must any non-root node\u0026rsquo;s value meet? (Either max-heap or min-heap condition is fine.)\nb) If a binary heap holds n elements, what\u0026rsquo;s its height in terms of n? (Height is max path length from root to a leaf.)\nc) For Heap Sort with n elements, pick the best asymptotic evaluation for both its average and worst-case time complexity from these options.\nA. $O(1)$\nB. $O(\\log n)$\nC. $O(n)$\nD. $O(n\\log n)$\nE. $O(n^2)$\nThis one\u0026rsquo;s all about heap sort. Part one: what condition must non-root nodes satisfy in a binary heap (max-heap or min-heap, pick one). Part two: give the height of the heap\u0026rsquo;s binary tree. Part three: select the average and worst-case time complexities.\nSolution\na\nMax-heap condition: Any non-root node\u0026rsquo;s value must be less than or equal to its parent\u0026rsquo;s value. Min-heap condition: Any non-root node\u0026rsquo;s value must be greater than or equal to its parent\u0026rsquo;s value. b\n$$ \\left \\lfloor \\log_2n \\right \\rfloor $$c\nAverage and worst-case time complexity: D. $O(n\\log n)$\n3 Consider $A=\\{ A[0], A[1], \\cdots, A[n-1] \\}$, an array of $n$ distinct integers. For non-negative integers $i,j \u003c n$, if $i\\lt j$ and $A[i]\\gt A[j]$, we call $(i,j)$ an inversion of $A$. The total number of such inversions is $A$\u0026rsquo;s inversion count. For instance, in $\\{ 5,7,4,6 \\}$, inversions are $(0,2),(1,2),(1,3)$, so the inversion count is 3. Answer these questions.\na) What\u0026rsquo;s the inversion count for $\\{ 1,0,4,3,2, \\}$?\nb) Given the set $\\{ 1,2,\\cdots,n \\}$, what arrangement of its $n$ elements yields the maximum inversion count? Express this max count in terms of $n$.\nc) Take any array B (of $n$ elements) from the set $\\{ 1,2,\\cdots,n \\}$ and sort it ascending with Bubble Sort. We know \u0026lsquo;X in Bubble Sort equals array B\u0026rsquo;s inversion count\u0026rsquo;. What\u0026rsquo;s X, and why is this true? Keep it concise.\nThis problem kicks off with \u0026lsquo;inversions\u0026rsquo; (Professor Song Hao\u0026rsquo;s Linear Algebra course covers this: video ). Part one: find the inversion count. Part two: find the maximum inversion count. Part three: identify what in Bubble Sort equals the inversion count, then explain why.\nSolution\na Inversion count is 4: (1,0), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2).\nb The maximum inversion count occurs when the permutation is\n$$ \\{ n, n-1, n-2, \\cdots, 2, 1 \\} $$For n, there are n-1 inversions. For n-1, n-2 inversions. And so on. The total inversion count is their sum.\n$$ (n-1)+(n-2)+\\cdots+2+1+0=\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} $$ c X: Number of swaps\nReason: Each swap fixes exactly one inversion.\nBubble sort compares adjacent elements. If they\u0026rsquo;re out of order, it swaps them. Each swap eliminates one inversion.\n4 Program 3.3 shows a C implementation of Merge Sort to sort an integer array ascending. Answer these questions.\nProgram 3.3: Merge Sort 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 int mergesort(int a[], int begin, int end, int w[]){ int mid = (begin+end)/2; int i = begin, j = mid+1, k, c=0; printf(\u0026#34;(%d, %d)\\n\u0026#34;, begin, end); if(begin\u0026lt;end){ mergesort(a, begin, mid, w); mergesort(a, mid+1, end, w); for(k=begin; k\u0026lt;=end; ++k){ if(mid\u0026lt;1){ A }else if(end\u0026lt;j){ B }else{ /* ++c */ if(a[i]\u0026lt;a[j]){ C }else{ D } } } for(k=begin; k\u0026lt;=end; ++k){ E } } return 0; } a) Fill in blanks A, B, C, D, E with the correct code from the options to complete the program. a is the array to sort, w is the temp working array. mergesort is called like this:\n1 2 int a[5] = {3, 5, 1, 4, 2}, w[5]; mergesort(a, 0, 4, w); Choices $$ \\begin{matrix} ア. a[k]=w[i] \u0026 イ. a[k]=w[i++] \u0026 ウ. a[k]=w[++i] \\\\ エ. a[k]=w[j] \u0026 オ. a[k]=w[j++] \u0026 カ. a[k]=w[++j] \\\\ キ. a[k]=w[k] \u0026 ク. a[k]=w[k++] \u0026 ケ. a[k]=w[++k] \\\\ コ. w[k]=a[i] \u0026 サ. w[k]=a[i++] \u0026 シ. w[k]=a[++i] \\\\ ス. w[k]=a[j] \u0026 セ. w[k]=a[j++] \u0026 ソ. w[k]=a[++j] \\\\ タ. w[k]=a[k] \u0026 チ. w[k]=a[k++] \u0026 ツ. w[k]=a[++k] \\end{matrix} $$b) With the mergesort call from (a), (0,4) prints on stdout\u0026rsquo;s first line. What prints on lines 3, 5, and 7, respectively?\nc) We want to count total element comparisons (line 18 in Program 3.3) for mergesort to sort its range. We uncommented line 17 and changed it to ++c;, but that\u0026rsquo;s not enough. How do we modify Program 3.3 to store the comparison count in count using these two lines?\n1 2 int a[5] = {3, 5, 1, 4, 2}, w[5]; int count = mergesort(a, 0, 4, w); No global or static variables. Besides the line 17 change, you\u0026rsquo;re limited to 3 line replacements. A \u0026lsquo;replacement\u0026rsquo; means swapping a line\u0026rsquo;s code with new code (60 chars max, no spaces). Your answer should follow the \u0026lsquo;Example Answer Format\u0026rsquo; below: show the line number and the new code. Assume line 17 is already uncommented; detail other needed changes.\n\u0026ldquo;Example Answer Format\u0026rdquo; 6行目：printf(\u0026quot;hello\\n\u0026quot;);\n30行目：c= end - begin + 1;\nSolution\na\nA: w[k] = a[j++]; i.e., セ B: w[k] = a[i++]; i.e., サ C: w[k] = a[i++]; i.e., サ D: w[k] = a[j++]; i.e., セ E: a[k] = w[k]; i.e., キ b\nLine 3: (0,1)\nLine 5: (1,1)\nLine 7: (3,4)\nc\nLine 8: c += mergesort(a, begin, mid, w);\nLine 9: c += mergesort(a, mid + 1, end, w);\nLine 31: return c;\nThis problem looked scary at first, but after a closer read, the concepts aren\u0026rsquo;t too bad. If you get merge sort, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty solvable. BTW, I\u0026rsquo;d mostly forgotten my algorithms, usually picking them up via animations (super intuitive). So, I was glad to stumble upon a cool animated algorithm site while tackling this.\n","date":"2024-11-23T20:35:28+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/200/","title":"Tokyo University of Science, Graduate School of Information Science and Technology 2020, Problem 3"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash An old post I wrote, system creation date 2023.12.01.\nLooking back at these old posts, I\u0026rsquo;m a bit hesitant to publish them.

Clearly state the null hypothesis $H_0$ and the alternative hypothesis $H_1$ in your answer.\n$H_0$: The probability of the ball landing in pocket A is the same as the other pockets. That is:\n$$ P(A)=\\frac{1}{4} $$$H_1$: The probability of the ball landing in pocket A is higher than the other pockets. That is:\n$$ P(A)\\gt \\frac{1}{4} $$The probability of the ball landing in pocket A exactly 4 times is:\n$$ P(X=4)=\\binom{5}{4} (\\frac{1}{4})^4 \\times \\frac{3}{4}=\\frac{15}{1024} $$The probability of the ball landing in pocket A exactly 5 times is:\n$$ P(X=5)=\\binom{5}{5} (\\frac{1}{4})^5=\\frac{1}{1024} $$Thus:\n$$ P(X\\ge 4)=\\frac{15}{1024}+\\frac{1}{1024}=\\frac{1}{64} $$Since this probability ($1/64 \\approx 0.0156$) is smaller than the significance level (0.05), we reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, the hypothesis that \u0026ldquo;this roulette wheel is biased toward pocket A\u0026rdquo; is statistically significant.\n","date":"2024-11-21T15:42:18+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/198/","title":"Institute of Science Tokyo, Graduate School of Information Science and Engineering, 2020 Question 1"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash Introduction Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s the people who no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine\nRecently, I learned from the comments on Bitecho\u0026rsquo;s video about the documentary about Turing, The Imitation Game.

For example, block elements take up a full line, while inline elements can display multiple per line.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t want to use standard flow for layout, you can use floats or Flexbox.\nFloats Purpose: To arrange block elements horizontally. The property is float, with two values: left and right.\nElements with float will be taken out of the standard document flow.\nClearing Float Effects Because floated elements are removed from the standard flow, if a parent element has no explicit height, the floated children won\u0026rsquo;t expand it, potentially leading to layout issues.\nFour common ways to clear floats:\nExtra Element Method Add a block-level element at the end of the parent, and set its CSS property clear:both.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; .clearfix { clear: both; } \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;clearfix\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Single Pseudo-element Method Same principle as above.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; .clearfix::after { content: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; display: block; clear: both; } \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;clearfix\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Dual Pseudo-element Method This method solves both parent collapse issues and float effects simultaneously.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; .clearfix::before, /* Fixes parent collapse */ .clearfix::after { content: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; display: table; } .clearfix::after { /* Clears floats */ clear: both; } \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;clearfix\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Using overflow Add the CSS property overflow: hidden; to the parent element.\nFlexbox Flexbox, also known as flexible box layout, is a browser-recommended layout model. It\u0026rsquo;s great for structured layouts, offering powerful space distribution and alignment capabilities.\nPlus, the Flex model doesn\u0026rsquo;t suffer from elements leaving the standard flow like floats do, making web layouts simpler and more flexible.\nComponents Flexbox has four main components:\nFlex Container Flex Item Main Axis: Defaults to horizontal. Cross Axis: Defaults to vertical. Set display: flex; on the parent element to make it a flex container. Its children then become flex items, which can automatically shrink or grow.\nFlexbox Properties Description Property Main Axis Alignment justify-content Cross Axis Alignment align-items Specific Flex Item\nCross Axis Alignment align-self Change Main Axis Direction flex-direction Flex Grow/Shrink flex Flex Item Wrapping flex-wrap Line Alignment align-content Main Axis Alignment Property: justify-content\nValue Effect flex-start Default, flex items align from the start. flex-end Flex items align from the end. center Flex items are centered along the main axis. space-between Flex items are evenly distributed along the main axis, with space distributed between them. space-around Flex items are evenly distributed along the main axis, with space distributed around them. space-evenly Flex items are evenly distributed along the main axis, with equal space between items and the container edges. Cross Axis Alignment Properties\nalign-items: Controls the cross-axis alignment for all flex items within the current flex container (set on the flex container). align-self: Controls the cross-axis alignment for a single flex item (set on the flex item). Value Effect stretch Flex items are stretched to fill the container along the cross axis (default stretch if no specific cross-axis size is set on the item). center Flex items are centered along the cross axis. flex-start Flex items align from the start of the cross axis. flex-end Flex items align from the end of the cross axis. Changing Main Axis Direction The main axis defaults to horizontal, the cross axis to vertical.\nProperty: flex-direction\nValue Effect row Horizontal, left to right (default). column Vertical, top to bottom. row-reverse Horizontal, right to left. column-reverse Vertical, bottom to top. Flex Grow/Shrink Ratio Purpose: Controls the size of a flex item along the main axis. Property: flex, added to the child (flex item).\nValue: An integer, representing a proportion of the remaining space in the parent.\nFlex Item Wrapping Flex items can automatically shrink or grow. By default, all flex items stay on a single line. Property: flex-wrap, added to the parent (flex container).\nValues are wrap (wrap to new lines) and nowrap (no wrapping, default).\nLine Alignment Property: align-content\nValues are the same as justify-content (main axis alignment), and only apply to multi-line flex containers.\n","date":"2024-11-10T21:36:51+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/195/","title":"HTML Learning Three - Web Layout"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Introduction 2022 SA am2\n01-08: http://127.0.0.1:4000/archives/191 09-15: http://127.0.0.1:4000/archives/192 16-20: http://127.0.0.1:4000/archives/193 21-25: http://127.0.0.1:4000/archives/194 These five questions weren\u0026rsquo;t too bad. I was feeling confident until I caught a glimpse of the afternoon essay questions—my confidence vanished instantly. :cry:\nThoughts Thinking about the meaning of life is definitely something people only do when they have free time. Once you get busy, there\u0026rsquo;s no room for stray thoughts. Though if you\u0026rsquo;re too busy, you might start thinking about it again.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve realized two of my previous shortcomings. First, I always assumed I could \u0026ldquo;review anytime.\u0026rdquo; Second, I was misusing the concept of \u0026ldquo;lifelong learning.\u0026rdquo;\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with \u0026ldquo;lifelong learning.\u0026rdquo; The concept itself is correct, but my interpretation was flawed. I used to think that because knowledge is infinite, I could never fully master anything, which led to a \u0026ldquo;know-nothing\u0026rdquo; mindset. In reality, while knowledge is endless, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to be a master of an entire field to apply it effectively. Often, mastering a specific subset is enough to handle the job.\nFor example, after passing an exam, I would still feel like I knew nothing and wasn\u0026rsquo;t qualified for the work. But objectively, if you\u0026rsquo;ve mastered the necessary parts, you are capable of the task. This mindset probably stems from my education—hearing things like \u0026ldquo;the world is huge,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;what you\u0026rsquo;ve learned is never enough,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;true experts are on another level.\u0026rdquo; While this encourages learning, it made me over-focus on my deficiencies and lose confidence. I hear many students now saying \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t do anything,\u0026rdquo; and it might be a side effect of this mindset.\nThen there\u0026rsquo;s the \u0026ldquo;I can look it up anytime\u0026rdquo; dependency. When I was studying for the JLPT N2, I read an article about how people learned before writing systems. Without written records, you might only hear a lesson once in your life, so you must memorize it. The article noted that because the internet is so convenient, we stop memorizing things. We think searchable info is our own knowledge, but if the network goes down, we actually know nothing. True knowledge is what has been internalized into memory.\nIn my case, I skipped memorizing things like Linux commands or specific algorithms because I thought I could just look them up. This created an illusion of competence; when I actually needed to write them, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t. That’s effectively not knowing it. This cycle reinforced that \u0026ldquo;know-nothing\u0026rdquo; feeling.\nSummary: Realize that if it\u0026rsquo;s not memorized, you don\u0026rsquo;t know it. The knowledge required for a specific job or role has boundaries. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to chase absolute mastery of everything.\nWriting this out feels slightly off from what I meant, and I used ChatGPT to help since my writing skills aren\u0026rsquo;t great, but there it is.\n21 In a system with an instruction cache of capacity $a$ MB and access time $x$ ns, and main memory of capacity $b$ MB and access time $y$ ns, which expression represents the average access time for the main memory and instruction cache combined from the CPU\u0026rsquo;s perspective? Let $r$ be the probability that the required instruction code is not in the instruction cache (miss rate), and ignore cache management overhead.\n$$ \\begin{align} ア　\u0026\\frac{(1-r)\\cdot a}{a+b} \\cdot x +\\frac{r \\cdot b}{a+b} \\cdot y \\\\ イ　\u0026(1-r) \\cdot x + r \\cdot y \\\\ ウ　\u0026\\frac{r \\cdot a}{a+b} \\cdot x + \\frac{(1-r) \\cdot b}{a+b} \\cdot y \\\\ エ　\u0026r \\cdot x + (1-r) \\cdot y \\end{align} $$Translation/Analysis:\nCache hit time is $(1-r) \\times x$ Cache miss time (reading from main memory) is $r \\times y$ Therefore, the answer is イ.\n22 Which of the following describes the \u0026ldquo;Shared Everything\u0026rdquo; characteristic in database server clustering technology?\nア Clustering configuration improves availability; in the event of a failure, data within the failed range can be taken over by a standby server.\nイ Each server is responsible for specific managed data. If one server fails, the data managed by that server cannot be processed, reducing the overall system availability.\nウ Data is partitioned across multiple magnetic disks, and since there is a one-to-one correspondence between servers and disks, parallel processing can be performed using multiple servers.\nエ Loads are balanced to effectively utilize resources of all servers. Additionally, by sharing data, processing can continue even if one server fails.\nAnalysis: Shared Everything is a database cluster architecture where all servers share the same data storage. This allows any server\u0026rsquo;s resources to access and process any data in the database, enhancing redundancy and fault tolerance. If one server fails, others take over.\nOption ア describes a Primary/Standby (Active/Passive) architecture. Option イ describes a Shared Nothing architecture. Option ウ describes a Shared Disk architecture (roughly). Option エ describes the Shared Everything/Resource sharing mechanism. The answer is エ.\n23 Which of the following descriptions regarding the reliability of a system composed of several subsystems is appropriate?\nア Fault masking, which prevents the impact of a fault in one subsystem from spreading to others, does not change the system\u0026rsquo;s MTBF but leads to a reduction in MTTR.\nイ When a fault is detected in a subsystem, retrying may sometimes yield the correct result. Therefore, retrying leads to an improvement in the system\u0026rsquo;s MTBF and a reduction in MTTR.\nウ Fault detection performed while a subsystem is running is done without stopping the system, so it does not change the system\u0026rsquo;s MTTR but leads to an improvement in MTBF.\nエ Failover, which disconnects a failed subsystem and automatically switches to a standby subsystem, does not change the system\u0026rsquo;s MTBF but leads to a reduction in MTTR.\nAnalysis: For systems with multiple subsystems, reliability depends on MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) and MTTR (Mean Time To Repair/Recovery).\nFault Masking: Prevents faults from spreading. While it helps isolate issues, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t directly reduce the time to repair the underlying failed component as much as a failover does. Retry: This is a fault-tolerance mechanism for transient errors. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t improve the system\u0026rsquo;s MTBF (the failure still happened) and doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily shorten the repair time. Fault Detection: Detecting a fault doesn\u0026rsquo;t magically increase the time between failures (MTBF). Failover: Switches a failed system to a standby one. This significantly reduces the recovery time (MTTR) by bypassing the repair process, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t change how often the subsystems fail (MTBF). The answer is エ.\n24 Transactions $T_1 \\sim T_4$ are scheduled between times $t_{1}$ and $t_{10}$. A transaction wait-for graph was created just before $T_1$ issues a commit at time $t_{10}$. Which transaction corresponds to \u0026lsquo;a\u0026rsquo;? Here, select(X) represents referencing resource X with a shared lock, and update(X) represents updating resource X with an exclusive lock. These locks are released upon commit. In the wait-for graph, an arrow $T_i \\rightarrow T_j$ indicates that $T_i$ is waiting for $T_j$ to release a lock.\n(Transaction Schedule $t_1$)\nTime $T_1$ $T_2$ $T_3$ $T_4$ $t_1$ select(A) $t_2$ select(B) $t_3$ select(B) $t_4$ select(A) $t_5$ update(B) $t_6$ select(C) $t_7$ select(C) $t_8$ update(C) $t_9$ update(A) $t_{10}$ commit (Transaction Wait-for Graph)\nア $T_1$ イ $T_2$ ウ $T_3$ エ $T_4$\nAnalysis: Shared locks (S) allow multiple readers. Exclusive locks (X) block everything.\nAt $t_5$, $T_4$ wants update(B) (X-lock). Resource B is S-locked by $T_2$ and $T_3$. So $T_4$ waits for $T_2$ and $T_3$. ($T_4 \\rightarrow T_2$ and $T_4 \\rightarrow T_3$). At $t_8$, $T_2$ wants update(C) (X-lock). Resource C is S-locked by $T_1$ (and $T_2$ itself). So $T_2$ waits for $T_1$. ($T_2 \\rightarrow T_1$). At $t_9$, $T_3$ wants update(A) (X-lock). Resource A is S-locked by $T_1$ and $T_4$. So $T_3$ waits for $T_1$ and $T_4$. ($T_3 \\rightarrow T_1$ and $T_3 \\rightarrow T_4$). Looking at the graph:\nTransaction \u0026rsquo;d\u0026rsquo; is waited on by everyone but waits for no one. This is $T_1$ (it commits at $t_{10}$). Transaction \u0026lsquo;a\u0026rsquo; is waited on by one entity and waits for \u0026rsquo;d\u0026rsquo;. Based on $T_2 \\rightarrow T_1$, \u0026lsquo;a\u0026rsquo; is $T_2$. Transactions \u0026lsquo;b\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;c\u0026rsquo; are $T_3$ and $T_4$. The answer is イ.\n25 The diagram shows a connection configuration for integrating an internal extension network using existing telephones and a PBX into an IP network.

A mechanism used to prove the creator of character image data restricted to online games.\nB. An electronic signature performed by an individual to prove the creator of electronic document data that requires identity verification, preventing tampering.\nC. An electronic signature allowed only for public institutions like national or local governments handling important documents to prove the creator and prevent tampering.\nD. For electronic documents created by a corporation, it proves that the creator is indeed that corporation and that the data has not been tampered with since creation.\nAnalysis: e-Seals are typically used for organizations or corporations to authenticate electronic documents, ensuring the creator is the legal entity and the document hasn\u0026rsquo;t been altered. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\n17 マルチベクトル型 DDoS 攻撃に該当するものはどれか。\nア　攻撃対象のWebサーバ1台に対して、多数のPCから一斉にリクエストを送ってサーバのリソースを枯渇させる攻撃と、大量のDNS通信によってネットワークの帯域を消費する攻撃を同時に行う。\nイ　攻撃対象のWebサイトのログインパスワードを解読するために、ブルートフォースによるログイン試行を、多数のスマートフォン、IoT機器などから成るボットネットを踏み台にして一斉に行う。\nウ　攻撃対象のサーバに大量のレスポンスが同時に送り付けられるようにするために、多数のオープンリゾルバに対して、送信元IPアドレスを攻撃対象のサーバのIPアドレスに偽装した名前解決のリクエストを一斉に送信する。\nエ　攻撃対象の組織内の多数の端末をマルウェアに感染させ、当該マルウェアを遠隔操作することによってデータの改ざんやファイルの消去を一斉に行う。\nTranslation: Which of the following is a multi-vector DDoS attack?\nA. Simultaneously exhausting a single target Web server\u0026rsquo;s resources by sending massive requests from multiple PCs and consuming network bandwidth with high-volume DNS traffic.\nB. Carrying out simultaneous brute-force login attempts to crack a target website\u0026rsquo;s password using a botnet consisting of smartphones and IoT devices.\nC. Sending simultaneous name resolution requests to multiple open resolvers while spoofing the source IP to the target server\u0026rsquo;s IP, so the target is flooded with response data.\nD. Infecting many terminals within a target organization with malware and remotely controlling them to tamper with data or delete files simultaneously.\nAnalysis: A multi-vector DDoS attack uses multiple attack methods at once. Option A uses both resource exhaustion and bandwidth consumption, making it a multi-vector attack. Option C is a DNS Amplification attack, which is a single vector. Option B focuses on password cracking rather than resource/bandwidth exhaustion. Option D is an intrusion/malware attack, not a DDoS-style bandwidth/resource exhaustion attack. The answer is A.\n18 暗号方式に関する記述のうち、適切なものはどれか。\nア　AESは公開鍵暗号方式、RSAは共通鍵暗号方式の一種である。\nイ　共通鍵暗号方式では、暗号化及び複合に同一の鍵を使用する。\nウ　公開鍵暗号方式を通信内容の秘匿に使用する場合は、暗号化に使用する鍵を秘密にして、複合に使用する鍵を公開する。\nエ　デジタル署名に公開鍵暗号方式が使用されることはなく、共通鍵暗号方式が使用される。\nTranslation: Which description regarding encryption methods is correct?\nA. AES is a public-key encryption method, and RSA is a common-key (symmetric) encryption method.\nB. In common-key encryption, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.\nC. When using public-key encryption for confidentiality, the encryption key is kept secret, and the decryption key is made public.\nD. Public-key encryption is never used for digital signatures; common-key encryption is used instead.\nAnalysis: This is a basic cryptography question. The answer is B. AES is symmetric (common-key), and RSA is asymmetric (public-key). For confidentiality in public-key encryption, you encrypt with the recipient\u0026rsquo;s public key and they decrypt with their private key. Digital signatures rely heavily on public-key infrastructure.\n19 CRYPTREC の役割として、適切なものはどれか。\nア　外国為替及び外国貿易法で規制されている暗号装置の輸出許可申請を審査、承認する。\nイ　政府調達においてIT関連製品のセキュリティ機能の適切性を評価、認証する。\nウ　電子政府での利用を推奨する暗号技術の安全性を評価、監視する。\nエ　民間企業のサーバに対するセキュリティ攻撃を監視、検知する。\nTranslation: Which is the correct role of CRYPTREC?\nA. Reviewing and approving export license applications for encryption devices regulated under the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act.\nB. Evaluating and certifying the appropriateness of security functions in IT-related products for government procurement.\nC. Evaluating and monitoring the security of cryptographic techniques recommended for use in e-government.\nD. Monitoring and detecting security attacks against private sector servers.\nAnalysis: CRYPTREC (Cryptography Research and Evaluation Committees) is a Japanese government project focused on cryptographic technology. Its main duties include researching, evaluating, recommending, and monitoring cryptographic algorithms to ensure security and reliability, especially for government use. Its core functions are recommending crypto tech, monitoring security, and supporting policy. The answer is C.\n20 インターネットとの接続において、ファイアウォールのNAPT機能によるセキュリティ上の効果はどれか。\nア　DMZ上にある公開Webサイトの脆弱性を悪用する攻撃を防御できる。\nイ　インターネットから内部ネットワークへの侵入を検知し、検知後の通信を遮断できる。\nウ　インターネット上の特定のWebサービスを利用するHTTP通信を検知し、遮断できる。\nエ　内部ネットワークからインターネットにアクセスする利用者PCについて、インターネットからの不正アクセスを困難にすることができる。\nTranslation: What is the security benefit of the NAPT function of a firewall when connecting to the internet?\nA. Defending against attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in public websites located in the DMZ.\nB. Detecting intrusions from the internet to the internal network and blocking communication after detection.\nC. Detecting and blocking HTTP communication that uses specific web services on the internet.\nD. Making it difficult for unauthorized access from the internet to user PCs that are accessing the internet from the internal network.\nAnalysis: NAPT (Network Address Port Translation) dynamically maps internal IP addresses and ports to external ones. Its primary security benefit is hiding internal IP addresses by sharing a single public IP, preventing external devices from directly addressing internal devices. This makes unsolicited external access much harder. The answer is D.\n","date":"2024-11-06T22:05:18+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/193/","title":"2022 SA am2 - Questions 16-20"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Introduction 2022 SA am2\n01-08: http://127.0.0.1:4000/archives/191 09-15: http://127.0.0.1:4000/archives/192 16-20: http://127.0.0.1:4000/archives/193 21-25: http://127.0.0.1:4000/archives/194 Starting from the middle questions, the difficulty is ramping up. Most of these topics are new to me, so I\u0026rsquo;m taking back what I said about this being an easy pass. However, if I passed without learning anything, there wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be much point in taking the exam. Even if I fail, the knowledge gained still has value.\nRamblings Since I wrote quite a bit here, I\u0026rsquo;m renaming the introduction to \u0026ldquo;Ramblings\u0026rdquo; (it was originally at the start, but it fits better here).\nEvery post lately seems to turn into a deep reflection (it turns out my brain has its limits).\nThese reflections actually started last year when my eyes began hurting intensely. I spent a lot of time just lying in bed listening to music (even natural scenery hurt to look at, not just screens). During that time—somewhere between dreams and reality—I developed two theories I call \u0026ldquo;State-Behavior Theory\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Circle Theory.\u0026rdquo; Since then, whenever I\u0026rsquo;m deep in thought or dreaming, I keep refining these theories. I originally wanted to publish them, but I kept procrastinating. Now I feel a bit shy about it because I haven\u0026rsquo;t cross-referenced them with existing research. I used to think this blog should be technical only, but now I don\u0026rsquo;t really care—hardly anyone reads this anyway, so I\u0026rsquo;ll write what I want.\nWhile writing this, I looked for a Warma video about \u0026ldquo;Explosion Radio.\u0026rdquo; I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find the exact one, but in her ninth episode, she mentions the feeling of making a perfect plan but then immediately wanting to scrap it just because \u0026ldquo;Why should I have to follow a plan?\u0026rdquo; This hit home. I often feel lost without a plan, but once I have one, I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve lost my freedom. It’s a loop: plan, scrap it, plan again, fail again. I want things but am afraid to approach them; a single setback makes me want to quit. Hearing someone else articulate this state makes me feel like I can break it.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve typed more than expected. I\u0026rsquo;ll stop here before this gets longer than the actual technical content.\n9 In the software testing process, you want to use a bug management chart to judge the test progress and software quality. Which of the following thoughts is the most appropriate?\nA. Because more bugs were detected than expected in the first half of the testing phase, the schedule was delayed. After revising the schedule, it was determined that testing would finish five days late.\nB. If test items are consumed according to schedule and the cumulative number of bugs detected does not increase, the software quality can be judged as high.\nC. If the cumulative number of test items completed, the cumulative number of bugs detected, and the number of unresolved bugs all stop changing, it is necessary to check if you are facing bugs that are difficult to resolve.\nD. The completion time of the test can be predicted almost accurately from the trend of the cumulative number of bugs detected and the trend of the number of unconsumed test items.\nTranslation Analysis: In testing progress and quality management, bug management charts visualize trends.\nA is irrelevant to the chart itself. B is fundamentally incorrect (no new bugs could mean bad testing). C is the correct answer. If nothing is moving, the team might be stuck on a \u0026ldquo;blocker\u0026rdquo; bug. D suggests high accuracy which is rarely the case in reality. 10 Which is the description of FMEA, an analysis method aimed at failure prevention?\nA. Identify potential failure modes that could occur in individual system components and evaluate their impact.\nB. Classify and analyze failures by the process or location where they occurred to identify processes or locations that should be improved.\nC. For a failure that has occurred, collect data and events related to the cause of the failure, and repeat \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; to dig into the cause and pursue the root cause.\nD. For a failure that has occurred, list the causes that triggered it and represent their relationship in a tree structure.\nTranslation Analysis: FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) is a systematic method to identify potential failure modes and evaluate their impact before they happen.\nA is the definition of FMEA. B is general failure classification. C is RCA (Root Cause Analysis). D is FTA (Fault Tree Analysis). Answer: A\n11 According to JIS X 0160:2021 (Software Life Cycle Processes), which task should be performed in the activity \u0026ldquo;Confirm Disposal\u0026rdquo; within the disposal process?\nA. Reuse, recycle, recondition, overhaul, store, or destroy selected software system elements.\nB. Define the disposal strategy for the software system.\nC. Prepare to deactivate and remove the software system or elements.\nD. Confirm that harmful conditions to human health, safety, security, and the environment after disposal are identified and addressed.\nTranslation Analysis:\nA is the actual execution of disposal. B is the planning/strategy phase. C is preparation. D is the \u0026ldquo;confirmation\u0026rdquo; aspect of ensuring the disposal was handled correctly and safely. Answer: D\n12 According to JIS X 0160:2021 (Software Life Cycle Processes), what is it called to modify a life cycle process or define a new life cycle process to achieve the purpose and results of the life cycle model?\nA. Simulation B. Tailoring C. Governance D. Benchmarking\nTranslation Analysis:\nTailoring is the standard term for adapting a process to fit specific project needs. Answer: B\n13 When setting KPIs for IT investment evaluation using the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) method, which is an example of a KPI from the internal business process perspective?\nA. Set the attendance rate of training sessions for improving IT literacy to 100%. B. Increase the operating profit margin by 5% compared to the same period last year. C. Keep the number of customer complaints within 20 per month. D. Reduce the number of days from order acceptance to product shipment by 3 days.\nTranslation Analysis: Balanced Scorecard perspectives:\nFinancial: Profit, ROI (Option B). Customer: Satisfaction, complaints (Option C). Internal Business Process: Efficiency, cycle time, quality (Option D). Learning and Growth: Training, employee skills (Option A). Answer: D\n14 In embedded system development, a new LSI to be installed in a product is being developed. If the LSI design is done in-house and the LSI manufacturing is outsourced, which is the appropriate type of contractor?\nA. IP Provider B. Design House C. Foundry D. Fabless Manufacturer\nTranslation Analysis:\nIP Provider: Sells design building blocks. Design House: Helps with the design. Foundry: A factory that specifically manufactures chips for other companies. Fabless: A company that designs but doesn\u0026rsquo;t have its own factory. Since we need someone to manufacture our design, we look for a Foundry.\nAnswer: C\n15 What is a characteristic of a Lab Contract?\nA. A contract where the client designates specific personnel from the vendor and provides direct instructions; the vendor assigns personnel based on this.\nB. The client asks the vendor to secure personnel meeting specific skill and headcount requirements based on the contract, and in return, the client guarantees a certain minimum level of orders.\nC. The contract amount paid to the vendor during development is kept low on the condition that the vendor also receives a share of the sales or profits the client earns from the developed system in the future.\nD. If the vendor completes the work in fewer man-hours than the minimum specified in the contract, they are required to bill based on actual man-hours worked.\nTranslation Analysis: A Lab Contract (or ODC - Offshore Development Center style) involves a vendor providing a dedicated team of a certain size/skill for a period, regardless of the specific project tasks.\nB describes this \u0026ldquo;capacity-based\u0026rdquo; arrangement. C describes a revenue-sharing model. Answer: B\n","date":"2024-11-04T23:29:15+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/192/","title":"2022 SA am2 -09-15"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Introduction 2022 SA am2\n01-08: http://127.0.0.1:4000/archives/191 09-15: http://127.0.0.1:4000/archives/192 16-20: http://127.0.0.1:4000/archives/193 21-25: http://127.0.0.1:4000/archives/194 The difficulty of this specific exam seems manageable, but there are still things I\u0026rsquo;ve already studied. I should be able to pass the objective questions after some solid review. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to finish these quickly and move on to the afternoon questions, as those are the real key to passing.\nThinking back, my approach for the first Common Subject exam was flawed. It’s pointless to grind through questions when I don\u0026rsquo;t understand the concepts at all. It\u0026rsquo;s better to take it slow, one question at a time. Previously, I was rushing to finish the analysis articles, which made that entire practice run basically useless. Since I\u0026rsquo;m just starting, it\u0026rsquo;s fine to go slow and steady.\nRandom Thoughts Lately, I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking of learning as a form of \u0026ldquo;connection.\u0026rdquo; My inspiration came from language learning, which is essentially connecting objects to words. Learning abstract concepts is similar: it\u0026rsquo;s about forming connections where a specific input produces a specific output. You deepen these links through repetition. A more direct example is how knowledge points relate; deriving one point from another is like building a bridge between two pieces of data. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve seen or derived this link, and then strengthened it, you\u0026rsquo;ve mastered the concept—just like how you master an object by learning its name. (Of course, this is just a random thought without proof. Most opinions I hear are probably based on personal experience rather than rigorous evidence anyway.) We form views based on our experiences; it\u0026rsquo;s hard to imagine what we haven\u0026rsquo;t seen. The only exception might be dreams. Maybe dreams are actually us visiting other worlds? This isn\u0026rsquo;t rigorous either, but I recently read a novel where the protagonist enters a world at a random location and, if they complete specific conditions, can keep memories or gains from that world. My own dreams made me lean toward this theory. But on second thought, it\u0026rsquo;s more likely that when we sleep, the brain can focus entirely on imagination, reaching its peak and creating things we can\u0026rsquo;t fathom while awake. For instance, the discoverer of the DNA double helix structure allegedly got the inspiration from a dream.\n1 In the early stages of agile development, which method involves stakeholders gathering to confirm pre-set questions and issues to reach a common understanding of project objectives, scope, etc., and then sharing the results?\nA. Agile Modeling\nB. Inception Deck\nC. Planning Poker\nD. User Story Mapping\nTranslation of Japanese options: ア Agile Modeling イ Inception Deck ウ Planning Poker エ User Story Mapping\nThe Inception Deck is a vital tool used particularly at the start of a project to ensure the team reaches a consensus on the project\u0026rsquo;s purpose and scope. The team explores critical questions (goals, risks, success criteria, etc.) beforehand, which helps everyone align on the overall direction and boundaries. Therefore, the correct answer is B (イ).\n2 Among software patterns, which description applies to GoF (Gang of Four) design patterns?\nA. As Java patterns, they consist of Argument Objects, Object Mutability, etc.\nB. Patterns for object-oriented development, categorized into three types: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.\nC. Categorized into four types: Structural, Distributed Systems, Interactive Systems, and Adaptive Systems.\nD. Consists of \u0026ldquo;Layers\u0026rdquo; for dividing elements of different abstraction levels into hierarchies, and \u0026ldquo;Broker\u0026rdquo; for component partitioning.\nTranslation of Japanese options: ア Java patterns\u0026hellip; イ Patterns for OO development, categorized into Creational, Structural, and Behavioral\u0026hellip; ウ Four categories: Structural, Distributed, Interactive, Adaptive\u0026hellip; エ Consists of Layers, Broker\u0026hellip;\nGoF design patterns are classic patterns proposed by four software engineers specifically for object-oriented programming. They are divided into three major categories: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral, used to solve common OO design problems. Therefore, the correct answer is B (イ).\nI looked up some related info , and it seems this is where the design patterns I wrote about previously originated.\n3 Among the architecture patterns in Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture (POSA), which one provides a mechanism to dynamically change the structure and behavior of software by splitting it into two levels: a meta-level and a base-level?\nA. Broker\nB. Microkernel\nC. Model-View-Controller\nD. Reflection\nTranslation of Japanese options: ア Broker イ Microkernel ウ Model-View-Controller エ Reflection\nThe Broker pattern is for distributed systems, aiming to decouple components (clients and servers) by using a broker for communication.\nThe Microkernel pattern is common in OS design, keeping core functions (memory/process management) in the kernel while implementing other features as pluggable modules.\nModel-View-Controller (MVC) is an interactive system pattern that separates business logic (Model), UI (View), and input control (Controller). It decouples logic but doesn\u0026rsquo;t focus on dynamic structural changes.\nThe Reflection pattern splits software into a \u0026ldquo;meta-level\u0026rdquo; and a \u0026ldquo;base-level.\u0026rdquo; The meta-level holds metadata describing the system\u0026rsquo;s structure/behavior, while the base-level handles the business logic. This allows the software to modify its own structure and behavior dynamically. It\u0026rsquo;s often used in systems requiring high extensibility. Therefore, the correct answer is D (エ).\n4 When using a DBMS in an embedded system, an in-process database is sometimes used to prevent communication overhead, avoid communication load, and keep the required memory within resource limits. Which of the following is an appropriate description of an in-process database?\nA. It communicates via sockets with an application program acting as a client in a client-server format and uses SQL for processing.\nB. The database engine is provided as a library, linked with the application program, and runs in the same memory space.\nC. The entire database is placed in memory to speed up database processing.\nD. Each table is managed as a single file, and the application program operates it via file I/O APIs.\nTranslation of Japanese options: ア Socket communication, client-server\u0026hellip; イ Library format, linked to app, same memory space\u0026hellip; ウ Entire DB in memory\u0026hellip; エ One table per file, file I/O APIs\u0026hellip;\nAn in-process database (インプロセスデータベース) means the DB engine is linked as a library within the application, sharing the same memory space. This avoids the overhead of client-server communication, making it ideal for resource-constrained embedded systems.\nOption A describes a client-server DB; Option C describes an \u0026ldquo;In-memory database\u0026rdquo;; Option D describes a file-based management approach. Therefore, the correct answer is B (イ).\n5 Using the Strategy pattern, a report output system was designed according to the following class diagram. Which description is appropriate?\nA. The client can use the report output strategy subclasses without being aware of the specific format being used.\nB. It is easy to add algorithms for new formats.\nC. The report output strategy class handles the logic of which format to use for the output.\nD. The report output algorithm is written inside the context class.\nTranslation of Japanese options: ア Client doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to know the subclass\u0026hellip; イ Easy to add new format algorithms\u0026hellip; ウ Strategy class handles the dispatching\u0026hellip; エ Algorithm is in the Context class\u0026hellip;\nThe diagram shows the Strategy pattern implemented for multi-format report generation. The core principle is separating the implementation of an algorithm from its use, allowing you to switch or add algorithms without touching the client code. I\u0026rsquo;ve actually written about Strategy pattern before .\nThe design makes adding new algorithms very convenient—you just implement a new concrete strategy class. Therefore, the correct answer is B (イ).\n6 Among the following methods of passing data between modules, which one results in the lowest module coupling?\nA. Passing a single data item via global data.\nB. Passing a single data item via arguments.\nC. Passing a data structure via global data.\nD. Passing a data structure via arguments.\nTranslation of Japanese options: ア Single item via global\u0026hellip; イ Single item via arguments\u0026hellip; ウ Data structure via global\u0026hellip; エ Data structure via arguments\u0026hellip;\nThis is about software coupling. I\u0026rsquo;ve also written an article on this .\nPassing a single value is \u0026ldquo;Data Coupling,\u0026rdquo; passing a data structure is \u0026ldquo;Stamp Coupling,\u0026rdquo; and using global parameters is \u0026ldquo;Common Coupling.\u0026rdquo; Data coupling has the lowest degree of coupling. Therefore, the correct answer is B (イ).\n7 What is the appropriate sequence of steps for creating a DFD when modeling a new system based on an existing one?\nA. Current Physical -\u0026gt; Current Logical -\u0026gt; New Physical -\u0026gt; New Logical\nB. Current Physical -\u0026gt; Current Logical -\u0026gt; New Logical -\u0026gt; New Physical\nC. Current Logical -\u0026gt; Current Physical -\u0026gt; New Physical -\u0026gt; New Logical\nD. Current Logical -\u0026gt; Current Physical -\u0026gt; New Logical -\u0026gt; New Physical\nTranslation of Japanese options: ア Current Phys -\u0026gt; Current Logic -\u0026gt; New Phys -\u0026gt; New Logic イ Current Phys -\u0026gt; Current Logic -\u0026gt; New Logic -\u0026gt; New Phys ウ Current Logic -\u0026gt; Current Phys -\u0026gt; New Phys -\u0026gt; New Logic エ Current Logic -\u0026gt; Current Phys -\u0026gt; New Logic -\u0026gt; New Phys\nI\u0026rsquo;ll bet on B (イ). Generally, creating a DFD involves abstracting business requirements from the current implementation (Physical to Logical), then improving that logical model for the new requirements (Current Logical to New Logical), and finally implementing the new physical system (New Physical).\n8 In the development of a certain procurement system, which of the following is an appropriate example of exploratory testing performed by a developer?\nA. Based on past experience developing procurement systems, the developer guessed data patterns likely to detect flaws in input item correlation checks and created test cases in advance.\nB. To confirm if the product price applied according to the quantity range is correct, test cases using the median value of each range were created and tested.\nC. To confirm if organization names are printed correctly before and after an organizational change, test cases were created in advance using the effective start date and the day before as order dates.\nD. To confirm that no slip is created when the combination of input values is invalid, several representative combinations were tested, and based on those results, the next test cases were created and tested repeatedly.\nTranslation of Japanese options: ア Guessed patterns based on experience, pre-made test cases\u0026hellip; イ Used median values for range testing\u0026hellip; ウ Pre-made cases for date-based changes\u0026hellip; エ Tested combinations, created next cases based on results repeatedly\u0026hellip;\nExploratory testing is a style where test design and execution occur dynamically. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t rely on fixed, pre-defined test cases; instead, you adjust the test plan in real-time based on system observations. The key is that test cases are not fully pre-set but are refined based on prior results.\nIn options A, B, and C, the test cases are created in advance, which is traditional scripted testing. Option D involves a feedback loop based on results. Therefore, the correct answer is D (エ).\n","date":"2024-11-03T23:11:52+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/191/","title":"2022 SA am2 -01-08"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Introduction 2022 SA am1\n01-02: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/184 03-05: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/185 06-10: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/186 11-15: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/189 16-30: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/190 Going through this entire paper, a lot of it feels like the Software Designer exam. I guess some common subjects have lower requirements for software development, while specialized papers might be tougher. Many technical terms are hard to grasp at first, but once translated, the problems are manageable. Memorizing those terms is definitely key.\nQuestion 16 In the following flowchart, which is the minimum set of test cases required to satisfy branch coverage?\nA: (1) A=0, B=0 (2) A=1, B=1\nB: (1) A=1, B=0 (2) A=1, B=1\nC: (1) A=0, B=0 (2) A=1, B=1 (3) A=1, B=0\nD: (1) A=0, B=0 (2) A=0, B=1 (3) A=1, B=0\nThis question asks for the minimum number of test cases to hit every branch. No detailed analysis needed; the answer is Option B (イ).\nQuestion 17 No problems have occurred, but to resolve inconsistencies between the program specifications and the current source code, reverse engineering is used to rewrite the specifications. Which category of software maintenance does this fall into?\nA: Perfective Maintenance\nB: Corrective Maintenance\nC: Adaptive Maintenance\nD: Preventive Maintenance\nTranslation/Analysis:\nOld memories are coming back to haunt me—I learned this but forgot it all.\nPerfective Maintenance: Enhancing software functions, performance, or quality to meet new requirements. Corrective Maintenance: Fixing defects or errors in the software. Adaptive Maintenance: Adapting software to environmental changes (like a new OS or hardware). Preventive Maintenance: Performing maintenance to prevent potential problems before they happen. So, the answer is Option D (エ).\nQuestion 18 An organization uses Earned Value Management (EVM) to manage project schedule and cost. For a 10-day project, the status at the end of day 5 is shown in the table. If the cost efficiency remains the same, what is the Estimated at Completion (EAC) in ten thousand yen?\nManagement Item Amount (10k Yen) Budget at Completion (BAC) 100 Planned Value (PV) 50 Earned Value (EV) 40 Actual Cost (AC) 60 A: 110\nB: 120\nC: 135\nD: 150\nAnalysis:\nThis is new territory for me. The formula for Estimated at Completion (EAC) is:\n$$ EAC=\\frac{BAC}{CPI} $$Where CPI (Cost Performance Index) is:\n$$ CPI=\\frac{EV}{AC} $$Plugging in the numbers:\n$$ \\begin{align} CPI\u0026=\\frac{40}{60}=\\frac{2}{3} \\\\ EAC\u0026=\\frac{100}{\\frac{2}{3}}=150 \\end{align} $$The answer is Option D (エ).\nQuestion 19 In a software development project, what is the shortest duration (in days) required to complete all tasks in the table?\nTask Prerequisites Duration (Days) Requirements Def. None 30 Design Requirements Def. Done 20 Manufacturing Design Done 25 Testing Manufacturing Done 15 User Manual Creation Design Done 20 User Training Testing \u0026amp; User Manual Done 10 A: 80\nB: 95\nC: 100\nD: 120\nAnalysis:\nJust draw the network diagram. It\u0026rsquo;s a straightforward one. The answer is Option C (ウ).\nQuestion 20 In ITIL 2011 edition, an example of a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for Availability Management is shortening the \u0026ldquo;metric representing maintainability.\u0026rdquo; Which of the following corresponds to a maintainability metric?\nA: Number of interruptions within a certain period\nB: Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)\nC: Mean Time Between Service Incidents (MTBSI)\nD: Mean Time to Restore Service (MTTRS)\nAnalysis:\nIn ITIL Availability Management, maintainability usually refers to the ability to restore or repair a system after a failure, rather than the frequency of failures. Mean Time to Restore Service (MTTRS) describes recovery speed—how long it takes on average to get back up. The answer is Option D (エ).\nQuestion 21 In the construction and operation of core business systems, if a Data Administrator (DA) and a Database Administrator (DBA) are appointed separately, which of the following is an appropriate role for the DA?\nA: Tracking trends in business data volume growth and planning disk expansions.\nB: During the design phase, primarily performing logical database design and managing/standardizing data items.\nC: During the testing phase, primarily handling performance tuning.\nD: When a system failure occurs, performing data recovery and consistency checks.\nAnalysis:\nA Data Administrator (DA) focuses on logical data management, including data standards, definitions, and logical design. The DBA usually handles hardware resources, performance tuning, and recovery. The answer is Option B (イ).\nQuestion 22 Regarding the acquisition and evaluation of audit evidence, which description is inappropriate according to the System Audit Standards (2018)?\nA: In an Agile system development project, only documents formatted as formal management documents can be used as audit evidence.\nB: In an audit of an outsourced business site, if the auditor decides they can rely on a third-party assurance report from the contractor, the on-site survey can be omitted.\nC: Before the main investigation to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence, a preliminary investigation is conducted to understand the actual state of the audit target.\nD: For a single audit objective, multiple audit procedures are usually combined to perform the audit.\nAnalysis:\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t know this specific standard, but system audit standards don\u0026rsquo;t mandate that Agile project evidence must be \u0026ldquo;formally formatted management documents.\u0026rdquo; In practice, informal docs (meeting minutes, code repos, boards) are valid evidence of actual status. The answer is Option A (ア).\nQuestion 23 Which of the following is the explanation for BPO?\nA: Constructing a mechanism to ensure important business operations are not interrupted, or the interruption period is minimized, even after damage from disasters or accidents.\nB: Outsourcing some or all non-core business operations to specialized external companies.\nC: A production management method that determines the required quantity and timing of materials based on a master production schedule, Bill of Materials (BOM), and inventory info.\nD: Evaluating projects based on strategic alignment, cost-effectiveness, and risk to manage and optimize the balance of IT investment.\nAnalysis:\nBPO (Business Process Outsourcing) is about delegating non-core tasks to external pros to focus on core business. The answer is Option B (イ).\nOption A is Business Continuity Plan (BCP). Option C is Material Requirements Planning (MRP). Option D is Project Portfolio Management (PPM). Question 24 In IT investment evaluation methods, which metric calculates how many years it takes to recover the initial cash outflow based on cash flow?\nA: IRR (Internal Rate of Return)\nB: NPV (Net Present Value)\nC: PBP (Pay Back Period)\nD: ROI (Return On Investment)\nAnalysis:\nIRR: The discount rate where NPV equals zero; measures profitability. NPV: Sum of present values of future cash flows minus initial investment. PBP: Payback Period; the answer. ROI: Ratio of profit to investment cost. The answer is C (ウ).\nQuestion 25 Among UML diagrams, which one is used in business requirements definition to describe business flows and can represent branching, parallel processing, and synchronization?\nA: Activity Diagram\nB: Class Diagram\nC: State Machine Diagram\nD: Use Case Diagram\nAnalysis:\nActivity diagrams are perfect for business processes, showing branches, parallel paths, and synchronization. Class diagrams show static structure. State machine diagrams show object lifecycles. Use case diagrams define functional requirements and actor interactions. The answer is Option A (ア).\nQuestion 26 In PPM (Product Portfolio Management), which business is positioned as a source of investment funds?\nA: High market growth rate, high relative market share.\nB: High market growth rate, low relative market share.\nC: Low market growth rate, high relative market share.\nD: Low market growth rate, low relative market share.\nAnalysis:\nIn the BCG matrix (PPM), this is the \u0026ldquo;Cash Cow.\u0026rdquo; High market share brings stable cash flow, while low growth means minimal need for reinvestment, making it a source of funds for other ventures. The answer is Option C (ウ).\nQuestion 27 In the semiconductor industry, what is a characteristic business model of a foundry company compared to a fabless company?\nA: Outsourcing production to factories to reduce investment in production equipment.\nB: Focusing on the design and marketing of their own products to open new markets.\nC: Focusing on selling their own products to expand sales.\nD: Specialized in taking on production contracts from multiple companies to produce many products at low cost.\nAnalysis:\nFoundries focus on manufacturing. They don\u0026rsquo;t design their own chips; they provide production services for others. This allows for high-volume, low-cost production. The answer is Option D (エ).\nQuestion 28 Which type of information is the primary target of XBRL?\nA: Medical charts/records.\nB: Corporate customer information.\nC: Corporate financial information.\nD: Local government resident information.\nAnalysis:\nXBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) is a standard for business and financial reporting. The answer is Option C (ウ).\nQuestion 29 Which of the following is a characteristic of PM theory in leadership studies?\nA: Focuses on analyzing personal traits like personality, intelligence, and appearance of great leaders.\nB: Focuses on two dimensions of leadership style: Performance (goal achievement) and Maintenance (group maintenance).\nC: Leadership effectiveness depends on the situational factor of subordinate maturity (autonomy).\nD: Leadership effectiveness depends on the leader\u0026rsquo;s personality and situational factors like control and influence.\nAnalysis:\nPM theory (Performance-Maintenance) argues leadership style is built on those two dimensions. The answer is Option B (イ).\nQuestion 30 Company A commissioned Company B to create a sales management system program based on Company A\u0026rsquo;s requirements, without any specific agreement regarding copyright. In this case, which description of the original attribution of the program copyright is appropriate?\nA: Company A and B negotiate to decide attribution.\nB: It is jointly owned by Company A and B.\nC: It belongs to Company A.\nD: It belongs to Company B.\nAnalysis:\nWithout a specific agreement, under Japanese copyright law (similar to China), the copyright of a work created under contract usually belongs to the actual creator, which is Company B.

(If they didn\u0026rsquo;t hurt, I probably would have finished this entire exam paper by now).\nQuestion 11 OpenFlow を使った SDN(Software-Defined Networking) に関する記述として、適切なものはどれか。\nア　インターネットのドメイン名を管理する世界規模の分散データベースを用いて、IPアドレスの代わりに名前を指定して通信できるようにする仕組む\nイ　携帯電話網において、回線交換方式ではなく、パケット交換方式で音声通話を実現する方式\nウ　ストレージ装置とサーバを接続し、WWN(World Wide Name) によってノードやポートを識別するストレージ用ネットワーク\nエ　データ転送機能とネットワーク制御機能を論理的に分離し、ネットワーク制御を集中的に行う可能にしたアーキテクチャ\nTranslation: Which of the following descriptions regarding SDN (Software-Defined Networking) using OpenFlow is correct?\nA: Using a global distributed database to manage internet domain names so that communication can be performed using names instead of IP addresses.\nB: A method in mobile communication networks that realizes voice calls via packet switching instead of circuit switching.\nC: A storage network that connects storage devices and servers, identifying nodes and ports via WWN (World Wide Name).\nD: An architecture that logically separates the data forwarding function from the network control function, enabling centralized network control.\nAnalysis: Option A describes DNS. Option B describes VoIP (Voice over IP) in mobile networks. Option C describes SAN (Storage Area Network). Therefore, the correct answer is Option D.\nQuestion 12 メッセージの送受信における署名鍵の使用に関する記述のうち、適切なものはどれか。\nア　送信者が送信者の署名鍵を使ってメッセージに対する署名を作成し、メッセージに付加することによって、受信者が送信者による署名であることを確認できようになる。\nイ　送信者が送信者の署名鍵を使ってメッセージを暗号化することによって、受信者が受信者の署名鍵を使って、暗号文を元のメッセージに戻すことができるようになる。\nウ　送信者が送信者の署名鍵を使ってメッセージを暗号化することによって、メッセージの内容が関係者以外に分からないようになる。\nエ　送信者がメッセージに固定文字列を付加し、更に送信者の署名鍵を使って暗号化することによって、受信者がメッセージの改ざん部位を特定できるようになる。\nTranslation: Which of the following descriptions regarding the use of signature keys in message transmission is correct?\nA: The sender creates a signature for the message using their own signature key and attaches it to the message, allowing the receiver to verify that the signature was generated by the sender.\nB: The sender encrypts the message using their signature key so that the receiver can restore the original message using the receiver\u0026rsquo;s signature key.\nC: The sender encrypts the message using their signature key to ensure the message content remains unknown to anyone except the parties involved.\nD: The sender attaches a fixed string to the message and encrypts it with their signature key, allowing the receiver to identify the specific part of the message that was tampered with.\nAnalysis: Digital signatures usually refer to RSA algorithms here. Generally, you decrypt with a public key; the private key (signature key) is never leaked, so Option B is incorrect. Signature keys aren\u0026rsquo;t used for message confidentiality because the public key is public—anyone can decrypt it—so Option C is incorrect. Cryptographic keys cannot pinpoint which specific part of a message was tampered with; they only detect if tampering occurred. Thus, Option D is incorrect. The correct answer is Option A.\nQuestion 13 クライアント証明書で利用者を確認するリバースプロキシサーバを用いて、複数のWebサーバにシングルサインオンを行うシステムがある。このシステムに関する記述のうち、適切なものはどれか。\nア　クライアント証明書を利用者のPCに送信するのは、Webサーバではなく、リバースプロキシサーバである。\nイ　クライアント証明書を利用者のPCに送信するのは、リバースプロキシサーバではなく、Webサーバである。\nウ　利用者IDなどの情報をWebサーバに送信するのは、リバースプロキシサーバではなく、利用者のPCである。\nエ　利用者IDなどの情報をWebサーバに送信するのは、利用者のPCではなく、リバースプロキシサーバである。\nTranslation: There is a system that uses a reverse proxy server to verify users via client certificates and perform Single Sign-On (SSO) across multiple web servers. Which description of this system is correct?\nA: The reverse proxy server, not the web server, sends the client certificate to the user\u0026rsquo;s PC.\nB: The web server, not the reverse proxy server, sends the client certificate to the user\u0026rsquo;s PC.\nC: The user\u0026rsquo;s PC, not the reverse proxy server, sends information such as the user ID to the web server.\nD: The reverse proxy server, not the user\u0026rsquo;s PC, sends information such as the user ID to the web server.\nAnalysis: This setup is common in large enterprises. Client certificates are stored on the client side; the reverse proxy handles the certificate verification (Options A and B are logically flawed regarding \u0026ldquo;sending\u0026rdquo; certificates to the PC in this context). Once the reverse proxy completes verification, it forwards the user information to the backend web servers. Therefore, the answer is Option D.\nQuestion 14 内部ネットワークのPCからインターネット上のWebサイトを参照するときに、DMZに設置したVDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure) サーバ上のWebブラウザを利用すると、未知のマルウェアがPCにダウンロードされるのを防ぐというセキュリティ上の効果が期待できる。この効果を生み出すVDIサーバの動作の特徴はどれか。\nア　Webサイトからの受信データを受信処理した後、IPsecでカプセル化し、PCに送信する。\nイ　Webサイトからの受信データを受信処理した後、実行ファイルを削除し、その他のデータをPCに送信する。\nウ　Webサイトからの受信データを受信処理した後、生成したデスクトップ画面の画像データだけをPCに送信する。\nエ　Webサイトからの受信データを受信処理した後、不正なコード列が検知されない場合だけPCに送信する。\nTranslation: When a PC on an internal network accesses a website on the internet, using a web browser on a VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure) server located in the DMZ can prevent unknown malware from being downloaded to the PC. Which characteristic of the VDI server produces this security effect?\nA: After processing received data from the website, it encapsulates it with IPsec and sends it to the PC.\nB: After processing received data from the website, it deletes executable files and sends other data to the PC.\nC: After processing received data from the website, it sends only the generated desktop screen image data to the PC.\nD: After processing received data from the website, it sends it to the PC only if no malicious code strings are detected.\nAnalysis: The answer is Option C. By definition, a virtual desktop setup only transmits the visual screen data to the client, preventing the actual transfer of malicious binaries to the local host.\nQuestion 15 ファジングに該当するものはどれか。\nア　サーバにFINバケットを送信し、サーバからの応答を観測して、稼働しているサービスを見つけ出す。\nイ　サーバのOSやアプリケーションソフトウェアが生成したログやコマンド履歴などの解析して、ファイルサーバに保存されているファイルの改ざんを検知する。\nウ　ソフトウェアに、問題を引き起こしそうな多様なデータを入力し、挙動を監視して、脆弱性を見つけ出す。\nエ　ネットワーク上を流れるバケットを収集し、そのプロトコルヘッダやペイロードを解析して、あらかじめ登録された攻撃パターンと一致するものを検出する。\nTranslation: Which of the following corresponds to Fuzzing?\nA: Sending FIN packets to a server and observing the response to discover running services.\nB: Analyzing logs and command history generated by the server OS or application software to detect tampering with files stored on a file server.\nC: Inputting various data that might cause problems into software and monitoring its behavior to find vulnerabilities.\nD: Collecting packets flowing over the network and analyzing their protocol headers and payloads to detect matches with pre-registered attack patterns.\nAnalysis: Fuzzing is an automated software testing technique that provides invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a computer program to find security vulnerabilities. The goal is to see if the program crashes or behaves unexpectedly. Therefore, the answer is Option C.\nOption A describes a FIN scan (similar to nmap). Option B describes part of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Option D describes a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using signature-based detection.\n","date":"2024-10-26T21:41:16+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/189/","title":"2022 SA am1 -11-15"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Introduction Even if I write a Japanese title, this post isn\u0026rsquo;t primarily in Japanese.

Calculus covered arc-length parameterization, and Linear Algebra (or Probability here) covers the 37% rule. If you already know these conclusions, the problems are much easier. If you\u0026rsquo;ve never studied them and still solve them from scratch—kudos to you. If I had to start from zero, I\u0026rsquo;d definitely fail.\nAlso, since these are established theories, the final answers should be correct. As for the derivation process\u0026hellip; well, who knows? XD\nProblem Source: https://www.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/edu/entra/examarchive.shtml The copyright of the problem belongs to the University of Tokyo. It is cited here for convenience and non-profit educational purposes.\nSuppose you are interviewing $n$ candidates for a part-time job and want to hire the best one. Let $n \\ge 2$. There is an absolute ranking from 1 to $n$ among the candidates. For candidates already interviewed, their relative ranking is known. Interviews are conducted one by one in a random order that is not known in advance. The hiring decision is based on the relative ranking of candidates already interviewed, subject to the following conditions:\nA decision to hire or reject must be made immediately after each interview. The hiring process ends as soon as a candidate is hired. A rejected candidate cannot be hired later. If no candidate is hired by the $(n-1)$-th interview, the $n$-th candidate is hired automatically. The following strategy is used for hiring, where $1 \u003c r \\le n$:\nAutomatically reject the first $r-1$ candidates. For subsequent candidates, hire the first one who is better than the best candidate among the first $r-1$ (relative rank 1). Let $P_{n}(r)$ be the probability of hiring the candidate with absolute rank 1 using this strategy. Answer the following questions:\n(1) Calculate $P_{4}(2)$.\n(2) Show that $P_{10}(3)=\\frac{2}{10}(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{3}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{9})$.\n(3) For $n$ candidates, find the probability that the candidate with absolute rank 1 is hired at the $k$-th interview, where $r \\le k \\le n$.\n(4) In the following recurrence relation, find the expressions for $A$ and $B$:\n$$ P_{n}(r)=A+B\\times P_{n}(r+1) $$$A$ and $B$ should be expressions involving $n, r$, and constants.\n(5) Let $q=r/n$. Explain that $P_{n}(r)$ can be approximated by $-q\\ln(q)$ when $n$ is sufficiently large. Furthermore, find the value of $q\\in (0,1]$ that maximizes $-q\\ln(q)$. Note that $\\ln$ denotes the natural logarithm.\nSolution Background: This problem describes the \u0026ldquo;37% Rule\u0026rdquo; (The Secretary Problem). If you\u0026rsquo;ve seen math popularization videos on optimal stopping, this should look familiar.\nQuestion 1 Calculate $P_{4}(2)$.\n$$ \\begin{align} P_{4}(2) \u0026=\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\\\ \u0026=\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{12} \\\\ \u0026=\\frac{11}{24} \\end{align} $$The calculation sums the probability that the best candidate is selected if they appear in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position. To select the best candidate, no one appearing between the $r$-th person and the best candidate can be better than the best of the first $r-1$ people. Let\u0026rsquo;s break it down:\nIf the best candidate is in the 1st position, they are automatically rejected. Probability = 0.\nIf the best candidate is in the 2nd position ($k=2$), since we start hiring from the 2nd person, and no one can be better than the \u0026ldquo;best\u0026rdquo; (absolute rank 1), the selection probability is 1.\nIf the best candidate is in the 3rd position ($k=3$), there are two cases for the first two people:\nIf the 2nd person is better than the 1st, the 2nd person is hired. The best (3rd) is missed. If the 1st person is better than the 2nd, the 3rd person (the best) will be hired. The probability of hiring the best here is $1/2$.\nIf the best candidate is in the 4th position ($k=4$), the best candidate is hired only if the best among the first 3 people is located within the first $r-1$ (the first person). This happens with a probability of $1/3$.\nSumming these up: $P = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 0 + \\frac{1}{4} \\times 1 + \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{3}$.\nQuestion 2 Show that $P_{10}(3)=\\frac{2}{10}(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{3}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{9})$.\nAssume the best candidate is at position $m$ ($3 \\le m \\le 10$). To hire them, the best candidate among the first $m-1$ must be within the first 2 positions ($r-1=2$). The probability of this is $\\frac{2}{m-1}$. Thus, the probability of selecting the best candidate given they are at position $m$ is:\n$$ \\begin{align} P =\u0026\\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{2}{2}+\\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{2}{3}+\\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{2}{4}+\\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{2}{5}+\\\\ \u0026\\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{2}{6}+\\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{2}{7}+\\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{2}{8}+\\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{2}{9} \\\\ =\u0026\\frac{1}{10}(\\frac{2}{2}+\\frac{2}{3}+\\frac{2}{4}+\\frac{2}{5}+\\frac{2}{6}+\\frac{2}{7}+\\frac{2}{8}+\\frac{2}{9}) \\\\ =\u0026\\frac{2}{10}(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{5}+\\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{1}{7}+\\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{1}{9}) \\end{align} $$Since the best candidate cannot be hired if they are in the first two positions:\n$$ \\begin{align} P_{10}(3) \u0026=\\frac{1}{10} \\times 0 + \\frac{1}{10} \\times 0 + P \\\\ \u0026=P \\end{align} $$The proposition is proven.\nQuestion 3 Find the probability of hiring the best candidate at the $k$-th interview ($r \\le k \\le n$).\nFor the best candidate to be hired at the $k$-th interview, the best candidate must be at position $k$ (probability $1/n$). Additionally, the best person among the first $k-1$ candidates must be within the first $r-1$ candidates (so that no one is hired before $k$). The probability of this is $\\frac{r-1}{k-1}$. Therefore:\n$$ P = \\frac{1}{n} \\times \\frac{r-1}{k-1} $$Question 4 Find $A$ and $B$ for the recurrence $P_{n}(r)=A+B\\times P_{n}(r+1)$.\n$$ \\begin{align} P_{n}(r) \u0026= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=r}^{n} \\frac{r-1}{k-1} \\\\ \u0026= \\frac{1}{n}(\\frac{r-1}{r-1}+\\frac{r-1}{r}+\\frac{r-1}{r+1}+\\cdots+\\frac{r-1}{n-1}) \\\\ \u0026= \\frac{r-1}{n}\\sum_{i=r-1}^{n-1}\\frac{1}{i} \\end{align} $$Similarly:\n$$ P_{n}(r+1)=\\frac{r}{n}\\sum_{i=r}^{n-1}\\frac{1}{i} $$$$ \\frac{r}{n} \\times B = \\frac{r-1}{n} \\implies B = \\frac{r-1}{r} $$To find $A$: The sum for $P_{n}(r)$ has an extra term for $i=r-1$ compared to the sum in $P_{n}(r+1)$. The term is $\\frac{r-1}{n} \\times \\frac{1}{r-1} = \\frac{1}{n}$.\nThus, $A = \\frac{1}{n}$ and $B = \\frac{r-1}{r}$.\nQuestion 5 Explain the approximation $P_{n}(r) \\approx -q\\ln(q)$ for large $n$ and find the max.\nUsing the formula from above, when $n$ is large:\n$$ \\sum_{i=r-1}^{n-1}\\frac{1}{i} \\approx \\int_{r}^{n} \\frac{1}{x} dx = \\ln(n)-\\ln(r)= \\ln\\left(\\frac{n}{r}\\right) $$Thus:\n$$ P_{n}(r) \\approx \\frac{r}{n}\\ln\\left(\\frac{n}{r}\\right) = q\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{q}\\right) = -q\\ln(q) $$Let $y = -q\\ln(q)$. To find the maximum, take the derivative: $\\frac{\\mathrm{d} y}{\\mathrm{d} q} = -\\ln(q) - 1$. Setting $\\frac{\\mathrm{d} y}{\\mathrm{d} q} = 0$ gives $\\ln(q) = -1$, so $q = \\frac{1}{e}$.\nSo, the maximum value of $-q\\ln(q)$ occurs at $q = 1/e$ (approx 0.37).\nWrote with ChatGPT\n","date":"2024-10-25T19:24:36+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/188/","title":"University of Tokyo Graduate School of Engineering Mathematics 2020 Problem 3"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Introduction Even if the title is in Japanese, this post isn\u0026rsquo;t primarily in Japanese.

Hopefully, things will get better.\nRegarding this problem, it seems to belong to a specific course on vector calculus. I didn\u0026rsquo;t get it at first until I remembered 3b1b\u0026rsquo;s Essence of Linear Algebra and the general representation of vectors in math.\nIn fact, the problem defines almost everything you need. If these weren\u0026rsquo;t covered in your curriculum, you\u0026rsquo;d basically have to understand the definitions on the spot and solve it. Being able to solve this is impressive.\nAlso, since these are all proofs, I can\u0026rsquo;t guarantee the process is 100% correct.\nProblem Source: https://www.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/edu/entra/examarchive.shtml The copyright of the problem belongs to the University of Tokyo. It is quoted here for educational purposes only, non-commercially.\nConsider a smooth curve $\\boldsymbol{p}=(p(t),q(t))(t \\in [a,b])$ in the $xy$-plane. The length $l_{a^{'},b^{'}}$ of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ from time $t=a^{'} $ to $b^{'}$ is defined as:\n$$ l_{a^{'},b^{'}} = \\int_{a^{'}}^{b^{'}} \\sqrt{(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{\\mathrm{d} t})^2+(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} q}{\\mathrm{d} t})^2} \\mathrm{d} t $$The total length $l_{a,b}$ of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is denoted by $L$.

Specifically, it uses the distance from the starting point to a point on the curve as the new parameter, making the parametrization clean and reflective of geometric properties.\nQuestion 1 Since the curve time $t \\in [a,b]$, the total length $L$ is:\n$$ l_{a,b} = \\int_{a}^{b} \\sqrt{(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{\\mathrm{d} t})^2+(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} q}{\\mathrm{d} t})^2} \\mathrm{d} t $$And $s$ is the arc length from $a$ to $t$:\n$$ s = \\int_{a}^{t} \\sqrt{(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{\\mathrm{d} t})^2+(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} q}{\\mathrm{d} t})^2} \\mathrm{d} t $$Thus, $s$ represents the arc length from the starting point $a$ to the current point, so:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d} s}{\\mathrm{d} t} = \\sqrt{(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{\\mathrm{d} t})^2+(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} q}{\\mathrm{d} t})^2} $$Since $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is a curve with parameter $s$, and $s$ is a function of $t$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{\\mathrm{d} t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{\\mathrm{d} s} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} s}{\\mathrm{d} t} \\\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{d} q}{\\mathrm{d} t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d} q}{\\mathrm{d} s} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} s}{\\mathrm{d} t} $$Substituting these:\n$$ \\begin{align} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} s}{\\mathrm{d} t} \u0026=\\sqrt{(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{\\mathrm{d} s} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} s}{\\mathrm{d} t})^2+(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} q}{\\mathrm{d} s} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} s}{\\mathrm{d} t})^2} \\\\ \u0026=\\sqrt{(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{\\mathrm{d} s})^2+(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} q}{\\mathrm{d} s})^2} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} s}{\\mathrm{d} t} \\end{align} $$Since $\\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{\\mathrm{d} t} \\ne 0$, it follows that $\\frac{\\mathrm{d} s}{\\mathrm{d} t} \\ne 0$:\n$$ \\sqrt{(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{\\mathrm{d} s})^2+(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} q}{\\mathrm{d} s})^2} = 1 $$This proof shows that under arc length parametrization, the velocity vector $\\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\boldsymbol{p}}{\\mathrm{d} s}$ has a constant length of $1$.\nQuestion 2 Generally, for a unit vector with an angle $\\theta$ relative to the $x$-axis, the components are:\n$$ v_x = \\cos(\\theta) \\\\ v_y = \\sin(\\theta) $$From Q1, we know $\\begin{vmatrix} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\boldsymbol{p}}{\\mathrm{d} s} \\end{vmatrix} = 1$, so:\n$$ \\begin{align} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\boldsymbol{p}}{\\mathrm{d} s} \u0026= (\\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{\\mathrm{d} s},\\frac{\\mathrm{d} q}{\\mathrm{d} s}) \\\\ \u0026= (\\cos(\\theta(s)), \\sin(\\theta(s))) \\end{align} $$Differentiating the components with respect to $s$:\n$$ \\begin{align} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 p}{\\mathrm{d} s^2} \u0026= -\\sin(\\theta(s)) \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\theta}{\\mathrm{d} s} \\\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 q}{\\mathrm{d} s^2} \u0026= \\cos(\\theta(s)) \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\theta}{\\mathrm{d} s} \\end{align} $$Therefore:\n$$ \\begin{align} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{\\mathrm{d} s} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 q}{\\mathrm{d} s^2}-\\frac{\\mathrm{d} q}{\\mathrm{d} s}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 p}{\\mathrm{d} s^2} \u0026= \\cos(\\theta(s)) \\cdot \\cos(\\theta(s)) \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\theta}{\\mathrm{d} s} - \\sin(\\theta(s)) \\cdot (-\\sin(\\theta(s)) \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\theta}{\\mathrm{d} s}) \\\\ \u0026= (\\cos^2\\theta(s) + \\sin^2\\theta(s)) \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\theta}{\\mathrm{d} s} \\\\ \u0026= \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\theta}{\\mathrm{d} s} \\end{align} $$Question 3 Since $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is a smooth convex curve, the change in the tangent angle is continuous and does not reverse (it\u0026rsquo;s monotonic). Because it moves counter-clockwise, the angle $\\theta$ with the $x$-axis is constantly increasing. Therefore, its derivative is always non-negative: $\\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\theta}{\\mathrm{d} s} \\ge 0$.\nQuestion 4 Since $\\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\boldsymbol{p}}{\\mathrm{d} s}$ is the unit tangent vector and $\\boldsymbol{u} (s)$ is the outward unit normal vector:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{u} (s) = (\\frac{\\mathrm{d} q}{\\mathrm{d} s},-\\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{\\mathrm{d} s}) $$Take the partial derivatives of $\\boldsymbol{x}$ with respect to $s$ and $r$:\n$$ \\begin{align} \\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{x}}{\\partial s} \u0026= \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\boldsymbol{p}}{\\mathrm{d} s} + r\\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\boldsymbol{u}}{\\mathrm{d} s} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{x}}{\\partial r} \u0026= \\boldsymbol{u} (s) \\end{align} $$Components for $x$:\n$$ \\begin{align} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial s} \u0026= \\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{\\mathrm{d} s} + r\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 q}{\\mathrm{d} s^2} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial r} \u0026= \\frac{\\mathrm{d} q}{\\mathrm{d} s} \\end{align} $$Components for $y$:\n$$ \\begin{align} \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial s} \u0026= \\frac{\\mathrm{d} q}{\\mathrm{d} s} - r\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 p}{\\mathrm{d} s^2} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial r} \u0026= -\\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{\\mathrm{d} s} \\end{align} $$The Jacobian matrix becomes:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial s} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial r} \\ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial s} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial r} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{\\mathrm{d} s} + r\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 q}{\\mathrm{d} s^2} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\mathrm{d} q}{\\mathrm{d} s} \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{d} q}{\\mathrm{d} s} - r\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 p}{\\mathrm{d} s^2} \u0026amp; -\\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{\\mathrm{d} s} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nCalculating the determinant:\n$$ \\begin{align} \\det\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{\\mathrm{d} s} + r\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 q}{\\mathrm{d} s^2} \u0026 \\frac{\\mathrm{d} q}{\\mathrm{d} s} \\\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{d} q}{\\mathrm{d} s} - r\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 p}{\\mathrm{d} s^2} \u0026 -\\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{\\mathrm{d} s} \\end{pmatrix} \u0026= (\\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{\\mathrm{d} s} + r\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 q}{\\mathrm{d} s^2})(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{\\mathrm{d} s})-(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} q}{\\mathrm{d} s} - r\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 p}{\\mathrm{d} s^2})(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} q}{\\mathrm{d} s}) \\\\ \u0026= -(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{\\mathrm{d} s})^2 -r\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 q}{\\mathrm{d} s^2}\\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{\\mathrm{d} s}-(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} q}{\\mathrm{d} s})^2+r\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 p}{\\mathrm{d} s^2}\\frac{\\mathrm{d} q}{\\mathrm{d} s} \\\\ \u0026= -[(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{\\mathrm{d} s})^2+(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} q}{\\mathrm{d} s})^2]-r(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 q}{\\mathrm{d} s^2}\\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{\\mathrm{d} s}-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 p}{\\mathrm{d} s^2}\\frac{\\mathrm{d} q}{\\mathrm{d} s}) \\end{align} $$Using the results from Q1 and Q2:\n$$ \\begin{align} \\left | \\det\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{\\mathrm{d} s} + r\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 q}{\\mathrm{d} s^2} \u0026 \\frac{\\mathrm{d} q}{\\mathrm{d} s} \\\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{d} q}{\\mathrm{d} s} - r\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 p}{\\mathrm{d} s^2} \u0026 -\\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{\\mathrm{d} s} \\end{pmatrix} \\right | \u0026= \\left | -1-r\\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\theta}{\\mathrm{d} s} \\right | \\\\ \u0026= 1+r\\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\theta}{\\mathrm{d} s} \\end{align} $$Note: The matrix involved here is the Jacobian matrix .\nQuestion 5 This proof is easiest to understand with a diagram.\nThe blue area is $A$, the area of $K$.

Feels like the difficulty of the intermediate Software Designer (SoftQual) level. There are four exam sessions total, though; no idea when I\u0026rsquo;ll wrap up this first one.\nQuestion 6 一つの $I^2C$ バスに接続された二つのセンサがある。それぞれのセンサ値を読み込む二つのタスで排他的に制御したい。利用するリアルタイムOSの機能として、適切なものはどれか。\nア　キュー\nイ　セマフォ\nウ　マルチスレッド\nエ　ラウンドロビン\nQuestion translation: Two sensors share an I²C bus. To ensure two tasks read their sensor values exclusively, which RTOS feature is appropriate?\nA: Queue\nB: Semaphore\nC: Multithreading\nD: Round Robin\nA queue is a FIFO data structure, good for inter-task communication or data passing.\nA semaphore is a sync mechanism, mainly for controlling shared resource access. It prevents multiple tasks from touching the same resource concurrently. We have binary semaphores (for exclusive access) and counting semaphores (for managing resource pools).\nMultithreading means running multiple threads concurrently within one process. By itself, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t handle exclusive control. You usually pair it with semaphores or mutexes for safe shared resource access.\nRound-robin is a simple task scheduling algorithm, like time-slice round robin.\nThe options themselves are okay, but being all katakana definitely cranks up the difficulty. So, for this one, it\u0026rsquo;s option B.\nQuestion 7 アクチュエータの説明として、適切なものはどれか。\nア　与えられた目標量と、センサから得られた制御量に比較し、制御量を目標量に一致させるように操作量を出力する。\nイ　位置、角度、速度、加速度、力、温度などを検出し、電気的な情報に変換する。\nウ　エネルギー源からのパワーを、回転、直進などの働きに変換する。\nエ　マイクロフォン、センサなどが出力する微小な電気信号を増幅する。\nQuestion translation: Which statement correctly describes an actuator?\nA: Compares a target value with a sensor-read control value, then outputs an operating variable to match the control value to the target.\nB: Detects position, angle, speed, acceleration, force, temperature, etc., and converts them to electrical signals.\nC: Converts power from an energy source into work, like rotation or linear motion.\nD: Amplifies weak electrical signals from devices like microphones or sensors.\nA describes a controller, typically for closed-loop systems. B is a sensor\u0026rsquo;s job: turning physical quantities into electrical signals. C is what an actuator does. D is an amplifier. So, C is the correct choice.\nQuestion 8 第1、第2、第3正規形とリレーションの特徴 a, b, c の組合のうち、適切なものはどれか。\na：どの非キー属性も、主キーの真部分集合に対して関数従属しない。\nb：どの非キー属性も、主キーに推移的に関数従属しない。\nc：繰り返し属性が存在しない。\n第1正規形 第2正規形 第3正規形 ア a b c イ a c b ウ c a b エ c b a Question translation: Which combination correctly maps 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF to characteristics a, b, c?\na: No non-key attribute depends on a proper subset of the primary key (partial dependency).\nb: No non-key attribute transitively depends on the primary key via other non-key attributes (transitive dependency).\nc: No repeating attributes.\nYeah, these are just database normal forms (though \u0026lsquo;regular form\u0026rsquo; sounds a bit off). I even wrote a post about them . Checking the summary section , 1NF maps to c, 2NF to a, and 3NF to b.

B describes a data mart: pulling specific data from a data warehouse for particular uses. C is a data model\u0026rsquo;s definition. D is data replication/backup. So, option A is the one.\nQuestion 10 UDPを使用しているものはどれか。\nア　FTP\nイ　NTP\nウ　POP３\nエ　TELNET\nQuestion translation: Which of these uses the UDP protocol?\nFTP (File Transfer Protocol) uses TCP for reliable data transfer.

After the weekend, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to get into the groove. But for some reason today, my mood suddenly flipped from feeling almost depressed to being super optimistic—even though I didn\u0026rsquo;t actually do anything. Emotions and mental states are weird.\nSo, I slacked off a bit today and almost skipped writing this. But this paper has 30 questions; at my current pace, it\u0026rsquo;s going to take at least half a month to finish. :cry:\nQuestion 3 ポログラム言語のうち、ブロックの範囲を指定する方法として特定の記号や予約語を用いず、等しい文字数の字下げを用いるという特征をもつものはどれか。\nア　C\nイ　Java\nウ　PHP\nエ　Python\nTranslation: Which programming language is characterized by using indentation of a specific number of characters to define the scope of a code block, rather than using specific symbols or reserved words?\nClearly Python, which is option エ.\nQuestion 4 キャッシュメモリのアクセス時間が主記憶のアクセス時間の1/30で、ヒット率が95％のとき、実効メモリアクセス時間は、主記憶のアクセス時間の約何と何倍になるか。\nア　0.03\nイ　0.08\nウ　0.37\nエ　0.95\nThis question tests Effective Memory Access Time (EMAT), calculated using the following formula:\n$$ EMAT = Cache Access Time \\times Hit Rate + Main Memory Access Time \\times Miss Rate $$Let Main Memory Access Time = $T$. Then Cache Access Time = $\\frac{T}{30}$. From the question, Hit Rate = 95%, so Miss Rate = 5%.\nSo, $EMAT = \\frac{T}{30} \\times 95\\% + T \\times 5\\% \\approx 0.08T$. The answer is option イ.\nTo be honest, I\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten most of my computer organization coursework, so I had to brush up on this.\nQuestion 5 プロセッサ数と、計算処理におけるプロセスの並列化が可能な部分の割合とが、性能上へ及ぼす影響に関する記述のうち、アムダールの法則に基づいたものはどれか。\nア　全ての計算処理が並列化できる場合、速度向上比は、プロセッサ数を増やしてもある水準に漸近的に近づく。\nイ　並列化できない計算処理がある場合、速度向上比は、プロセッサ数に比例して増加する。\nウ　並列化できない計算処理がある場合、速度向上比は、プロセッサ数を増やしてもある水準に漸近的に近づく。\nエ　並列化できる計算処理の割合が増えると、速度向上比は、プロセッサ数に反比例して減少する。\nTranslation: Regarding the impact of the number of processors and the proportion of parallelizable parts of a computation on performance, which description is based on Amdahl\u0026rsquo;s Law?\nア: If all computation can be parallelized, the speedup ratio will asymptotically approach a certain level even if the number of processors is increased.\nイ: If there is computation that cannot be parallelized, the speedup ratio increases proportionally with the number of processors.\nウ: If there is computation that cannot be parallelized, the speedup ratio will asymptotically approach a certain level even if the number of processors is increased.\nエ: As the proportion of parallelizable computation increases, the speedup ratio decreases in inverse proportion to the number of processors.\nTo solve this, you need to know Amdahl\u0026rsquo;s Law. It describes how the degree of parallelization in a program limits the performance gain from adding more processors. It states that the non-parallelizable portion of the program will eventually bottleneck the performance improvement. The formula is:\n$$ S(N)=\\frac{1}{(1-P)+\\frac{P}{N}} $$Where:\n$S(N)$ is the speedup ratio using $N$ processors. $P$ is the proportion of the program that can be parallelized. $N$ is the number of processors.

To be honest, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if I\u0026rsquo;ll pass. A lot of the knowledge required for this cert might not seem useful in day-to-day coding (actually, it is, we just don\u0026rsquo;t realize it), but having it is better than not. I\u0026rsquo;ll try my best to finish this past paper. Hopefully, this process helps snap me back into reality.\nRamblings I\u0026rsquo;ve been in a bit of a slump for the past two years, and it\u0026rsquo;s definitely affected how I handle things. I can\u0026rsquo;t keep going like this. Since I can\u0026rsquo;t change the past, I\u0026rsquo;ll just do my best with what\u0026rsquo;s ahead. I want to at least give it a shot; the scariest thing is losing the courage to try, which already cost me an opportunity recently. I need some change to feel like I\u0026rsquo;m actually \u0026ldquo;living\u0026rdquo; again. Sometimes it feels like I\u0026rsquo;m living in a dream—not a good one, just an unrealistic one. Words are limited; actual experience is more convincing, even if it\u0026rsquo;s a fabricated reality. I\u0026rsquo;m starting to believe some pretty far-fetched things.\nEmm, this feels like a diary entry. Oh well, it is what it is.\nThe mention of feeling like I\u0026rsquo;m in a dream reminds me of a cultivation novel where a member of a demonic sect believes they are an immortal, that the current world is just an illusion, and they are only there for a trial. Sometimes I feel like that setting has influenced me too. Anyway, enough nonsense.\nQuestion 1 A Hamming code is created by adding redundancy bits to data to allow for 1-bit error correction. Consider a Hamming code $X_1X_2X_3P_3X_4P_2P_1$ consisting of 4 bits of data $X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4$ and 3 redundancy bits $P_3, P_2, P_1$. The added bits $P_1, P_2, P_3$ are determined as follows:\n$$ X_1 \\oplus X_3 \\oplus X_4 \\oplus P_1 = 0 \\\\ X_1 \\oplus X_2 \\oplus X_4 \\oplus P_2 = 0 \\\\ X_1 \\oplus X_2 \\oplus X_3 \\oplus P_3 = 0 $$Where $\\oplus$ represents the XOR (exclusive OR) operation.\nThe Hamming code 1110011 contains a 1-bit error. Which of the following is the corrected Hamming code?\nA. 0110011\nB. 1010011\nC. 1100011\nD. 1110111\nThis is a Hamming code problem. The question provides the formulas. Substituting the values into the XOR equations:\n$$ X_1 \\oplus X_3 \\oplus X_4 \\oplus P_1 = 1 \\\\ X_1 \\oplus X_2 \\oplus X_4 \\oplus P_2 = 1 \\\\ X_1 \\oplus X_2 \\oplus X_3 \\oplus P_3 = 1 $$The result of the check is $(111)_2$, which indicates the error is at the 7th bit. Therefore, the correct data is 0110011, which corresponds to option A (ア).\nWhen I saw \u0026ldquo;Hamming code,\u0026rdquo; it felt familiar, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t remember the details. Man, what was I even studying before?\nHamming codes are used to detect and correct single-bit errors. For example, to convert the original data 1100 into a Hamming code:\nFirst, calculate the number of parity bits using $2^k \\ge k + m + 1$, where $m$ is the number of data bits and $k$ is the number of parity bits. In this case, $k$ should be 3. Parity bits are placed at positions $2^n$ (1, 2, 4, 8\u0026hellip;). So here, parity bits are at positions 1, 2, and 4. Position numbering usually goes from right to left.\nWith 3 parity bits and 4 data bits, there are 7 positions total. Let\u0026rsquo;s list their binary representations (3 bits):\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 111 110 101 100 011 010 001 The parity bit positions (1, 2, 4) correspond to 001, 010, and 100. This means position 1 tracks bits with a \u0026lsquo;1\u0026rsquo; in the first binary digit, position 2 tracks the second, and position 4 tracks the third.\nParity Bit Position \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo; bit location Covered Positions 1 1st bit, **1 1, 3, 5, 7 2 2nd bit, *1* 2, 3, 6, 7 4 3rd bit, 1** 4, 5, 6, 7 Now, determine the value of the parity bits based on the original data so that each group has an even number of 1s (even parity):\nPosition 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Value 1 1 0 0 (Leaving parity bits blank for now)\nGroup 1 (bits 1, 3, 5, 7): Contains one \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo;. Add 1 to make it even. Group 2 (bits 2, 3, 6, 7): Contains two \u0026ldquo;1\u0026quot;s. Add 0. Group 3 (bits 4, 5, 6, 7): Contains two \u0026ldquo;1\u0026quot;s. Add 0.\nThe resulting Hamming code is:\nPosition 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Value 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 So 1100 becomes 1100001. The verification process is the same as the question.\nTo check for errors: Perform the XOR check for each group. If the results are all 0, there\u0026rsquo;s no error. If not, the resulting binary number (Group 3, Group 2, Group 1) points to the position of the flipped bit.\nReferences:\nUnderstanding Hamming Codes Hamming Code Encoding and Verification Exclusive OR (XOR) Question 2 Lists can be implemented using either arrays or pointers. Which of the following is a characteristic of a list implemented using an array? Here, an array-based list stores elements contiguously, while a pointer-based list uses elements and pointers to the next element.\nA. Regardless of the actual number of elements, space for the maximum possible number of elements must be allocated, which may result in unused memory.\nB. To reference a middle element, you must traverse the list from the beginning, requiring time proportional to the number of elements.\nC. In addition to the space for storing elements, extra space is required to store pointers to the next element.\nD. If the insertion point is known, elements can be inserted in constant time regardless of the actual number of elements in the list.\nThis question asks about the characteristics of an array-based list implementation. Options B, C, and D are characteristics of linked lists (pointer-based). The correct answer is A.\nThe logic is straightforward; if I got it wrong, it\u0026rsquo;s only because I couldn\u0026rsquo;t read the Japanese :cry:. Here is the translation breakdown:\nA: Max size must be pre-allocated regardless of actual usage, leading to potential waste. (Array trait)\nB: Accessing an element requires O(n) traversal.

Might add more if I find time.\nProblem 1: This Article\nProblem 2: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/187 Problem 3: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/188 Lately, I felt like my studies weren\u0026rsquo;t sticking, even after attending lectures. So I decided to tackle some problems (yeah, studying without doing problems might seem weird, but it felt normal then, probably just laziness). Turns out, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t solve them. But looking up solutions triggered memories from past courses, so I basically re-learned everything as I worked through this.\nAlso, no official solutions meant I had to compute the first three problems with Python; those answers should be solid. But the last two are proofs, so I can\u0026rsquo;t guarantee my derivations are flawless.\nProblem Source: https://www.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/edu/entra/examarchive.shtml Problems are copyrighted by the University of Tokyo; cited here for convenience, non-profit use only.\nLet square matrices $A, B$ be defined as:\n$$ A=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \u0026 \\sqrt{2} \u0026 0 \\\\ \\sqrt{2} \u0026 1 \u0026 \\sqrt{2} \\\\ 0 \u0026 \\sqrt{2} \u0026 1 \\end{pmatrix}, B=\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \u0026 -\\frac{2}{3} \u0026 \\frac{1}{3} \\\\ \\frac{2}{3} \u0026 0 \u0026 -\\frac{2}{3} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{3} \u0026 \\frac{2}{3} \u0026 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$Also, let $I$ be the identity matrix. For a real square matrix $X$, $\\exp(X)$ is defined as:\n$$ \\exp(X)=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}(\\frac{1}{k!}X^{k})=I+X+\\frac{1}{2!}X^{2}+\\frac{1}{3!}X^{3}+\\cdots $$When defined this way, answer the following questions.\n（1）Find all eigenvalues of $A$ and their corresponding eigenvectors. For eigenvectors, choose those with a norm of $1$ and a non-negative real first element.\n（2）Find $A^{n}$ for a non-negative integer $n$.\n（3）Find $\\exp(A)$.\n（4）Show that when $\\alpha$ is a real number, $\\exp(\\alpha B)$ can be expressed by the following equation:\n$$ \\exp(\\alpha B) = I + (\\sin\\alpha)B + (1-\\cos(\\alpha))B^{2} $$You may use the Cayley-Hamilton theorem.\n（5）Given a 3-dimensional real vector $a$, define the function $f$ for a 3-dimensional real vector $x$ as:\n$$ f(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\left \\| \\exp(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}B)a - x \\right \\|^{2} $$Let $n \\ge 2$. Show that $f$ is minimized at $x=(I+B^{2})a$.\nProblem 1 Problem: Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $A$ (eigenvectors should have a norm of 1 and a non-negative first element).\nConstruct the matrix and calculate its determinant based on the characteristic equation $\\det(A-\\lambda I) = 0$. The characteristic equation is:\n$$ \\det(A-\\lambda I) =\\begin{vmatrix} 1-\\lambda \u0026 \\sqrt{2} \u0026 0 \\\\ \\sqrt{2} \u0026 1-\\lambda \u0026 \\sqrt{2} \\\\ 0 \u0026 \\sqrt{2} \u0026 1-\\lambda \\end{vmatrix} = 0 $$Expanding along the first row yields:\n$$ (1-\\lambda)[(1-\\lambda)^{2}-2]-\\sqrt{2}[\\sqrt{2}(1-\\lambda)]=0 $$Solving gives:\n$$ \\lambda_{1}=1, \\lambda_{2}=-1, \\lambda_{3}=3 $$Next, find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue. For $\\lambda_{1}=1$:\n$$ (A-\\lambda_{1}I) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \u0026 \\sqrt{2} \u0026 0 \\\\ \\sqrt{2} \u0026 0 \u0026 \\sqrt{2} \\\\ 0 \u0026 \\sqrt{2} \u0026 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$Solving the equation $(A-\\lambda_{1}I)\\mathbf{v}_{1}=0$ yields the eigenvector:\n$$ \\mathbf{v}_{1}=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$For $\\lambda_{2}=-1$:\n$$ (A-\\lambda_{2}I)=\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \u0026 \\sqrt{2} \u0026 0 \\\\ \\sqrt{2} \u0026 2 \u0026 \\sqrt{2} \\\\ 0 \u0026 \\sqrt{2} \u0026 2 \\end{pmatrix} $$Solving the equation $(A-\\lambda_{2}I)\\mathbf{v}_{2}=0$ yields the eigenvector:\n$$ \\mathbf{v}_{2}=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$For $\\lambda_{3}=3$:\n$$ (A-\\lambda_{3}I)=\\begin{pmatrix} -2 \u0026 \\sqrt{2} \u0026 0 \\\\ \\sqrt{2} \u0026 -2 \u0026 \\sqrt{2} \\\\ 0 \u0026 \\sqrt{2} \u0026 -2 \\end{pmatrix} $$Solving the equation $(A-\\lambda_{3}I)\\mathbf{v}_{3}=0$ yields the eigenvector:\n$$ \\mathbf{v}_{3}=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\sqrt{2} \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$Normalizing the eigenvectors, here\u0026rsquo;s the summary:\n$$ \\begin{align*} \\text{Eigenvalues}\u0026: \\lambda_{1}=1, \\lambda_{2}=-1, \\lambda_{3}=3 \\\\ \\text{Eigenvectors}\u0026: \\mathbf{v}_{1}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\mathbf{v}_{2}=\\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\mathbf{v}_{3}=\\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\sqrt{2} \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\end{align*} $$Python Code Verify the results with sympy:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 import sympy as sp # Define matrix A A = sp.Matrix([[1, sp.sqrt(2), 0], [sp.sqrt(2), 1, sp.sqrt(2)], [0, sp.sqrt(2), 1]]) # Calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors eigenvals = A.eigenvals() # eigenvalues eigenvects = A.eigenvects() # eigenvectors print(f\u0026#34;Eigenvalues of A:\u0026#34;) sp.pprint(eigenvals) print(f\u0026#34;Eigenvectors of A:\u0026#34;) sp.pprint(eigenvects) Output is as follows:\nProblem 2 Problem: Find $A^{n}$ ($n$ is a non-negative integer).\nBy diagonalization theory, matrix $A$ decomposes into $A=SDS^{-1}$.

When I pulled out my ancient setup USB drive, the software inside was pretty outdated—some wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even run on a modern system, and for others, I’ve found better alternatives. I\u0026rsquo;m writing this article to document the software I used for this 2024 build.\nLooking back, I actually started this on 2024.09.16. Life got in the way, and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t in the best state, so it took until 2024.10.02 to finally finish this post.\nSystem Since I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Windows 11 for a while, I decided to stick with it. My USB image was too old, so I downloaded a fresh one from MSDN itellyou .\nHowever, I discovered that Windows now forces an internet connection during setup—you\u0026rsquo;re basically required to log in with a Microsoft account. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have internet, it\u0026rsquo;s best to use an older version (which might still allow skipping) or install Win10 first and then upgrade (lol).\n2024.10.03\nToday I came across two methods to skip network verification . Haven\u0026rsquo;t tried them yet, but documenting them here:\nPress Ctrl+Shift+F3 to skip directly and avoid creating a local user (the setup will restart on the next reboot). On the network connection screen, press Shift+F10 and enter oobe\\bypassnro.cmd. The system will reboot, and an \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t have internet\u0026rdquo; option will appear. Software My setup drive hadn\u0026rsquo;t been touched in ages. Some apps are no longer in my workflow, and I\u0026rsquo;ve adopted new ones that replace old functionality. It\u0026rsquo;s worth documenting this; who knows if I\u0026rsquo;ll have a completely different set of tools the next time I reinstall (though I\u0026rsquo;m starting to prefer keeping things simple).\nOffice Suite Basic Office is essential. I use Office Tool Plus for a quick and clean installation.\nI only install Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.\nDownload Office Tool: https://otp.landian.vip/zh-cn/download.html Launch Office Tool and run this code to install:\n1 deploy /add O365ProPlusRetail_zh-cn /O365ProPlusRetail.exclapps Access,Bing,Groove,Lync,OneDrive,OneNote,Outlook,Publisher,Teams /channel Current /dlfirst Activate Office using KMS:\n1 2 3 ospp /inslicid MondoVolume /sethst:kms.loli.beer /setprt:1688 /act # or use kms.03k.org ospp /inslicid MondoVolume /sethst:kms.03k.org /setprt:1688 /act References:\nhttps://www.coolhub.top/archives/11 https://www.coolhub.top/archives/14 Download Tools \u0026amp; Cloud Storage Thunder (迅雷): Using a lite version I found somewhere. It\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;leech\u0026rdquo; client, but it\u0026rsquo;s still necessary for some specific downloads.\nBitComet: BitTorrent client, also using a lite version. Alternatives include qBittorrent, µTorrent, etc.\nResilio Sync : P2P-based sync software, great for keeping files synced across devices.\nInternet Download Manager (IDM): The gold standard for multi-threaded downloads.\n115 : Good for downloading stubborn BT links. Similar to Pikpak.\nBaidu Netdisk : Great if you have a subscription, a nightmare if you don\u0026rsquo;t. Pay for speed. Others like Alibaba Drive or Quark can be downloaded as needed.\nSocial Media Standard stuff.\nTencent:\nQQ : The recent NT version is actually quite decent. WeChat: https://www.wechat.com/ Telegram: https://desktop.telegram.org/ Compression Tools I used to have a ton of these, but I only really use two now.\nBandizip : Very popular; even my school labs use it now.\nWinRAR: Ancient, but some RAR files still require it for proper extraction.\nOthers:\n7zip : The most popular open-source option. NanaZip : A stylized 7zip that integrates into the Windows 11 primary context menu. Miscellaneous Tools uTools : An extremely convenient productivity tool. It uses plugins to expand functionality. In fact, I wrote this post using its Markdown extension—not quite Typora, but very handy.\nQuickLook : Quick file preview tool. It\u0026rsquo;s not perfect; I\u0026rsquo;m looking for a better alternative. The portable version requires a workaround: https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook/issues/1 1Password : Password manager. An open-source alternative is Bitwarden . I can\u0026rsquo;t live without a password manager anymore.\nPDF Readers: Most are similar, I use whatever\u0026rsquo;s handy:\nFoxit PDF Wondershare PDFelement PDF X-Change Sandboxie Plus : Great for running apps without cluttering the system. The portable version requires admin rights every time.\nTickTick : To-Do list with cross-platform sync. Sync has felt a bit sluggish lately, though.\nQuiteRSS : RSS feed manager. The UI is dated, but I\u0026rsquo;m used to it. Since it\u0026rsquo;s portable, moving my feeds is just a matter of copy-paste.\nDuplicate Cleaner Pro: Couldn\u0026rsquo;t find my old cleaner, so I\u0026rsquo;m using Bajian\u0026rsquo;s version. It takes some getting used to, but it works.\nPixPin : Screenshot tool.\nCode Tools VS Code : Essential.\nTypora : The best Markdown editor.\nGit: https://git-scm.com/downloads/win Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to config your name and email after installing.

Starting from the first queen, try each column in its corresponding row (the $i$-th queen corresponds to the $i$-th row) starting from the first column. If a position is valid (no attacks), place the queen and move to the next queen. If it conflicts with existing queens, try the next column. If all columns in the current row are exhausted, backtrack to the previous queen and move it to its next possible column.

It worked fine over HTTP. Since my previous non-Docker deployment didn\u0026rsquo;t have this issue, I initially suspected a Docker networking problem. At the time, I only needed to make a one-off update, so I just disabled HTTPS, finished the changes, and left it. Now that I\u0026rsquo;m using Typecho again and need to post regularly, it\u0026rsquo;s time to fix it properly.\nSolution The fix is straightforward. Add the following line to the end of your data/config.inc.php file:\n1 define(\u0026#39;__TYPECHO_SECURE__\u0026#39;, true); Then, restart the service.\nRoot Cause Analysis According to the reference materials, the issue stems from the interaction between the user, the browser, and the server. While the browser communicates with a proxy (like Cloudflare) via HTTPS, PHP receives an HTTP request from the proxy. PHP then responds using HTTP, which causes the login failure.\nReferences Typecho HTTPS 无法登陆后台 ","date":"2024-07-26T22:22:22+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/175/","title":"Cannot Login to Typecho Admin via HTTPS"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash ElementUI, built by the Ele.me team, is a desktop UI component library for developers, designers, and product managers, powered by Vue 2.0.\nComponents are the building blocks of a webpage, like links, buttons, images, tables, forms, and pagination.\nVue2.x Official Site: International Mainland China Vue3.x Official Site: https://element-plus.org/zh-CN/#/zh-CN ElementUI Installation Install the ElementUI library (in your current project directory) using this command:\n1 npm install element-ui@2.15.3 Import the ElementUI component library:\n1 2 3 4 import ElementUI from \u0026#39;element-ui\u0026#39;; import \u0026#39;element-ui/lib/theme-chalk/index.css\u0026#39;; Vue.use(ElementUI); Getting Started Create the src/views/element/elementView.vue component.

It handles the following:\nAuthentication and Authorization: As the microservice entry, the gateway verifies if a user is authorized to make a request. If not, it blocks the request. Request Routing, Load Balancing: All requests must pass through the gateway first. The gateway doesn\u0026rsquo;t handle business logic directly. Instead, it forwards requests to a specific microservice based on defined rules – that\u0026rsquo;s routing. If multiple target services are available for a route, load balancing is also applied. Request Rate Limiting: When traffic is too high, the gateway throttles requests to match the downstream microservice\u0026rsquo;s capacity, preventing services from getting overloaded. Spring Cloud offers two gateway implementations:\nZuul: Built on Servlet, uses blocking I/O. SpringCloudGateway: Based on Spring5\u0026rsquo;s WebFlux, it\u0026rsquo;s a reactive programming implementation with better performance. Getting Started Create a project and add the dependencies:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 \u0026lt;!-- Gateway --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.cloud\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-cloud-starter-gateway\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Nacos service discovery dependency --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;com.alibaba.cloud\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-cloud-starter-alibaba-nacos-discovery\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; Write the basic configuration and routing rules:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 server: port: 10010 # Gateway port spring: application: name: gateway # Service name cloud: nacos: server-addr: localhost:8848 # Nacos address gateway: routes: # Gateway routing configuration - id: user-service # Route ID, custom, must be unique # uri: http://127.0.0.1:8081 # Target address for the route. \u0026#39;http\u0026#39; means a fixed address. uri: lb://userService # Target address for the route. \u0026#39;lb\u0026#39; means load balancing, followed by the service name. predicates: # Route predicates, conditions to determine if a request matches the route. - Path=/user/** # This matches by path. Any path starting with /user/ will match. Then, visit localhost:10010/user/1 to test it.\nRouting configuration includes:\nRoute ID: The unique identifier for the route. Route Target (URI): The target address for the route. \u0026lsquo;http\u0026rsquo; means a fixed address, \u0026rsquo;lb\u0026rsquo; means load balancing based on service name. Route Predicates: Rules that determine if a request matches the route. If it matches, the request is forwarded to the route\u0026rsquo;s destination. Route Filters: Process requests or responses. Predicate Factories The predicate rules defined in the configuration are just strings. These strings are read and processed by Predicate Factories, turning them into conditions for route matching.\nFor example, the Path=/user/** rule from above matches by path and is handled by the org.springframework.cloud.gateway.handler.predicate.PathRoutePredicateFactory class. Similar predicate factories include:\nName Description Example After Requests after a certain time - After=2037-01-20T17:42:47.789-07:00[America/Denver] Before Requests before a certain time - Before=2031-04-13T15:14:47.433+08:00[Asia/Shanghai] Between Requests between two specific times - Between=2037-01-20T17:42:47.789-07:00[America/Denver], 2037-01-21T17:42:47.789-07:00[America/Denver] Cookie Request must include certain cookies - Cookie=chocolate, ch.p Header Request must include certain headers - Header=X-Request-Id, \\d+ Host Request must be for a specific host (domain) - Host=.somehost.org,.anotherhost.org Method Request method must be specified - Method=GET,POST Path Request path must match specified rules - Path=/red/{segment},/blue/** Query Request parameters must include specified parameters - Query=name, Jack or - Query=name RemoteAddr Requester\u0026rsquo;s IP must be within a specified range - RemoteAddr=192.168.1.1/24 Weight Weight handling Filter Factories A GatewayFilter is a type of filter provided in the gateway that can process requests entering the gateway and responses returned by microservices.\nSpring provides 31 different route filter factories, for example:\nName Description AddRequestHeader Adds a request header to the current request RemoveRequestHeader Removes a request header from the request AddResponseHeader Adds a response header to the response RemoveResponseHeader Removes a response header from the response RequestRateLimiter Limits request traffic For more details, see: https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-gateway/reference/spring-cloud-gateway/gatewayfilter-factories.html Request Header Filter Let\u0026rsquo;s take the request header filter as an example: add a request header \u0026lsquo;Hello=World\u0026rsquo; to all requests going to \u0026lsquo;userService\u0026rsquo;.\nModify application.yml in your gateway project to add a route filter:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 spring: cloud: gateway: routes: - id: user-service uri: lb://userservice predicates: - Path=/user/** filters: # Filters - AddRequestHeader=Hello, World # Add request header Then, you can modify the Controller to test it:\n1 2 3 4 5 @GetMapping(\u0026#34;/{id}\u0026#34;) public User queryById(@PathVariable(\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;) Long id, @RequestHeader(\u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;) String hello) { System.out.println(hello); return userService.queryById(id); } Default Filters If you want a filter factory to apply to all routes, you can put it under \u0026lsquo;default-filters\u0026rsquo;.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 spring: cloud: gateway: routes: - id: user-service uri: lb://userservice predicates: - Path=/user/** default-filters: # Default filter items - AddRequestHeader=Hello, World Global Filters The gateway provides 31 types of filters, but each has a fixed purpose. If we want to intercept requests and implement our own custom business logic, these fixed filters won\u0026rsquo;t cut it.\nGlobal Filters, on the other hand, also process all requests entering the gateway and responses from microservices, just like GatewayFilters. The difference is that GatewayFilters are configuration-driven with fixed logic, while GlobalFilter logic requires custom code by implementing the GlobalFilter interface.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 public interface GlobalFilter { /** * Processes the current request. If necessary, it passes the request to the next filter via {@link GatewayFilterChain}. * * @param exchange The request context, where you can get Request, Response, and other info. * @param chain Used to delegate the request to the next filter. * @return {@code Mono\u0026lt;Void\u0026gt;} Returns to indicate the current filter\u0026#39;s business logic is complete. */ Mono\u0026lt;Void\u0026gt; filter(ServerWebExchange exchange, GatewayFilterChain chain); } By writing custom logic in the filter, you can achieve the following functionalities:\nLogin status check Permission validation Request rate limiting, etc. Basic Usage Goal: Define a global filter to intercept requests and check if the request parameters meet the following conditions:\nDoes the parameter contain \u0026lsquo;authorization\u0026rsquo;? Is the \u0026lsquo;authorization\u0026rsquo; parameter value \u0026lsquo;admin\u0026rsquo;? If both conditions are met, proceed; otherwise, block the request.\nFirst, define a filter in the gateway:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 @Order(-1) // Process first @Component public class AuthorizeFilter implements GlobalFilter { @Override public Mono\u0026lt;Void\u0026gt; filter(ServerWebExchange exchange, GatewayFilterChain chain) { // Get request parameters MultiValueMap\u0026lt;String, String\u0026gt; params = exchange.getRequest().getQueryParams(); // Get the \u0026#39;AuthorizeFilter\u0026#39; parameter. Here, we assume the first one is the authentication parameter. String authorize = params.getFirst(\u0026#34;AuthorizeFilter\u0026#34;); // Check if(\u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;.equals(authorize)){ // Proceed return chain.filter(exchange); } // Intercept, forbid access exchange.getResponse().setStatusCode(HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN); // Finish processing return exchange.getResponse().setComplete(); } } Filter Execution Order When a request enters the gateway, it encounters three types of filters: current route filters, Default Filters, and Global Filters.\nAfter routing, the current route filters, Default Filters, and Global Filters are merged into a single filter chain (collection). They are then sorted and executed sequentially.\nEach filter has an integer \u0026lsquo;order\u0026rsquo; value. A smaller \u0026lsquo;order\u0026rsquo; value means higher priority and earlier execution.\nThe \u0026lsquo;order\u0026rsquo; values for route filters and default filters are assigned by Spring, defaulting to an incrementing sequence starting from 1.\nGlobalFilters can specify their \u0026lsquo;order\u0026rsquo; value by implementing the \u0026lsquo;Ordered\u0026rsquo; interface or by adding the \u0026lsquo;@Order\u0026rsquo; annotation. We define these values.\nIf filters have the same \u0026lsquo;order\u0026rsquo; value, they are executed in the sequence: DefaultFilter \u0026gt; Route Filter \u0026gt; GlobalFilter.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how to specify the order value by implementing an interface:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 //@Order(-1) // Process first @Component public class AuthorizeFilter implements GlobalFilter, Ordered { @Override public Mono\u0026lt;Void\u0026gt; filter(ServerWebExchange exchange, GatewayFilterChain chain) { // Get request parameters MultiValueMap\u0026lt;String, String\u0026gt; params = exchange.getRequest().getQueryParams(); // Get the \u0026#39;AuthorizeFilter\u0026#39; parameter. Here, we assume the first one is the authentication parameter. String authorize = params.getFirst(\u0026#34;AuthorizeFilter\u0026#34;); // Check if(\u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;.equals(authorize)){ // Proceed return chain.filter(exchange); } // Intercept, forbid access exchange.getResponse().setStatusCode(HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN); // Finish processing return exchange.getResponse().setComplete(); } @Override public int getOrder() { return -1; } } Cross-Origin (CORS) Issues Same origin means same protocol, same IP or domain, and same port.\nA cross-origin issue occurs when the browser blocks an AJAX request from the requester to a server if they are from different origins. The solution is CORS.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 spring: cloud: gateway: globalcors: # Global CORS handling add-to-simple-url-handler-mapping: true # Fixes issues with OPTIONS requests being blocked corsConfigurations: \u0026#39;[/**]\u0026#39;: allowedOrigins: # Which origins are allowed to make cross-origin requests - \u0026#34;http://localhost:8090\u0026#34; allowedMethods: # Allowed cross-origin AJAX request methods - \u0026#34;GET\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;POST\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;DELETE\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;PUT\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;OPTIONS\u0026#34; allowedHeaders: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; # Allowed headers to be carried in the request allowCredentials: true # Whether to allow carrying cookies maxAge: 360000 # Validity period for this CORS preflight check ","date":"2024-05-05T00:54:52+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/171/","title":"Gateway Service Gateway"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Feign is a declarative HTTP client.

FULL: Logs everything—headers, body, and metadata for both request and response. There are two ways to configure this: via configuration files or by creating a Bean.\nConfiguration File For a specific service:\n1 2 3 4 5 feign: client: config: userservice: # Target microservice loggerLevel: FULL # Log level Global configuration for all services:\n1 2 3 4 5 feign: client: config: default: # \u0026#39;default\u0026#39; applies globally loggerLevel: FULL # Log level Bean Configuration First, define a configuration class and declare a Logger.Level Bean:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 public class DefaultFeignConfiguration { @Bean public Logger.Level feignLogLevel(){ return Logger.Level.BASIC; // Set level to BASIC } } To apply it globally, add it to the @EnableFeignClients annotation in the startup class:\n1 @EnableFeignClients(defaultConfiguration = DefaultFeignConfiguration .class) To apply it to a specific service, add it to the @FeignClient annotation:\n1 @FeignClient(value = \u0026#34;userService\u0026#34;, configuration = DefaultFeignConfiguration .class) Feign Optimization Feign\u0026rsquo;s underlying HTTP client implementations:\nURLConnection: Default, no connection pooling.

Here is how to switch to HttpClient:\nAdd the dependency: 1 2 3 4 5 \u0026lt;!-- HttpClient dependency --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;io.github.openfeign\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;feign-httpclient\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; Configure the connection pool: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 feign: client: config: default: # Global config loggerLevel: BASIC # Use BASIC for essential request/response info httpclient: enabled: true # Enable HttpClient support max-connections: 200 # Max total connections max-connections-per-route: 50 # Max connections per route Best Practices Best practices are optimized approaches based on common usage patterns.\nThe Feign client code often mirrors the provider\u0026rsquo;s controller:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 // Feign Client @FeignClient(\u0026#34;userService\u0026#34;) public interface UserClient { @GetMapping(\u0026#34;/user/{id}\u0026#34;) User findById(@PathVariable(\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;) Long id); } // Controller @GetMapping(\u0026#34;/user/{id}\u0026#34;) public User queryById(@PathVariable(\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;) Long id) { return userService.queryById(id); } There are two ways to simplify this duplication:\nMethod 1: Inheritance Define a common interface for both the consumer\u0026rsquo;s FeignClient and the provider\u0026rsquo;s Controller.\nDefine the interface:\n1 2 3 4 public interface UserAPI{ @GetMapping(\u0026#34;/user/{id}\u0026#34;) User findById(@PathVariable(\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;) Long id); } Feign Client implementation:\n1 2 @FeignClient(value=\u0026#34;userService\u0026#34;) public interface UserClient extends UserAPI{} Controller implementation:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 @RestController public class UserController implements UserAPI{ public User findById(@PathVariable(\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;) Long id){ // implementation logic } } Pros: Simple and achieves code sharing.\nCons:\nTight coupling between provider and consumer. Annotation mapping in parameter lists doesn\u0026rsquo;t inherit; you must redeclare methods, parameters, and annotations in the Controller. Method 2: Extraction (Modularization) Extract FeignClient into a standalone module. Place the interface, related POJOs, and default Feign configurations in this module for all consumers to use.\nCreate a new project and add the Feign starter dependency:\n1 2 3 4 \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.cloud\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-cloud-starter-openfeign\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; Import this feign-api dependency into the consumer project.\nIf the defined FeignClient is outside the scanning range of the SpringBootApplication, it won\u0026rsquo;t be picked up. Fix this in two ways:\nSpecify the package to scan: 1 @EnableFeignClients(basePackages = \u0026#34;net.yexca.feign.clients\u0026#34;) Specify the specific client classes to load: 1 @EnableFeignClients(clients = {UserClient.class}) ","date":"2024-05-03T23:11:52+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/170/","title":"Feign Remote Calls"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Install the software first.

The default username and password are both nacos.\nTiered Storage Model Services are divided into multiple clusters, each containing multiple instances. Clusters can be assigned by region to improve access speed.\nIn contrast, Eureka only has a Service-Instance model without clusters.\nService calls should prioritize the local cluster to avoid high latency. If the local cluster is unavailable, Nacos will fail over to other clusters.\nYou can set the cluster in application.yml:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 spring: cloud: nacos: server-addr: localhost:8848 discovery: cluster-name: Shanghai # Cluster name Then set the Ribbon strategy to Nacos\u0026rsquo;s strategy:\n1 2 3 4 5 # Configure load balancing rules for a specific microservice, here it\u0026#39;s userService userService: ribbon: NFLoadBalancerRuleClassName: com.alibaba.cloud.nacos.ribbon.NacosRule # NFLoadBalancerRuleClassName: com.netflix.loadbalancer.Nac # Load balancing rule You can also set the instance weight (0-1) in the Nacos console. Higher weight means higher access frequency.\nEnvironment Isolation The outermost layer for service and data storage in Nacos is the namespace, which is used for top-level isolation.\nYou can create a new namespace in Nacos, such as dev, and then update application.yml:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 spring: cloud: nacos: server-addr: localhost:8848 discovery: cluster-name: Shanghai # Cluster name namespace: UUID # The UUID of the namespace Services in different namespaces are invisible to each other and cannot be accessed.\nEphemeral vs. Non-ephemeral Instances For ephemeral instances, Nacos handles them the same way as Eureka (heartbeats).\nFor non-ephemeral instances, Nacos actively probes the service for health. The service is not deleted if it becomes unavailable, and Nacos will actively notify consumers about the failure.\nSet an instance as non-ephemeral:\n1 2 3 4 5 spring: cloud: nacos: discovery: ephemeral: false # Set as non-ephemeral Nacos Configuration Management As the number of microservice instances grows, changing configurations one by one becomes tedious. Nacos allows for centralized configuration management with hot updates.\nBasic Usage In the Nacos console\u0026rsquo;s Configuration Management, create a new configuration.

Uses Zones to categorize servers (e.g., a data center or a rack) and then performs round-robin within the Zone. RoundRobinRule Simple round-robin through the service list. This is the default Ribbon rule. AvailabilityFilteringRule Ignores the following two types of servers: (1) By default, if a connection fails 3 times, the server is set to a \u0026ldquo;short-circuit\u0026rdquo; state for 30 seconds. If it fails again, the duration increases exponentially.(2) Servers with high concurrency. Clients configured with this rule will ignore servers where the active connection count is too high. The upper limit can be configured via \u0026lt;clientName\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;clientConfigNameSpace\u0026gt;.ActiveConnectionsLimit. WeightedResponseTimeRule Assigns a weight to each server. The longer the response time, the lower the weight. Servers are chosen randomly, but the weight influences the selection probability. BestAvailableRule Ignores \u0026ldquo;short-circuited\u0026rdquo; servers and picks the one with the lowest concurrent connection count. RandomRule Randomly picks an available server. RetryRule Selection logic with a retry mechanism. Using the Random Strategy You can modify the load balancing rule by defining an IRule implementation. There are two ways to do this:\nCode Method: Define a new IRule in a configuration class (Global setting). 1 2 3 4 @Bean public IRule randomRule(){ return new RandomRule(); } Configuration File Method: Add configuration to the application.yml of the consumer (e.g., orderServer) to modify the rule for a specific service. 1 2 3 userService: # Configure load balancing for a specific microservice ribbon: NFLoadBalancerRuleClassName: com.netflix.loadbalancer.RandomRule # Load balancing rule Eager Loading Ribbon uses lazy loading by default, meaning it creates the LoadBalanceClient only during the first access.

Set overflow: hidden on the parent. Add border-top to the parent. Element Overflow When content exceeds the box\u0026rsquo;s dimensions, it overflows. The overflow property controls how this overflowing content is displayed.\nProperty Value Effect hidden Content outside the box is clipped/hidden scroll Scrollbars always appear, even if content doesn\u0026rsquo;t overflow auto Scrollbars appear only when content overflows Inline Element Vertical Alignment Adding margin and padding to inline elements (like span) won\u0026rsquo;t change their vertical position. You can adjust this using line-height instead.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 span { margin: 50px; padding: 20px; line-height: 100px; } Rounded Corners Use the border-radius property to give elements rounded borders. The value is the corner\u0026rsquo;s radius, which can be number+px or a percentage. Multiple values work similarly to padding.\nNumber of Values Meaning One All four corners get the same radius Four Top-Left Top-Right Bottom-Right Bottom-Left (clockwise) Three Top-Left Top-Right/Bottom-Left Bottom-Right Two Top-Left/Bottom-Right Top-Right/Bottom-Left Perfect Circles For a square box, set border-radius to half its width/height, or 50%.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 div { width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: aqua; border-radius: 50%; /* Or border-radius: 50px */ } Capsule Shape For a rectangular box, set border-radius to half its height.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 div { width: 100px; height: 50px; background-color: aqua; border-radius: 25px; } Shadow Effects Use box-shadow with the following property values: x-offset y-offset blur-radius spread-radius color inset/outset.\nx and y offsets are required.

Values must be written in order. font-size and font-family are required; others can be omitted.\nText Indent There are two types of values: px or em. em refers to the current tag\u0026rsquo;s font size.\n1 2 3 4 5 p { font-size: 20px; text-indent: 2em; /* First line indent by two characters */ /* text-indent: 40px; /* Same effect as the line above */ } Text Align The text-align property has three values: left, center, right.\n1 2 3 div { text-align: center; /* Centers text */ } This property isn\u0026rsquo;t just for text alignment. For example, you can use it to center an image like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; div { text-align: center; } \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;path\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Essentially, text-align controls content alignment. The property should be set on the content\u0026rsquo;s parent. In the example above, the \u0026lt;img\u0026gt;\u0026rsquo;s parent is the div.\nText Decoration Effect Value None none Underline underline Line-through line-through Overline overline 1 2 3 4 5 6 a { text-decoration: none; /* Removes underline from links */ } del { text-decoration: none; /* Removes the line-through from \u0026lt;del\u0026gt; tags, essentially disabling the \u0026lt;del\u0026gt; tag\u0026#39;s default effect */ } Text Color Color Representation Value Description Keywords English words red, green, aqua, etc. RGB Notation rgb(r, g, b) r, g, b represent red, green, blue primary colors, values 0-255 RGBA Notation rgba(r, g, b, a) a represents transparency (alpha), values 0-1 Hexadecimal Notation #RRGGBB Pairs of two.

Consumers then pull this provider info from Eureka to perform remote calls. Microservices send a heartbeat to Eureka every 30 seconds to confirm they are still alive. Eureka updates its service list accordingly and evicts unhealthy instances.\nIf multiple service providers are available, the consumer uses a load-balancing algorithm to pick one from the list.\nSetup Create a new Maven Module and add the dependency:\n1 2 3 4 \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.cloud\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; Create the startup class:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 @EnableEurekaServer @SpringBootApplication public class EurekaApplication { public static void main(String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(EurekaApplication.class,args); } } Configuration file:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 server: port: 7995 spring: application: name: eureka-server eureka: client: service-url: defaultZone: http://127.0.0.1:7995/eureka Service Registration Add the dependency:\n1 2 3 4 \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.cloud\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; Add configuration:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 spring: application: name: userService eureka: client: service-url: defaultZone: http://127.0.0.1:7995/eureka Usage Register the bean:\n1 2 3 4 5 @Bean @LoadBalanced public RestTemplate restTemplate(){ return new RestTemplate(); } Change the target URL from a hardcoded hostname to the service name:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 @Service public class OrderService { @Autowired private OrderMapper orderMapper; @Autowired private RestTemplate restTemplate; public Order queryOrderById(Long orderId) { // 1.

Appending may increase the slice\u0026rsquo;s capacity.\nYou can define a slice by declaring an array without specifying its size:\n1 2 3 var name []type // Example var s []int Or use the make() function to create a slice:\n1 2 3 var slice []type = make([]type, len) // len is the initial length // Or the shorthand slice := make([]type, len) You can use the optional capacity parameter to specify capacity. If omitted, it defaults to the length.\n1 var slice []type = make([]type, length, capacity) Slice Initialization Direct initialization:\n1 s := []int {1, 2, 3} Initialize a slice from an array, from startIndex to endIndex-1. Both values are optional.\n1 s := arr[startIndex:endIndex] Omitting startIndex defaults to the first element; omitting endIndex goes to the last element.\nlen() and cap() Slices are indexable. Use len() to get the current length.\ncap() calculates the capacity, measuring the maximum size the slice can reach.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 package main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; // Slices are passed by reference; modifications inside affect original data func printSlice(slice []int) { fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;len=%d, cap=%d, slice=%v\u0026#34;, len(slice), cap(slice), slice) } func main() { s := make([]int, 3, 5) printSlice(s) } /* * Output: * len=3, cap=5, slice=[0 0 0] */ Nil Slices An uninitialized slice defaults to nil (nil slice) with a length of 0.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 package main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func printSlice(slice []int) { fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;len=%d, cap=%d, slice=%v\\n\u0026#34;, len(slice), cap(slice), slice) } func main() { var s []int printSlice(s) // Check if nil if s == nil { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;slice is empty\u0026#34;) } } Slice Slicing Slice a slice by setting lower and upper bounds.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 package main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func printSlice(slice []int) { fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;len=%d, cap=%d, slice=%v\\n\u0026#34;, len(slice), cap(slice), slice) } func main() { s := []int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} // Print original slice fmt.Println(s) // From index 2 (inclusive) to 5 (exclusive) printSlice(s[2:5]) // From start to 5 (exclusive) printSlice(s[:5]) // From index 2 to end printSlice(s[2:]) // This assignment means modifying subS will affect s subS := s[1:6] printSlice(subS) } append() and copy() Increasing slice capacity and copying slices.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 package main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func printSlice(slice []int) { fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;len=%d, cap=%d, slice=%v\\n\u0026#34;, len(slice), cap(slice), slice) } func main() { var s []int printSlice(s) // Add one element s = append(s, 0) printSlice(s) // Add multiple elements s = append(s, 1, 2, 3, 4) printSlice(s) // Create s2 with twice the capacity of s s2 := make([]int, len(s), cap(s)*2) // Copy s to s2.

The writing style is different from my current one, and it feels a bit strange to read.\nUsing the crontab command, we can execute specified system commands or shell scripts at fixed intervals. The interval units can be any combination of minutes, hours, days, months, and weeks.\nCommand Format 1 crontab [-u user] file crontab [-u user] [ -e | -l | -r ] Command Parameters -u user: Used to set the crontab service for a specific user. file: The name of the command file. This loads the file as the crontab task list. If no file is specified, crontab accepts input from stdin (keyboard). -e: Edit the crontab file for a user. Defaults to the current user. -l: Display the contents of the crontab file. Defaults to the current user. -r: Remove a user\u0026rsquo;s crontab file from the /var/spool/cron directory. Defaults to the current user. -i: Prompt for confirmation before deleting the crontab file. File Format Executing crontab -e opens the current user\u0026rsquo;s crontab file. In this file, lines starting with # are comments.\nTasks are set using six fields: m h dom mon dow command. Each line represents one task. The fields are defined as follows:\nm: Minute (0-59) Specifies which minute of the hour to run the task.\nh: Hour (0-23) Specifies which hour of the day to run the task.\ndom: Day of Month (1-31) Specifies which day of the month to run the task.\nmon: Month (1-12) Specifies which month of the year to run the task. You can also use the first three letters of the month (case-insensitive), e.g., jan for January.\ndow: Day of Week (0-7) Specifies which day of the week to run the task. Both 0 and 7 represent Sunday. You can also use the first three letters of the day (case-insensitive), e.g., mon for Monday.\ncommand: The operation to execute The specific command or script path to run.\nFields must be separated by spaces. Every field requires a value. Everything after the fifth field is considered part of the command field.\nThe first five fields can use special characters:\nAsterisk (*): Represents all possible values. For example, a * in the month field means the command runs every month. Comma (,): Specifies a list of values, e.g., 1,2,5,7,8,9. Hyphen (-): Specifies a range of values, e.g., 2-6 means 2,3,4,5,6. Slash (/): Specifies frequency/intervals. For example, 0-23/2 in the hour field means every two hours. */10 in the minute field means every ten minutes. In the command field, you can use newline characters or the % character to separate command content.\nContent before the first % is passed to the shell. The % itself is replaced by a newline, and all content after it is passed as standard input.\nTo use a literal % character, escape it with a backslash: \\%.\nCommon Usage Before submitting a crontab file, set the EDITOR environment variable. The cron process uses this to determine which editor to open.\nThe default nano editor can be clunky for some. To use vi, edit your .profile in the $HOME directory and add:\n1 EDITOR=vi; export EDITOR Save and exit. You can create a file named \u0026lt;user\u0026gt;cron (e.g., yexcacron) and add your tasks:\n1 2 # echo the date to the console every 15 minutes between 6pm and 6am 0,15,30,45 18-06 * * * /bin/echo \u0026#39;date\u0026#39; \u0026gt; /dev/console In this example, the system outputs the current time to the console every 15 minutes. If the system hangs, you can tell when it stopped by looking at the last timestamp. (Note: some systems use tty1 for the console). To submit this file to cron, use it as an argument:\n1 crontab yexcacron The file is now submitted and will run every 15 minutes. A copy is stored in /var/spool/cron named after your username (e.g., yexca).\nExecuting Scripts If your script requires environment variables:\n1 30 6 * * * . /etc/profile;/bin/sh /root/zfile/bin/restart.sh The above runs the zfile restart.sh script every day at 6:30 AM.\nReferences crontab 定时任务 — Linux Tools Quick Tutorial Linux技巧：介绍设置定时周期执行任务的方法 - SegmentFault Linux命令之Crontab——定时任务 - SegmentFault nano编辑器使用教程 - VPS侦探 Linux vi/vim - 菜鸟教程 ","date":"2024-02-26T21:34:15+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/159/","title":"Linux Scheduled Tasks: crontab"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Service Architecture Monolithic Architecture All business functions are integrated into a single project, packaged as one unit for deployment.\nPros: Simple architecture, low deployment cost. Good for small projects.\nCons: High coupling. Poor scalability.\nDistributed Architecture Split the system based on business functions. Each module is developed as an independent project, called a \u0026ldquo;service.\u0026rdquo;\nPros: Reduced coupling, easier to upgrade and scale.\nCons: Complex architecture, high difficulty. Suitable for large-scale internet projects.\nMicroservices Microservices is a well-designed distributed architecture pattern. Key characteristics:\nSingle Responsibility : Fine-grained service splitting. Each service corresponds to a unique business capability to avoid redundant development. Service-Oriented: Services expose business interfaces to the outside. Autonomous: Independent teams, tech stacks, data, and deployment. Strong Isolation: Implement isolation, fault tolerance, and fallbacks for service calls to prevent cascading failures. Microservice Technologies Implementing a microservice solution requires a technical framework. Common ones include:\nDubbo SpringCloud SpringCloudAlibaba Service Registry zookeeper, Redis Eureka, Consul Nacos, Eureka Remote Call Dubbo protocol Feign (HTTP protocol) Dubbo, Feign Config Center None SpringCloudConfig SpringCloudConfig, Nacos API Gateway None SpringCloudGateway, Zuul SpringCloudGateway, Zuul Monitoring/Protection dubbo-admin (limited) Hystix Sentinel Microservices should be split according to business modules:\nSingle Responsibility: Don\u0026rsquo;t duplicate the same business logic in different services. Data Independence: Do not directly access other services\u0026rsquo; databases. Service-Oriented: Expose your business logic as interfaces for other services to call. SpringCloud SpringCloud is currently the most widely used microservice framework.

It is an open-source high-performance key-value database developed in C. It supports rich value types and is often referred to as a structured NoSQL (Not Only SQL) database.\nNoSQL refers to non-relational databases. It\u0026rsquo;s not meant to replace relational databases but to complement them.\nRelational Databases (RDBMS):\nMySQL Oracle DB2 SQLServer Non-relational Databases (NoSQL):\nRedis MongoDB MemCached Redis Download, Installation, and Execution Download links:\nWindows: https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases Linux: https://download.redis.io/releases/ CN: http://www.redis.cn/download.html For Windows, just unzip it. For Linux:\nUnzip: tar -zxvf redis-4.0.0.tar.gz -C /usr/local Install dependencies: yum install gcc-c++ Enter the directory and compile: make Enter the src directory and install: make install File Descriptions:\n/usr/local/redis-4.0.0/src/redis-server: Redis server startup script /usr/local/redis-4.0.0/src/redis-cli: Redis client script /usr/local/redis-4.0.0/redis.conf: Redis configuration file To start the server (Windows example):\n1 redis-server.exe redis.windows.conf The default port is 6379 with no password. Once started, you can connect via a client.\nCommand Line Connection Connect using redis-cli.exe:\n1 redis-cli.exe -h ip -p port -a password If omitted, it defaults to 127.0.0.1:6379.\nYou can set a password by modifying the configuration file (redis.windows.conf):\n1 requirepass 123456 Restart the server for changes to take effect.\nGUI Connection Github: https://github.com/qishibo/AnotherRedisDesktopManager Download, install, create a new connection, and enter your details.\nDocker Deployment Pull the image:\n1 docker pull redis Get the configuration file for your version (e.g., redis.conf).\nCreate data mapping directories:\n1 2 mkdir /home/redis mkdir /home/redis/data Modify the config file and transfer it to the server (e.g., using scp from Win to Linux):\n1 scp pathOfFile root@IP:/PathOfFile Run:\n1 docker run -p 6379:6379 --name redis -v /home/redis/redis.conf:/etc/redis/redis.conf -v /home/redis/data:/data -d redis redis-server /etc/redis/redis.conf Reference: https://cloud.tencent.com/developer/article/1670205 Redis Data Types Redis keys are always strings. Values support 5 common data types:\nString: Standard text or binary data. Hash: A map of fields and values. List: Ordered collection of strings (allows duplicates). Set: Unordered collection of unique strings. Sorted Set (zset): Unique strings associated with a score, ordered by score. Common Redis Commands Redis commands are case-insensitive.\nCommon String commands:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 # Set value for a key SET key value # Get value of a key GET key # Set value with expiration in seconds SETEX key seconds value # Set value only if key does not exist SETNX key value Hash commands (ideal for storing objects):\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # Set field in a hash HSET key field value # Get value of a field HGET key field # Delete a field HDEL key field # Get all fields HKEYS key # Get all values HVALS key List commands (insertion order):\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # Insert at head LPUSH key value1 [value2] # Get range of elements LRANGE key start stop # Remove and get last element RPOP key # Get list length LLEN key # Block until element is available to pop from tail BRPOP key1 [key2] timeout Lists behave like queues (FIFO).\nSet commands (unique, unordered):\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 # Add members SADD key member1 [member2] # Get all members SMEMBERS key # Get member count SCARD key # Intersection of sets SINTER key2 [key2] # Union of sets SUNION key1 [key2] # Remove members SREM key member1 [member2] Sorted Set commands (members + double score):\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 # Add members with scores ZADD key score1 member1 [score2 member2] # Get range of members by index ZRANGE key start stop [WITHSCORES] # Increment score of a member ZINCRBY key increment member # Remove members ZREM key member1 [member2] Generic commands (apply to all types):\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 # Find keys matching a pattern (e.g., KEYS *) KEYS pattern # Check if key exists EXISTS key # Get data type of key TYPE key # Delete a key DEL key Operating Redis in Java To work with Redis in Java, you need a client library, similar to how you use JDBC for MySQL.\nPopular Java clients:\nJedis Lettuce Spring Data Redis Jedis has a clean API identical to Redis commands and is officially recommended. Lettuce handles threading better and offers higher performance. Spring Data Redis integrates these into the Spring ecosystem, providing a convenient Starter (spring-boot-starter-data-redis).\nSpring Data Redis Part of the Spring Data project, it simplifies Redis operations through configuration and high-level abstractions.\nMaven Dependency:\n1 2 3 4 \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt;

func swap(a, b int) (x int, y int) { x = b y = a return } func main() { var x, y = swap(10, 20) fmt.Println(x, y) } If the return types are the same, they can be merged:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 package main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func swap(a, b int) (x, y int) { x = b y = a // x and y default to 0 if not assigned return } func main() { var x, y = swap(10, 20) fmt.Println(x, y) } init and main The init function can exist in any package and appear multiple times in the same package, though one is recommended.\nThe main function must be in package main, and that package must contain the function.\nBoth are reserved functions; they take no arguments and return no values.\nGo automatically calls init() and main().\nProgram Execution Program initialization and execution start from the main package. Even if a package is imported by multiple packages, it is only imported once. Here is the execution order:\nExample:\nAssume the following structure:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 hello -- InitLib1 -- lib1.go -- InitLib2 -- lib2.go main.go Contents:\nlib1.go\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 package InitLib1 import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func init() { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;lib1 init\u0026#34;) } lib2.go\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 package InitLib2 import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func init() { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;lib2 init\u0026#34;) } main.go\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; // Using an underscore as an alias allows anonymous importing; // without it, importing without usage fails compilation. _ \u0026#34;hello/InitLib1\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;hello/InitLib2\u0026#34; ) func init() { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;main init\u0026#34;) } func main() { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;main\u0026#34;) } Execution result:\n1 2 3 4 lib1 init lib2 init main init main Now, import Lib2 into Lib1, keeping the main code the same:\nlib1.go\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 package InitLib1 import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;hello/InitLib2\u0026#34; ) func init() { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;lib1 init\u0026#34;) } Running main results in:\n1 2 3 4 lib2 init lib1 init main init main Notice lib2 only initializes once.\nCalling Functions from Other Packages In the previous example, _ was used as an anonymous alias, meaning you couldn\u0026rsquo;t call methods from that package.\nAdd a function to lib1:\nlib1.go\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 package InitLib1 import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; //_ \u0026#34;hello/InitLib2\u0026#34; ) // Functions must start with a capital letter to be exported. func Lib1Test() { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;lib1 test\u0026#34;) } func init() { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;lib1 init\u0026#34;) } main.go\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; // Alias the package mylib1 \u0026#34;hello/InitLib1\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;hello/InitLib2\u0026#34; ) func main() { // Call via alias.Method mylib1.Lib1Test() fmt.Println(\u0026#34;main\u0026#34;) } /* * Output * lib1 init * lib2 init * lib1 test * main */ Alternatively, you can use ., in main.go:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; // Change alias to . . \u0026#34;hello/InitLib1\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;hello/InitLib2\u0026#34; ) func main() { // Use directly Lib1Test() fmt.Println(\u0026#34;main\u0026#34;) } Not recommended; it creates ambiguity if two packages have functions with the same name.\nPointers Similar to C pointers.\nParameters can be passed by value or by pointer (reference). By default, Go uses pass-by-value (as seen in the first section of this post).\nUse \u0026amp; to get a variable\u0026rsquo;s memory address.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; ) func main() { var a int fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;%x\u0026#34;, \u0026amp;a) } Passing by reference sends the memory address to the function; modifications affect the original variable.

You can place any number of \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; tags anywhere in the HTML document. Usually, scripts are placed at the bottom of the \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; element to improve page load speed. 1 2 3 \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; alert(\u0026#34;Hello JavaScript\u0026#34;) \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; External Scripts Define JS code in an external .js file, then import it into the HTML page.\nExternal JS files contain only JS code, without \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; tags. 1 2 3 4 5 \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;./js/1.js\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; JS file content:\n1 alert(\u0026#34;Hello JavaScript\u0026#34;) JS Basic Syntax JS is case-sensitive. Semicolons at the end of lines are optional. There are two types of comments:\n1 2 3 4 5 // Single-line comment /* Multi-line comment */ Curly braces denote code blocks.\n1 2 3 4 // Conditional statement if(count==3){ alert(count); } Output Statements You can output data to alert boxes, the HTML page, or the console.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 // Browser alert box window.alert(\u0026#34;Hello from alert\u0026#34;) // Write directly to HTML document.write(\u0026#34;Hello from HTML\u0026#34;) // Log to browser console console.log(\u0026#34;Hello from console\u0026#34;) Variables JS is a weakly typed language. Variables can hold values of different types. Variable names should follow these rules:\nCharacters can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs. Cannot start with a digit. CamelCase is recommended. There are three keywords for defining variables: var, let, and const.\nvar Short for \u0026ldquo;variable\u0026rdquo;.

This made it hard to reuse and maintain. To fix this and follow the Single Responsibility Principle, we need to separate them. Three-tier architecture makes code more reusable, easier to maintain, and more extensible.\nThe three layers are Controller, Service, and Dao.\nController: The control layer. It receives requests from the frontend, processes them, and responds with data. Service: The business logic layer. It handles specific business logic. Dao: The Data Access Object (or persistence layer). It handles data access operations like CRUD. Browser sends request -\u0026gt; Controller receives request, responds with data -\u0026gt; Service processes logic -\u0026gt; Dao accesses data.\nThe emp example code can be optimized as follows:\nController 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 @RestController public class EmpController { @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/listEmp\u0026#34;) public Result listEmp(){ EmpService empServiceA = new EmpServiceA(); List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; empList = empServiceA.listEmp(); return Result.success(empList); } } Service 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 // interface public interface EmpService { public List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; listEmp(); } public class EmpServiceA implements EmpService { private EmpDao empDao = new EmpDaoA(); public List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; listEmp(){ List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; empList = empDao.listEmp(); empList.forEach(emp -\u0026gt; { String gender = emp.getGender(); if(\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;.equals(gender)){ emp.setGender(\u0026#34;男\u0026#34;); } else if (\u0026#34;2\u0026#34;.equals(gender)) { emp.setGender(\u0026#34;女\u0026#34;); } String job = emp.getJob(); if(\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;.equals(job)){ emp.setJob(\u0026#34;讲师\u0026#34;); } else if (\u0026#34;2\u0026#34;.equals(job)) { emp.setJob(\u0026#34;班主任\u0026#34;); } else if (\u0026#34;3\u0026#34;.equals(job)) { emp.setJob(\u0026#34;就业指导\u0026#34;); } }); return empList; } } Dao 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 // interface public interface EmpDao { public List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; listEmp(); } public class EmpDaoA implements EmpDao { public List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; listEmp(){ String file = this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResource(\u0026#34;emp.xml\u0026#34;).getFile(); List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; empList = XmlParserUtils.parse(file, Emp.class); return empList; } } Layered Decoupling Cohesion: The degree of functional relatedness within the elements of a single software module.\nCoupling: Measures the degree of dependence or association between different layers/modules in software.\nSoftware design principle: High cohesion, low coupling.\nFor more details, see https://blog.yexca.net/archives/145 For instance, in the three-tier architecture example above, the Controller is coupled with the Service, and the Service is coupled with the Dao.\nIn the Controller, directly creating a Service object like EmpService empServiceA = new EmpServiceA(); means using A. If you switch to B, you\u0026rsquo;d need to change the Controller. To change the Service without modifying the Controller, you can create a container. This allows the Controller to get objects from the container (Dependency Injection), and the Service injects its services into the container (Inversion of Control).\nInversion of Control (IoC): The control over object creation shifts from the program itself to an external entity (the container). Dependency Injection (DI): The container provides the application with the resources it needs at runtime. Bean Object: An object created and managed by the IoC container. IoC To let the IoC container manage an object, you need to add one of the following annotations to its class:\nAnnotation Description Location @Component Basic annotation to declare a bean Use this when it doesn\u0026rsquo;t fall into the other three categories (e.g., utility classes) @Controller A derived annotation of @Component Annotate on controller classes @Service A derived annotation of @Component Annotate on business classes @Repository A derived annotation of @Component Annotate on data access classes (less common with MyBatis integration) When declaring a bean, you can specify its name using the value attribute. If not specified, the default is the class name with the first letter lowercase. In SpringBoot web development, you can only declare controller beans using @Controller. Bean Component Scanning For the four bean declaration annotations above to work, they also need to be scanned by the @ComponentScan annotation.\nThis annotation is actually included in the @SpringBootApplication annotation used on the startup class. The default scan scope is the package of the startup class and its sub-packages.\nYou can specify the scan scope via the value or basePackage attribute.\n1 @ComponentScan({\u0026#34;dao\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;net.yexca\u0026#34;}) Example In the example above:\nController Since @RestController already includes @Controller, no changes are needed.\nService 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 // interface public interface EmpService { public List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; listEmp(); } // Add to the implementation class @Service // Hands this class over to the IoC container for management, making it an IoC container Bean. public class EmpServiceA implements EmpService { private EmpDao empDao = new EmpDaoA(); public List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; listEmp(){ List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; empList = empDao.listEmp(); empList.forEach(emp -\u0026gt; { String gender = emp.getGender(); if(\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;.equals(gender)){ emp.setGender(\u0026#34;男\u0026#34;); } else if (\u0026#34;2\u0026#34;.equals(gender)) { emp.setGender(\u0026#34;女\u0026#34;); } String job = emp.getJob(); if(\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;.equals(job)){ emp.setJob(\u0026#34;讲师\u0026#34;); } else if (\u0026#34;2\u0026#34;.equals(job)) { emp.setJob(\u0026#34;班主任\u0026#34;); } else if (\u0026#34;3\u0026#34;.equals(job)) { emp.setJob(\u0026#34;就业指导\u0026#34;); } }); return empList; } } Dao 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 // interface public interface EmpDao { public List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; listEmp(); } // Add to the implementation class @Repository // Hands this class over to the IoC container for management, making it an IoC container Bean. public class EmpDaoA implements EmpDao { public List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; listEmp(){ String file = this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResource(\u0026#34;emp.xml\u0026#34;).getFile(); List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; empList = XmlParserUtils.parse(file, Emp.class); return empList; } } DI You can inject dependencies using the @Autowired annotation.

Each module can be independently developed and tested, then assembled into a complete program. This is a \u0026ldquo;divide and conquer\u0026rdquo; principle for complex problems. The goal of modularity is to make the program structure clear, easy to read, understand, test, and modify.\nModule Independence Module independence means each module performs a relatively independent, specific sub-function, with simple connections to other modules. There are two standards for measuring module independence: coupling and cohesion.\nCoupling Coupling measures the relative independence (or tightness of connection) between modules. It depends on the complexity of interfaces, how modules are called, and the type of information passed through interfaces. Generally, there are 7 types of coupling between modules:\nNo direct coupling. Means two modules have no direct relationship, belonging to different control and call hierarchies, and passing no information between them. Data coupling. Two modules have a call relationship, passing simple data values, similar to pass-by-value in high-level languages. Stamp coupling. Two modules pass data structures between them. Control coupling. One module calls another, passing a control variable. The called module selectively executes a specific function based on the value of this control variable. External coupling. Modules are linked via the environment outside the software (e.g., I/O coupling a module to specific devices, formats, communication protocols). Common coupling. Coupling between modules interacting through a shared global data environment. Content coupling. When one module directly uses another module\u0026rsquo;s internal data, or jumps into another module\u0026rsquo;s internal code via a non-standard entry point. Cohesion Cohesion measures how tightly bound the elements within a module are to each other. A highly cohesive module (ideally) should do one thing only. Generally, module cohesion is divided into 7 types:\nCoincidental cohesion. Elements within the module have no meaningful relationship. Logical cohesion. The module performs several logically similar functions, with a parameter determining which function to execute. Temporal cohesion. Actions that need to be performed at the same time are grouped into a module. Procedural cohesion. A module performs multiple tasks that must be executed in a specified sequence. Communicational cohesion. All elements within the module operate on the same data structure, or use the same input data, or produce the same output data. Sequential cohesion. Elements within a module are closely related to the same function and must execute in sequence, where the output of one element becomes the input for the next. Functional cohesion. This is the strongest type of cohesion, where all elements within the module work together to achieve a single function, and none can be missing. Coupling and cohesion are two qualitative standards for module independence. When decomposing a software system into modules, aim for high cohesion and low coupling to enhance module independence.\nSystem Architecture Design Principles To ensure a successful overall architectural design, these principles should be followed:\nDecomposition-Coordination Principle. The entire system is a whole, with overall goals and functions. However, these goals and functions are realized through the collaborative work of interconnected components. A crucial principle for solving complex problems is to break them down into smaller sub-problems, handling each separately, while coordinating relationships between parts according to overall system requirements. Top-Down Principle. First grasp the system\u0026rsquo;s overall functional objectives, then decompose layer by layer, meaning define the functions of higher-level modules before lower-level modules. Information Hiding and Abstraction Principle. Higher-level modules only specify what lower-level modules should do and how they coordinate, but not how they do it. This ensures relative independence and internal structural rationality for each module, leading to clear module hierarchies, and ease of understanding, implementation, and maintenance. Consistency Principle. Ensure uniform specifications, standards, and document patterns throughout the entire software design process. Clarity Principle. Each module must have clear functions and correct interfaces, eliminating multi-functional and superfluous interfaces. Minimize coupling between modules, maximize module cohesion. Module fan-in and fan-out should be reasonable. The number of modules directly called by a module is its fan-out; conversely, the number of modules that directly call a given module is its fan-in. Both fan-in and fan-out should be appropriate. Experience shows that a well-designed system typically has an average fan-in/fan-out of 3 or 4, generally not exceeding 7, as higher values can increase error probability. However, menu-driven modules can have larger fan-in/fan-out, and utility modules can have a larger fan-in. Appropriate module size. Overly large modules often indicate insufficient system decomposition, potentially containing functions from several parts. Therefore, it\u0026rsquo;s necessary to further decompose such modules into smaller, as-single-function-as-possible modules. However, decomposition must also be moderate, as excessively small modules can reduce module independence and increase system interface complexity. A module\u0026rsquo;s scope of effect should be within its scope of control. System Documentation Information system documentation serves as the \u0026ldquo;trail\u0026rdquo; of the system development process, a guide for maintenance personnel, and a communication tool between developers and users. Well-standardized documentation implies that the system was developed using an engineering approach, formally assuring its quality. Missing, informal, or non-standardized documentation can very likely lead to an unmaintainable, unupgradable, unscalable, and lifeless system once the original developers move on.\nThe various roles of documentation among system developers, project managers, system maintenance personnel, system evaluators, and users are summarized below:\nUsers and system analysts communicate through documents during the system planning and analysis phases. These documents primarily include feasibility study reports, overall planning reports, system development contracts, and system design specifications. System developers and project managers communicate through documents throughout the project lifecycle. These documents mainly include the system development plan (such as WBS, PERT charts, Gantt charts, and budget allocation tables), monthly development reports, and system development summary reports, among other project management files. System testers and system developers communicate through documents. System testers can evaluate the system developed by system developers based on documents like system design specifications, system development contracts, system design documents, and test plans. Testers then compile their evaluation results into a system test report. System developers and users communicate during system operation. Users operate the system using documents written by system developers. These documents are primarily user manuals and operation guides. System developers and system maintenance personnel communicate through documents. These documents mainly include system design specifications and system development summary reports. Users and maintenance personnel communicate during operation and maintenance. While using the information system, users document issues encountered during operation, forming system operation reports and maintenance/modification suggestions. System maintenance personnel then maintain and upgrade the system based on these suggestions and technical manuals left by the system developers.

After processing, the result is returned to the DispatcherServlet, and then sent back to the browser.\nThe DispatcherServlet is known as the core controller or front controller.\nBrowser request data is encapsulated into an HttpServletRequest object, and response data into an HttpServletResponse object.\n*Controllers receive requests and set responses.\nRequest Simple Parameters First, the traditional way: get request parameters manually via the HttpServletRequest object.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/simpleParam\u0026#34;) public String simpleParam(HttpServletRequest request){ String name = request.getParameter(\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;); String ageStr = request.getParameter(\u0026#34;age\u0026#34;); int age = Integer.parseInt(ageStr); System.out.println(name + \u0026#34;;\u0026#34; + age); return \u0026#34;OK\u0026#34;; } When you visit http://localhost:8080/simpleParam?name=tom\u0026age=18 in your browser, the page returns \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;, and the program outputs \u0026ldquo;Tom;18\u0026rdquo;.\nClearly, this method is too cumbersome. In Spring Boot, you can simply define method parameters with the same names as the request parameters to receive them.\n1 2 3 4 5 @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/simpleParam\u0026#34;) public String simpleParam(String name, Integer age){ System.out.println(name + \u0026#34;;\u0026#34; + age); return \u0026#34;OK\u0026#34;; } Same effect as above.\nHowever, the above method will still run even if the request parameter names differ; missing parameters will be null.\nYou can use @RequestParam to map request parameter names to different method parameter names.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/simpleParam\u0026#34;) public String simpleParam(@RequestParam(name = \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;) String username, Integer age){ // When @RequestParam is declared, it means the parameter *must* be passed, otherwise an error occurs. // If changed to @RequestParam(name = \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;, required = false), the parameter is optional. System.out.println(username + \u0026#34;;\u0026#34; + age); return \u0026#34;OK\u0026#34;; } Object Parameters For a few parameters, the above methods work. But for more data, you can use a simple object (POJO). If request parameter names match the POJO\u0026rsquo;s property names, just define a POJO to receive them.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/simplePojo\u0026#34;) public String simplePojo(User user){ System.out.println(user); return \u0026#34;OK\u0026#34;; } // User class public class User{ private String name; private Integer age; // getters, setters, toString method } Visiting http://localhost:8080/simplePojo?name=tom\u0026age=18 returns \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;, and the program outputs \u0026ldquo;User{name=\u0026lsquo;tom\u0026rsquo;, age=18}\u0026rdquo;.\nComplex object parameters: If request parameter names match the method parameter\u0026rsquo;s object property names, nested POJO properties can be received by following the object hierarchy.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/complexPojo\u0026#34;) public String complexPojo(UserComplex user){ System.out.println(user); return \u0026#34;OK\u0026#34;; } // User class public class UserComplex{ private String name; private Integer age; private Address address; // getters, setters, toString } // Address class public class Address{ private String province; private String city; // getters, setters, toString } Visiting http://localhost:8080/complexPojo?name=tom\u0026age=18\u0026address.province=beijing\u0026address.city=beijing returns \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;, and the program outputs \u0026ldquo;UserComplex{name=\u0026lsquo;tom\u0026rsquo;, age=1000, address=Address{province=\u0026lsquo;ads,beijing\u0026rsquo;, city=\u0026lsquo;asda,beijing\u0026rsquo;}}\u0026rdquo;.\nArray Parameters If the request parameter name matches the method\u0026rsquo;s array parameter name, and there are multiple values, you can define an array-type method parameter to accept them. For example, for checkboxes.\n1 2 3 4 5 @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/arrayParam\u0026#34;) public String arrayParam(String[] hobby){ System.out.println(Arrays.toString(hobby)); return \u0026#34;OK\u0026#34;; } Visiting http://localhost:8080/arrayParam?hobby=ads\u0026hobby=58s returns \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;, and the program outputs \u0026ldquo;[ads, 58s]\u0026rdquo;.\nCollection Parameters If the request parameter name matches the method\u0026rsquo;s collection parameter name, and there are multiple values, use @RequestParam to bind the parameters.\n1 2 3 4 5 @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/listParam\u0026#34;) public String listParam(@RequestParam List\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; hobby){ System.out.println(hobby); return \u0026#34;OK\u0026#34;; } Visiting http://localhost:8080/listParam?hobby=ads\u0026hobby=58s returns \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;, and the program outputs \u0026ldquo;[ads, 58s]\u0026rdquo;.\nDate Parameters Use the @DateTimeFormat annotation to convert date parameter formats.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s worth noting there are three common parameter formats:\nyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss yyyy年MM月dd日 HH时mm分ss秒 (yyyy年MM月dd日 HH时mm分ss秒) Frontend and backend need to agree on the format.\n1 2 3 4 5 @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/dateParam\u0026#34;) public String dateParam(@DateTimeFormat(pattern = \u0026#34;yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\u0026#34;) LocalDateTime localDateTime){ System.out.println(localDateTime); return \u0026#34;OK\u0026#34;; } Visiting http://localhost:8080/dateParam?localDateTime=2024-01-01%2001:01:01 returns \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;, and the program outputs \u0026ldquo;2024-01-01T01:01:01\u0026rdquo;.\nJSON Parameters If JSON data keys match the method parameter\u0026rsquo;s object property names, you can define a POJO-type method parameter to receive them. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to use @RequestBody.\nTo send JSON data, you must use a POST request.\n1 2 3 4 5 @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/jsonParam\u0026#34;) public String jsonParam(@RequestBody UserComplex userComplex){ System.out.println(userComplex); return \u0026#34;OK\u0026#34;; } Request data:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;jane\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;18\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;address\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;province\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;上海\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;city\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;上海\u0026#34; } } Using POST to request http://localhost:8080/jsonParam with the data above, the page returns \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;, and the program outputs \u0026ldquo;UserComplex{name=\u0026lsquo;jane\u0026rsquo;, age=18, address=Address{province=\u0026lsquo;上海\u0026rsquo;, city=\u0026lsquo;上海\u0026rsquo;}}\u0026rdquo;.\nPath Parameters Pass parameters directly in the request URL. Use {...} to mark path parameters, and @PathVariable to retrieve them.\n1 2 3 4 5 @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/path/{id}\u0026#34;) public String pathParam(@PathVariable Integer id){ System.out.println(id); return \u0026#34;OK\u0026#34;; } Visiting http://localhost:8080/path/52 returns \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;, and the program outputs \u0026ldquo;52\u0026rdquo;.\nVisiting http://localhost:8080/path/255 returns \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;, and the program outputs \u0026ldquo;255\u0026rdquo;.\nFor multiple path parameters:\n1 2 3 4 5 @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/path/{id}/{name}\u0026#34;) public String pathParam(@PathVariable Integer id, @PathVariable String name){ System.out.println(id + \u0026#34;;\u0026#34; + name); return \u0026#34;OK\u0026#34;; } Visiting http://localhost:8080/path/255/Tom returns \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;, and the program outputs \u0026ldquo;255;Tom\u0026rdquo;.\nSummary Simple Parameters Define method parameters; request parameter names should match variable names. If they don\u0026rsquo;t match, map them manually with @RequestParam. Object Parameters Request parameter names should match object property names for automatic encapsulation. Array \u0026amp; Collection Parameters Arrays: Request parameter name matches array name for direct encapsulation. Collections: Request parameter name matches collection name; bind with @RequestParam. Date Parameters @DateTimeFormat JSON Parameters @RequestBody Path Parameters @PathVariable Response Use @ResponseBody to handle responses.\nThe above request methods could send responses because the @RestController annotation includes both @Controller and @ResponseBody.\n@ResponseBody Type: Method annotation, Class annotation\nLocation: On a Controller method or class\nPurpose: Returns the method\u0026rsquo;s return value directly as the response. If the return type is an object or collection, it will be converted to JSON format.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 @RestController public class ResponseController { @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/hello\u0026#34;) public String hello(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;Hello SpringBoot\u0026#34;); return \u0026#34;Hello SpringBoot\u0026#34;; } @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/getAddr\u0026#34;) public Address getAddr(){ Address address = new Address(); address.setProvince(\u0026#34;上海\u0026#34;); address.setCity(\u0026#34;上海\u0026#34;); return address; } @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/listAddr\u0026#34;) public List\u0026lt;Address\u0026gt; listAddr(){ List\u0026lt;Address\u0026gt; list = new ArrayList\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); Address address1 = new Address(); address1.setProvince(\u0026#34;北京\u0026#34;); address1.setCity(\u0026#34;北京\u0026#34;); Address address2 = new Address(); address2.setProvince(\u0026#34;上海\u0026#34;); address2.setCity(\u0026#34;上海\u0026#34;); list.add(address1); list.add(address2); return list; } } Visit the respective URLs to test.\nUnified Response Result The return types of the three methods above are all different, which makes frontend development harder. To address this, you can unify the response results into a single class.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 public class Result{ // Response code: 1 for success, 0 for failure. private Integer code; // Message private String msg; // Returned data private Object data; // ... } Making all response methods return a Result object makes project management and maintenance easier.\nFor example, this class:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 public class Result { private Integer code ;// 1 for success, 0 for failure private String msg; // Message private Object data; // Data payload public Result() { } public Result(Integer code, String msg, Object data) { this.code = code; this.msg = msg; this.data = data; } public Integer getCode() { return code; } public void setCode(Integer code) { this.code = code; } public String getMsg() { return msg; } public void setMsg(String msg) { this.msg = msg; } public Object getData() { return data; } public void setData(Object data) { this.data = data; } public static Result success(Object data){ return new Result(1, \u0026#34;success\u0026#34;, data); } public static Result success(){ return new Result(1, \u0026#34;success\u0026#34;, null); } public static Result error(String msg){ return new Result(0, msg, null); } @Override public String toString() { return \u0026#34;Result{\u0026#34; + \u0026#34;code=\u0026#34; + code + \u0026#34;, msg=\u0026#39;\u0026#34; + msg + \u0026#39;\\\u0026#39;\u0026#39; + \u0026#34;, data=\u0026#34; + data + \u0026#39;}\u0026#39;; } } Then the above code can be changed to:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/hello\u0026#34;) public Result hello(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;Hello SpringBoot\u0026#34;); return Result.success(\u0026#34;Hello SpringBoot\u0026#34;); } @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/getAddr\u0026#34;) public Result getAddr(){ Address address = new Address(); address.setProvince(\u0026#34;上海\u0026#34;); address.setCity(\u0026#34;上海\u0026#34;); return Result.success(address); } @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/listAddr\u0026#34;) public Result listAddr(){ List\u0026lt;Address\u0026gt; list = new ArrayList\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); Address address1 = new Address(); address1.setProvince(\u0026#34;北京\u0026#34;); address1.setCity(\u0026#34;北京\u0026#34;); Address address2 = new Address(); address2.setProvince(\u0026#34;上海\u0026#34;); address2.setCity(\u0026#34;上海\u0026#34;); list.add(address1); list.add(address2); return Result.success(list); } Visit the respective URLs to test.\n","date":"2024-01-14T16:47:28+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/144/","title":"Spring Request and Response"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Maven is a tool for managing and building Java projects.\nIt simplifies dependency management (jar files) to avoid version conflicts, provides a standard project structure, and offers a cross-platform automated build process.\nInstallation Download it from the official website and unzip it.

A single project can include multiple dependencies.\nConfiguration steps:\nAdd the \u0026lt;dependencies\u0026gt; tag in pom.xml. Use the \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; tag inside \u0026lt;dependencies\u0026gt; to import coordinates. Define the groupId, artifactId, and version. Refresh the configuration to import the new dependencies. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 \u0026lt;!-- Example: Importing logback --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dependencies\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;ch.qos.logback\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;logback-classic\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;1.2.3\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependencies\u0026gt; You can find dependency coordinates at https://mvnrepository.com/ .\nDependency Transitivity Dependencies are transitive.\nDirect Dependency: A dependency explicitly defined in the current project. Indirect Dependency: When a dependency depends on other resources, the current project implicitly depends on those resources. When you add a dependency that relies on other packages, those packages are added automatically.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t need a specific sub-dependency, you can exclude it (this breaks the dependency link; no version is required for excluded resources).\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 \u0026lt;!-- Example: Excluding junit from a project --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;com.yexca\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;maven-project\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;1.0-SNAPSHOT\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;exclusions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;exclusion\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;junit\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;junit\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/exclusion\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/exclusions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; Dependency Scope By default, jar files are available everywhere.

Each lifecycle consists of several phases. Phases are sequential; later phases depend on the completion of earlier ones.\nclean pre-clean clean: Removes files generated by previous builds (the target folder). post-clean default validate initialize generate-sources process-sources generate-resources process-resources compile: Compiles the source code. process-classes generate-test-sources process-test-sources generate-test-resources process-test-resources test-compile process-test-classes test: Runs tests using a unit testing framework (e.g., JUnit). prepare-package package: Packages compiled code (e.g., jar, war). verify install: Installs the project into the local repository. deploy site pre-site site post-site site-deploy Within the same lifecycle, running a later phase automatically triggers all preceding phases.\nMulti-module Design Multi-module design allows splitting a large project into several independent modules during the design phase. If one module needs functionality from another, it can simply depend on that module.\nCommon entities or utility classes can be placed in separate modules to be shared. This improves project management, maintenance, scalability, and resource sharing.\nInheritance Dependencies like Lombok might be used in every module. Instead of declaring it in every module, you can use inheritance.\nInheritance Relationship Create a parent project and move shared dependencies to its configuration. Child projects inheriting from the parent will automatically inherit these dependencies, eliminating redundant configuration.\nInheritance describes the relationship between two projects, similar to inheritance in Java. It simplifies dependency management and ensures consistency.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \u0026lt;!-- Specifying the parent project --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;parent\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;relativePath\u0026gt;....\u0026lt;/relativePath\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/parent\u0026gt; In JavaWeb development, the parent project can inherit from spring-boot-starter-parent, while other modules inherit from that parent project.\nUsually, child projects are located in subdirectories of the parent project.\nExample:\nParent project packaging type is pom: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 \u0026lt;parent\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.boot\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-boot-starter-parent\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;2.7.5\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;relativePath/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- lookup parent from repository --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/parent\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;net.yexca\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;tlias-parent\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;1.0-SNAPSHOT\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;packaging\u0026gt;pom\u0026lt;/packaging\u0026gt; Maven Packaging Types:\njar: Standard module packaging.

This gets tedious with many modules.\nMaven aggregation allows for one-click project builds (clean, compile, test, package, install, etc.).\nAggregation: Organizing multiple modules into a single unit for simultaneous building. Aggregation Project: An \u0026ldquo;empty\u0026rdquo; project containing only a pom.xml (usually the same as the parent project in inheritance). Purpose: Fast project building without manually following dependency order. Define sub-modules in the aggregation project using the \u0026lt;modules\u0026gt; tag.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \u0026lt;!-- Aggregating other modules --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;modules\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Project paths --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;module\u0026gt;../tlias-pojo\u0026lt;/module\u0026gt; \u0026lt;module\u0026gt;../tlias-utils\u0026lt;/module\u0026gt; \u0026lt;module\u0026gt;../tlias-web-management\u0026lt;/module\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/modules\u0026gt; Running compile, package, or install on the aggregation project will automatically sync those operations to all sub-modules.\nFeature Inheritance Aggregation Purpose Simplifies dependency config and management. Enables rapid project building. Similarities Packaging is pom; usually combined in the same file. Design-oriented modules with no actual source code. Differences Relationship defined in child modules. Parent doesn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;know\u0026rdquo; children. Relationship defined in the aggregator. Aggregator \u0026ldquo;knows\u0026rdquo; children. Private Repositories A private repository (Nexus, Artifactory) is a remote repository hosted on a local network. It acts as a proxy for the central repository and facilitates resource sharing and synchronization within a team.\nWhen a project needs a dependency, Maven checks the local repo. If missing, it checks the private repo. If the private repo doesn\u0026rsquo;t have it, it downloads it from the central repository, caches it, and serves it to the local repo.\nCompanies usually provide a private repository, so you won\u0026rsquo;t need to configure your own.\nPrivate Repo Types and Project Versions Private Repo Categories:\nRELEASE: For finished RELEASE versions of internal code. SNAPSHOT: For internal development SNAPSHOT versions. Central: Proxied dependencies downloaded from the Maven Central Repository. Project Versioning:\nRELEASE: Stable, finished versions for deployment, stored in the RELEASE repo. SNAPSHOT: Unstable, work-in-progress versions, stored in the SNAPSHOT repo. Configuration Set the private repo username and password in conf/settings.xml under the \u0026lt;servers\u0026gt; tag:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 \u0026lt;servers\u0026gt; \u0026lt;server\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id\u0026gt;maven-releases\u0026lt;/id\u0026gt; \u0026lt;username\u0026gt;admin\u0026lt;/username\u0026gt; \u0026lt;password\u0026gt;admin\u0026lt;/password\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/server\u0026gt; \u0026lt;server\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id\u0026gt;maven-snapshots\u0026lt;/id\u0026gt; \u0026lt;username\u0026gt;admin\u0026lt;/username\u0026gt; \u0026lt;password\u0026gt;admin\u0026lt;/password\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/server\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/servers\u0026gt; Configure the download address in settings.xml using the \u0026lt;mirrors\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;profiles\u0026gt; tags:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 \u0026lt;mirrors\u0026gt; \u0026lt;mirror\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id\u0026gt;maven-public\u0026lt;/id\u0026gt; \u0026lt;mirrorOf\u0026gt;*\u0026lt;/mirrorOf\u0026gt; \u0026lt;url\u0026gt;http://127.0.0.1:8081/repository/maven-public/\u0026lt;/url\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/mirror\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/mirrors\u0026gt; \u0026lt;profiles\u0026gt; \u0026lt;profile\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id\u0026gt;allow-snapshots\u0026lt;/id\u0026gt; \u0026lt;activation\u0026gt; \u0026lt;activeByDefault\u0026gt;true\u0026lt;/activeByDefault\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/activation\u0026gt; \u0026lt;repositories\u0026gt; \u0026lt;repository\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id\u0026gt;maven-public\u0026lt;/id\u0026gt; \u0026lt;url\u0026gt;http://127.0.0.1:8081/repository/maven-public/\u0026lt;/url\u0026gt; \u0026lt;releases\u0026gt; \u0026lt;enabled\u0026gt;true\u0026lt;/enabled\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/releases\u0026gt; \u0026lt;snapshots\u0026gt; \u0026lt;enabled\u0026gt;true\u0026lt;/enabled\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/snapshots\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/repository\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/repositories\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/profile\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/profiles\u0026gt; Configure the upload target in the parent project\u0026rsquo;s pom.xml:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 \u0026lt;distributionManagement\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Release release address --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;repository\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id\u0026gt;maven-releases\u0026lt;/id\u0026gt; \u0026lt;url\u0026gt;http://127.0.0.1:8081/repository/maven-releases/\u0026lt;/url\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/repository\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Snapshot release address --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;snapshotRepository\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id\u0026gt;maven-snapshots\u0026lt;/id\u0026gt; \u0026lt;url\u0026gt;http://127.0.0.1:8081/repository/maven-snapshots/\u0026lt;/url\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/snapshotRepository\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/distributionManagement\u0026gt; Once configured, execute the deploy lifecycle phase on the parent project to publish it to the private repository.\n","date":"2024-01-13T23:58:42+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/143/","title":"Learning Maven"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview SpringBoot Getting Started Example Goal: Build a web application using SpringBoot where a browser request to /hello returns the string \u0026ldquo;Hello Spring\u0026rdquo;.\nFirst, create a SpringBoot project and select the web development dependencies.\nNext, create a controller class.

It lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.\nStructure Key components:\nVisitor Declares a Visit operation for each class of ConcreteElement in the object structure. The operation\u0026rsquo;s name uniquely identifies the class sending the Visit request, allowing the visitor to determine the specific class of the element being visited. This lets the visitor access the element directly through its specific interface. ConcreteVisitor Implements each operation declared by Visitor. Each operation implements a part of the algorithm, specific to the class of the object in the structure. ConcreteVisitor provides context for the algorithm and stores its local state, which is often accumulated during structure traversal. Element Defines an Accept operation that takes a visitor as an argument. ConcreteElement Implements the Accept operation, taking a visitor as an argument. ObjectStructure Can enumerate its elements. It provides a high-level interface allowing the visitor to access its elements. It can be a composite or a collection, like a list or an unordered set. Applicability The Visitor pattern is suitable when:\nAn object structure contains many classes of objects with different interfaces, and you want to perform operations on these objects that depend on their concrete classes. You need to perform many different, unrelated operations on objects in an object structure, but want to avoid \u0026ldquo;polluting\u0026rdquo; their classes with these operations. Visitor allows you to centralize related operations into a single class. When the object structure is shared by many applications, using the Visitor pattern lets each application only include the operations it needs. The classes defining the object structure rarely change, but you frequently need to define new operations on this structure. Changing an object structure class requires redefining the interface for all visitors, which can be costly. If object structure classes change frequently, it might be better to define these operations directly within those classes. Example 1 In a library management system, two types of literature are managed: books and articles. The requirement is to calculate the total number of pages for all collected literature using the Visitor pattern. The class diagram is as follows:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 interface LibraryVisitor{ void visit(Book p_book);

Template Method allows subclasses to redefine parts of an algorithm without messing with its structure.\nStructure Key components:\nAbstractClass (抽象类): Defines abstract primitive operations that concrete subclasses will redefine to implement the algorithm\u0026rsquo;s steps. It also implements the template method, which sets up the algorithm\u0026rsquo;s skeleton. This template method calls both primitive operations and other operations defined in AbstractClass or other objects. ConcreteClass (具体类): Implements the primitive operations to complete the algorithm\u0026rsquo;s steps specific to that subclass. When to Use It Use the Template Method pattern when:\nYou want to implement an algorithm\u0026rsquo;s unchanging parts just once, letting subclasses handle the variable behaviors. You have common behavior across multiple subclasses that should be pulled into a single parent class to prevent code duplication. You need to control how subclasses extend functionality. The template method calls \u0026lsquo;hook\u0026rsquo; operations (default behaviors subclasses can override) at specific points, limiting extensions to these predefined spots.

This pattern allows an algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it.\nStructure Here\u0026rsquo;s the breakdown:\nStrategy: Defines a common interface for all supported algorithms. The Context uses this interface to call an algorithm defined by a ConcreteStrategy.\nConcreteStrategy: Implements a specific algorithm using the Strategy interface.\nContext: Is configured with a ConcreteStrategy object; maintains a reference to a Strategy object; can define an interface to allow the Strategy to access its data.\nApplicability The Strategy pattern is useful when:\nMany related classes differ only in their behavior. The \u0026ldquo;Strategy\u0026rdquo; provides a way to configure a class with one of multiple behaviors.\nYou need different variants of an algorithm. For example, algorithms that reflect different space/time tradeoffs. When these variants are implemented as a class hierarchy for an algorithm, the Strategy pattern can be used.\nAn algorithm uses data that clients shouldn\u0026rsquo;t know about. The Strategy pattern can hide complex, algorithm-specific data structures from clients.\nA class defines many behaviors, and these appear as multiple conditional statements within its operations. Move related conditional branches into their respective Strategy classes to replace these statements.\nExample 1 A large shopping mall wants to develop cashier software that supports various promotional activities over different periods, such as discounts or cashback (e.g., spend 300, get 100 back). The Strategy pattern is used to meet this requirement.

The object will appear to have modified its class.\nStructure Participants:\nContext: Defines the interface of interest to clients. It maintains an instance of a ConcreteState subclass that defines the current state.\nState: Defines an interface for encapsulating the behavior associated with a particular state of the Context.\nConcreteState: Each subclass implements a behavior associated with a state of the Context.\nApplicability An object\u0026rsquo;s behavior depends on its state, and it must change its behavior at runtime depending on that state.\nOperations have large, multipart conditional statements that depend on the object\u0026rsquo;s state. This state is usually represented by one or more enumerated constants. Often, several operations will contain this same conditional structure. The State pattern puts each branch of the conditional into a separate class. This lets you treat the object\u0026rsquo;s state as an object in its own right that can vary independently from other objects.\nExample 1 A large shopping mall has installed several simple tissue vending machines. They sell one pack of tissues for 2 dollars, dispensing only one pack at a time.

Sends a notification to its observers when its state changes. ConcreteObserver: Maintains a reference to a ConcreteSubject. Stores state that should stay consistent with the subject\u0026rsquo;s. Implements the Observer updating interface to keep its state consistent with the subject\u0026rsquo;s. Applicability Use the Observer pattern when:\nAn abstraction has two aspects, one dependent on the other. Encapsulating these in separate objects lets you vary and reuse them independently. A change to one object requires changing others, and you don\u0026rsquo;t know how many objects need to be changed. An object needs to notify other objects without making assumptions about who these objects are (i.e., you want to avoid tight coupling). Example 1 In a file management system, OfficeDoc and DocExplorer classes are defined. When an OfficeDoc object changes, all DocExplorer objects must update their state. Here is the class diagram using the Observer pattern:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 import java.util.*; interface Observer { public void update(); } interface Subject { public void Attach(Observer obs); public void Detach(Observer obs); public void Notify(); public void setStatus(int status); public int getStatus(); } class OfficeDoc implements Subject { private List\u0026lt;Observer\u0026gt; myObs; private String mySubjectName; private int m_status; public OfficeDoc(String name) { mySubjectName = name; this.myObs = new ArrayList\u0026lt;Observer\u0026gt;(); m_status = 0; } public void Attach(Observer obs) { this.myObs.add(obs); } public void Detach(Observer obs) { this.myObs.remove(obs); } public void Notify() { for (Observer obs : this.myObs) {obs.update(); } } public void setStatus(int status) { m_status = status; System.out.println(\u0026#34;SetStatus subject[\u0026#34; + mySubjectName + \u0026#34;]status:\u0026#34; + status); } public int getStatus() { return m_status; } } class DocExplorer implements Observer { private String myObsName; public DocExplorer(String name,Subject sub) { myObsName = name; sub.Attach(this); } public void update() { System.out.println(\u0026#34;update observer[\u0026#34; + myObsName + \u0026#34;]\u0026#34;); } } class ObserverTest { public static void main(String[] args) { Subject subjectA = new OfficeDoc(\u0026#34;subject A\u0026#34;); Observer observerA = new DocExplorer(\u0026#34;observer A\u0026#34;, subjectA); subjectA.setStatus(1); subjectA.Notify(); } } Example 2 Subject acts as a YouTuber, and Observer acts as a Subscriber.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.List; public class ObserverPattern { public static void main(String[] args) { Subject subjectA = new ConcerteSubject(); Observer observer1 = new ConcerteObserver(\u0026#34;Mike\u0026#34;, subjectA); Observer observer2 = new ConcerteObserver(\u0026#34;Jane\u0026#34;, subjectA); subjectA.Notify(); } } interface Subject{ // Subject public void Attach(Observer observer); public void Detach(Observer observer); public void Notify(); public String getState(); public void setState(String state); } class ConcerteSubject implements Subject{ private String state; private List\u0026lt;Observer\u0026gt; observerList; public String getState() { return state; } @Override public void setState(String state) { this.state = state; this.Notify(); } public ConcerteSubject(){ state = \u0026#34;-1\u0026#34;; observerList = new ArrayList\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); } public void Attach(Observer observer){ observerList.add(observer); } public void Detach(Observer observer){ observerList.remove(observer); } public void Notify(){ for(Observer o : observerList){ o.update(); } } } interface Observer{ // Observer public void update(); } class ConcerteObserver implements Observer{ private String name; private Subject subject; private String state; public ConcerteObserver(String name, Subject subject){ this.name = name; this.state = subject.getState(); this.subject = subject; subject.Attach(this); } @Override public void update(){ System.out.println(this.name + \u0026#34; Received\u0026#34;); this.state = subject.getState(); } } ","date":"2023-12-21T01:18:25+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/134/","title":"Observer Pattern"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview I\u0026rsquo;ve been into ASMR and doujin voice works since\u0026hellip; well, I don\u0026rsquo;t remember exactly when.

I specifically changed my blog domain from yexca.xyz to blog.yexca.xyz just to free up the root domain. I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect it to take until this new server to actually start.\nThe domain yexca.xyz no longer belongs to me.\nI checked my old project files—created March 2022, last modified June 2022. My procrastination is getting serious.\nThe idea came from seeing other bloggers\u0026rsquo; intro pages, like https://idealclover.top/ , https://the.moe/ , and others. It\u0026rsquo;s been so long I can\u0026rsquo;t find all of them (and some have updated to look even cooler).\nSome are open source where you just fill in your info to generate a page.\nIn the end, I chose to mimic the http://lolicon.app style.

The Mediator pattern promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, allowing you to vary their interaction independently.\nStructure Participants:\nMediator: Defines an interface for communicating with Colleague objects. ConcreteMediator: Implements cooperative behavior by coordinating Colleague objects; it knows and maintains its colleagues. Colleague class: Each colleague knows its Mediator object; colleagues communicate with the mediator whenever they would have otherwise communicated with another colleague. Applicability Use the Mediator pattern when:\nA set of objects communicate in well-defined but complex ways, resulting in tangled and hard-to-understand dependencies. An object references many other objects and communicates with them directly, making the object difficult to reuse. A behavior distributed among several classes should be customizable without creating many subclasses.

ConcreteFlyweight: Implements the Flyweight interface and adds storage for intrinsic state, if any. ConcreteFlyweight objects must be sharable. Any state it stores must be intrinsic (independent of the object\u0026rsquo;s context). UnsharedConcreteFlyweight: Not all Flyweight subclasses need to be shared. The Flyweight interface enables sharing, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t force it. UnsharedConcreteFlyweight objects often have ConcreteFlyweight objects as children. FlyweightFactory: Creates and manages flyweight objects. Ensures that flyweights are shared properly. When a client requests a flyweight, the factory provides an existing instance or creates one if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist. Client: Maintains a reference to flyweights and computes or stores their extrinsic state. Applicability Use the Flyweight pattern when:\nAn application uses a large number of objects. Storage costs are high because of the quantity of objects. Most object state can be made extrinsic. Many groups of objects may be replaced by relatively few shared objects once extrinsic state is removed. The application doesn\u0026rsquo;t depend on object identity.

Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.\nStructure Participants:\nFacade: Knows which subsystem classes are responsible for a request; delegates client requests to appropriate subsystem objects. Subsystem classes: Implement subsystem functionality; handle work assigned by the Facade object; have no knowledge of the Facade (i.e., they keep no reference to it). Applicability Use the Facade pattern when:\nYou want to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem. Subsystems often get more complex as they evolve. Most patterns result in more but smaller classes, making the subsystem more reusable and easier to customize, but harder to use for clients that don\u0026rsquo;t need customization. A facade provides a simple default view that is good enough for most users. There are many dependencies between clients and the implementation classes of an abstraction. Introducing a facade decouples the subsystem from clients and other subsystems, improving independence and portability. You want to layer your subsystems. Use a facade to define an entry point to each subsystem level. If subsystems are dependent, they can communicate solely through their facades, simplifying the dependencies between them. Example 1 Think of a hospital. To get treatment, a patient usually interacts with various departments: registration, outpatient, pharmacy, etc. To simplify this, a receptionist role can be introduced to handle these steps for the patient. The patient only needs to interact with the receptionist.\nJava Code 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 import java.util.*; interface Patient { public String getName(); } interface Disposer { public void dispose(Patient patient); } class Registry implements Disposer { // Registration public void dispose(Patient patient) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;I am registering...\u0026#34; + patient.getName()); } } class Doctor implements Disposer { // Outpatient Doctor public void dispose(Patient patient) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;I am diagnosing...\u0026#34; + patient.getName()); } } class Pharmacy implements Disposer { // Pharmacy public void dispose(Patient patient) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;I am medicine... \u0026#34; + patient.getName()); } } class Facade { private Patient patient; public Facade(Patient patient) { this.patient = patient; } void dispose() { Registry registry = new Registry(); Doctor doctor = new Doctor(); Pharmacy pharmacy = new Pharmacy(); registry.dispose(patient); doctor.dispose(patient); pharmacy.dispose(patient); } } class ConcretePatient implements Patient { private String name; public ConcretePatient(String name) { this.name = name; } public String getName() { return name; } } public class FacadeTest { public static void main(String[] args) { Patient patient = new ConcretePatient(\u0026#34;zst\u0026#34;); Facade f = new Facade(patient); f.dispose(); } } C++ Code 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 #include \u0026lt;iostream\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;string\u0026gt; using namespace std; class Patient { public: virtual string getName() = 0; }; class Disposer { public: virtual void dispose(Patient *patient) = 0; }; class Registry : public Disposer { // Registration public: void dispose(Patient *patient) { cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;I am registering....\u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; patient-\u0026gt;getName() \u0026lt;\u0026lt; endl; } }; class Doctor : public Disposer { // Outpatient Doctor public: void dispose(Patient *patient) { cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;I am diagnosing....\u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; patient-\u0026gt;getName() \u0026lt;\u0026lt; endl; } }; class Pharmacy : public Disposer { // Pharmacy public: void dispose(Patient *patient) { cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;I am giving medicine....\u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; patient-\u0026gt;getName() \u0026lt;\u0026lt; endl; } }; class Facade { private: Patient *patient; public: Facade(Patient *patient) { this-\u0026gt;patient = patient; } void dispose() { Registry *registry = new Registry(); Doctor *doctor = new Doctor(); Pharmacy *pharmacy = new Pharmacy(); registry-\u0026gt;dispose(patient); doctor-\u0026gt;dispose(patient); pharmacy-\u0026gt;dispose(patient); } }; class ConcretePatient : public Patient { private: string name; public: ConcretePatient(string name) { this-\u0026gt;name = name; } string getName() { return name; } }; int main() { Patient *patient = new ConcretePatient(\u0026#34;zst\u0026#34;); Facade *f = new Facade(patient); f-\u0026gt;dispose(); return 0; } Example 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 public class FacadePattern { public static void main(String[] args) { Facade f = new Facade(); f.methodA(); } } class Facade{ SubSystemOne s1; SubSystemTwo s2; SubSystemThree s3; public Facade(){ s1 = new SubSystemOne(); s2 = new SubSystemTwo(); s3 = new SubSystemThree(); } public void methodA(){ s1.Operation(); } public void methodB(){ s2.Operation(); } public void methodC(){ s3.Operation(); } } class SubSystemOne{ public void Operation(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;SubSystemOne\u0026#34;); } } class SubSystemTwo{ public void Operation(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;SubSystemTwo\u0026#34;); } } class SubSystemThree{ public void Operation(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;SubSystemThree\u0026#34;); } } ","date":"2023-09-06T03:02:02+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/121/","title":"Facade Pattern"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash Decorator Pattern: A Structural Design Pattern\nIntent Dynamically add extra responsibilities to an object. When it comes to extending functionality, the Decorator pattern is more flexible than subclassing.\nStructure Here\u0026rsquo;s the breakdown:\nComponent defines an interface for objects, allowing responsibilities to be dynamically added. ConcreteComponent defines an object to which responsibilities can be added. Decorator holds a reference to a Component object and defines an interface consistent with Component\u0026rsquo;s. ConcreteDecorator adds responsibilities to the component. Applicability The Decorator pattern is useful when:\nYou need to add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently, without affecting other objects. You need to handle responsibilities that can be undone. Subclassing isn\u0026rsquo;t a practical way to extend functionality. For instance, if you have many independent extensions, subclassing would lead to an explosion of classes to support every combination. Another case is when the class definition is hidden or just not available for subclassing. Example 1 A coffee shop lets customers add various condiments to their coffee. The shop calculates the cost based on the added condiments.

Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.\nStructure Here:\nComponent declares an interface for objects in the composition; implements default behavior for the interface common to all classes where appropriate; declares an interface for accessing and managing Component\u0026rsquo;s children; (optional) defines an interface for accessing a parent component in the recursive structure and implements it where appropriate. Leaf represents leaf objects in the composition, which have no children; defines the behavior of primitive objects in the composition.

It maintains a pointer to an object of type Implementor. RefinedAbstraction: Extends the interface defined by Abstraction. Implementor: Defines the interface for implementation classes. This interface doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be exactly the same as Abstraction\u0026rsquo;s interface; in fact, the two interfaces can be completely different. Generally, the Implementor interface provides only basic operations, while Abstraction defines higher-level operations based on these primitives. ConcreteImplementor: Implements the Implementor interface and defines its concrete implementation. Applicability The Bridge pattern is useful when:\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t want a fixed binding between an abstraction and its implementation. For example, the implementation might need to be selected or switched at runtime. Both the class abstraction and its implementation should be extensible via subclassing. The Bridge pattern allows developers to combine different abstract interfaces and implementations, and extend them independently. Changes to an abstraction\u0026rsquo;s implementation should not affect clients. Client code shouldn\u0026rsquo;t need recompiling. (C++) You want to completely hide the abstraction\u0026rsquo;s implementation from clients. You have a class hierarchy with many classes to generate. You want to share an implementation among multiple objects (possibly using reference counting), but without the client knowing about it.

The Adapter pattern allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together.\nStructure Class Adapter uses multiple inheritance to match one interface to another. Object Adapter relies on object composition. Here\u0026rsquo;s what each part does:\nTarget defines the domain-specific interface that Client uses. Client collaborates with objects conforming to the Target interface. Adaptee defines an existing interface that needs adapting. Adapter adapts Adaptee\u0026rsquo;s interface to the Target interface. Applicability Use the Adapter pattern when:\nYou want to use an existing class, but its interface doesn\u0026rsquo;t match what you need. You want to create a reusable class that can work with other unrelated or unforeseen classes (i.e., those whose interfaces might not be compatible). (Object Adapter only) You want to use an existing subclass, but it\u0026rsquo;s impractical to subclass every one to match their interfaces. An object adapter can adapt its parent class\u0026rsquo;s interface. Example 1 In a software system, an Address class has been designed and implemented to display address information. Now, there\u0026rsquo;s a requirement to provide a Dutch-language interface for address display. To meet this, and anticipating future language interfaces, the Adapter pattern is chosen.

The created instances usually share a common parent class.\nSince the methods used to create instances in this pattern are typically static, it is also known as the Static Factory Method pattern.\nYou pass a parameter for the product you need, and the factory returns the object without you needing to know the implementation details.\nExample: A dumpling shop. When a customer wants a specific type of dumpling, the shop produces it. Here, the shop is the Factory, the dumpling is the Product, and the dumpling name is the parameter.\nIf a customer wants \u0026ldquo;Leek Dumplings,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Leek\u0026rdquo; is the parameter, and the shop returns the specific product (assuming they have it).\nThree Roles:\nFactory (Core) Handles the internal logic for creating all products. It is called directly by the client to create objects.\nAbstract Product The parent class for all objects created by the factory, defining common methods. Concrete products inherit from this.\nConcrete Product The target of the creation; instances of specific classes created by the factory.\nExample 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 public class SimpleFactory{ public static void main(String[] args){ Product productA = Factory.createProduct(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;); productA.info(); // ... } } abstract class Product{ public abstract void info(); } class ProductA extends Product{ @Override public void info(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;); } } class ProductB extends Product{ @Override public void info(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;B\u0026#34;); } } class Factory{ public static Product createProduct(String type){ Product p = null; // Exception handling omitted for brevity switch(type){ case \u0026#34;A\u0026#34;: p = new ProductA(); break; case \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;: p = new ProductB(); break; default: System.out.println(\u0026#34;Please try again\u0026#34;); break; } return p; } } Adding a new product requires modifying the factory class, which violates the Open-Closed Principle.\nFactory Method Pattern Factory Method Pattern - A Class Creational Pattern.\nIntent Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.\nStructure Roles:\nProduct: Defines the interface for the objects the factory method creates. ConcreteProduct: Implements the Product interface. Creator: Declares the factory method, which returns an object of type Product. It may also define a default implementation that returns a default ConcreteProduct. ConcreteCreator: Overrides the factory method to return an instance of a ConcreteProduct. Applicability Use the Factory Method pattern when:\nA class can\u0026rsquo;t anticipate the class of objects it must create. A class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates. Classes delegate responsibility to one of several helper subclasses, and you want to localize the knowledge of which helper subclass is the delegate. Example 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 // Modified from the previous example public class FactoryMethod{ public static void main(String[] args){ Factory factoryA = new FactoryA(); // Product productA = Factory.createProduct(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;); Product productA = factoryA.createProduct(); productA.info(); // ... } } // Abstract class changed to Interface interface Product{ public void info(); } // Inherit changed to Implement class ProductA implements Product{ @Override public void info(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;); } } class ProductB implements Product{ @Override public void info(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;B\u0026#34;); } } // Concrete class changed to Interface interface Factory{ public Product createProduct(); } // Added interface implementations class FactoryA implements Factory{ @Override public Product createProduct(){ return new ProductA(); } } class FactoryB implements Factory{ @Override public Product createProduct(){ return new ProductB(); } } Abstract Factory Pattern Abstract Factory Pattern - An Object Creational Pattern.\nIntent Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.\nStructure Roles:\nAbstractFactory: Declares an interface for operations that create abstract product objects. ConcreteFactory: Implements the operations to create concrete product objects. AbstractProduct: Declares an interface for a type of product object. ConcreteProduct: Defines a product object to be created by the corresponding concrete factory; implements the AbstractProduct interface. Client: Uses only interfaces declared by AbstractFactory and AbstractProduct classes. Applicability Use the Abstract Factory pattern when:\nA system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented. A system should be configured with one of multiple families of products. A family of related product objects is designed to be used together, and you need to enforce this constraint. You want to provide a class library of products, and you want to reveal just their interfaces, not their implementations.

Problem: Describes when to apply the pattern. Solution: Describes the elements that make up the design, their relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations. Consequences: The results and trade-offs of applying the pattern. Design patterns identify the classes and instances involved, their roles, collaborations, and responsibility distribution. Each pattern focuses on a specific object-oriented design problem or point, describing when to use it, whether it works under specific constraints, and the trade-offs involved. Based on their purpose, design patterns are divided into three main categories:\nCreational patterns deal with object creation; Structural patterns handle the composition of classes or objects; Behavioral patterns describe how classes or objects distribute responsibilities.\nCreational Structural Behavioral Class Factory Method Adapter (Class) Interpreter\nTemplate Method Object Abstract Factory\nBuilder\nPrototype\nSingleton Adapter (Object)\nBridge\nComposite\nDecorator\nFacade\nFlyweight\nProxy Chain of Responsibility\nCommand\nIterator\nMediator\nMemento\nObserver\nState\nStrategy\nVisitor Creational Design Patterns Creational patterns abstract the instantiation process. They help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. A class-creational pattern uses inheritance to vary the class being instantiated, while an object-creational pattern delegates instantiation to another object.\nAs systems evolve to depend more on object composition rather than class inheritance, creational patterns become more important. In these cases, the focus shifts from hard-coding a fixed set of behaviors to defining a small set of basic behaviors that can be composed into any number of complex ones. Creating an object with specific behavior then requires more than just instantiating a class.\nThere are two recurring themes in these patterns:\nThey encapsulate knowledge about which concrete classes the system uses. They hide how instances of these classes are created and put together. The system only knows about the objects through the interfaces defined by abstract classes. This provides significant flexibility in what is created, who creates it, how it\u0026rsquo;s created, and when. They allow a system to be configured with \u0026ldquo;product\u0026rdquo; objects that vary widely in structure and functionality. This configuration can be static (at compile-time) or dynamic (at runtime).\nStructural Design Patterns Structural patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. Structural class patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations. A simple example is using multiple inheritance to combine two or more classes into one, resulting in a class that possesses the properties of all its parents. This is particularly useful for making independently developed libraries work together (e.g., the class-based Adapter pattern). Generally, an adapter makes one interface compatible with others, providing a unified abstraction. To do this, a class adapter privately inherits from an adaptee class and expresses its interface using the adaptee\u0026rsquo;s interface.\nStructural object patterns don\u0026rsquo;t compose interfaces or implementations; instead, they describe ways to assemble objects to realize new functionality. Since object composition can be changed at runtime, it offers greater flexibility that is impossible with static class composition.\nBehavioral Design Patterns Behavioral patterns focus on algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. They describe not just patterns of objects or classes but also the communication patterns between them. These patterns characterize complex control flows that are difficult to track at runtime, shifting the developer\u0026rsquo;s attention away from control flow to focus on how objects are interconnected.\nBehavioral class patterns use inheritance to distribute behavior between classes. The Template Method is a common and simple example. It provides an abstract definition of an algorithm, defining it step-by-step. Each step calls either an abstract operation or a primitive operation, with subclasses implementing the abstract operations. Another example is the Interpreter, which represents a grammar as a class hierarchy and implements an interpreter as an operation on instances of those classes.\nBehavioral object patterns use object composition rather than inheritance. Some describe how a group of peer objects cooperate to perform a task that no single object can carry out alone. A key issue here is how peer objects stay aware of each other. Peer objects could maintain explicit references to each other, but that increases coupling. In the extreme case, every object would need to know about every other object. The Mediator pattern avoids this by introducing a mediator object between peers, providing the indirection required for loose coupling.\nRecommended Reading https://refactoringguru.cn/design-patterns ","date":"2023-05-17T22:50:20+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/108/","title":"Intro to Design Patterns"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Split tunneling rules for addressing connection issues from mainland China.\nKey Entering the game requires a UDP connection.

Most of the time, we draw diagrams as connected graphs with vertices (representing \u0026rsquo;things\u0026rsquo;) and arcs (representing relationships). To visualize a system, you can draw diagrams from different angles; they\u0026rsquo;re essentially projections of the system.\nUML 2.0 provides 13 types of diagrams: Class Diagram, Object Diagram, Use Case Diagram, Sequence Diagram, Communication Diagram, State Diagram, Activity Diagram, Component Diagram, Composite Structure Diagram, Deployment Diagram, Package Diagram, Interaction Overview Diagram, and Timing Diagram. Sequence, Communication, Interaction Overview, and Timing diagrams are all known as Interaction Diagrams.\n(I) Class Diagram A Class Diagram shows a set of objects, interfaces, collaborations, and their relationships. It\u0026rsquo;s the most common diagram type for modeling object-oriented systems. Class diagrams give you a static design view of the system. If it includes active classes, it also provides a static process view.\nTypically, a Class Diagram includes:\nClasses Interfaces Collaborations Dependency, Generalization, and Association relationships For example:\nStudent +id: int\n-name: String\n#age: int ~borrow(): bool +: public\n-: private\n#: protected\n~: package\nClass diagrams can also include notes and constraints. Plus, they can feature packages or subsystems, which help group model elements into larger chunks.\nClass diagrams are used for modeling the system\u0026rsquo;s static design view. This view mainly supports the system\u0026rsquo;s functional requirements – the services it provides to end-users. When modeling a system\u0026rsquo;s static design view, class diagrams are typically used in one of three ways:\nModeling the system\u0026rsquo;s vocabulary Modeling simple collaborations Modeling logical database schemas (II) Object Diagram An Object Diagram shows a set of objects and their relationships at a specific point in time. It\u0026rsquo;s essentially a static snapshot of instances defined in class diagrams. Object diagrams usually contain objects and links.\nObjectName : ClassName Attributes Like class diagrams, object diagrams provide a static design view or static process view of the system.\n(III) Use Case Diagram Use Case Diagrams show a set of use cases, actors, and their relationships.\nUse case diagrams typically include:\nUse Cases Actors \u0026lt;\u0026lt;extend\u0026gt;\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;\u0026lt;include\u0026gt;\u0026gt; relationships between use cases, association relationships between actors and use cases, and generalization relationships (between use cases, and between actors). Include Relationship\nOne use case includes another.\nBase Use Case \u0026ndash;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;include\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Included Use Case\nExtend Relationship\nWhen a use case runs, special or optional situations might pop up. These scenarios are considered \u0026rsquo;extended\u0026rsquo; use cases for the original.\nExtended Use Case \u0026ndash;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;extend\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Base Use Case\nUse case diagrams model the system\u0026rsquo;s static use case view. This view mainly covers system behavior – essentially, the externally visible services the system offers within its environment.\nWhen modeling the system\u0026rsquo;s static use case view, use case diagrams can be used in two ways:\nModeling the system\u0026rsquo;s context Modeling system requirements (IV) Interaction Diagrams Interaction diagrams model a system\u0026rsquo;s dynamic aspects. An interaction diagram shows an interaction: a set of objects, their relationships, and the messages they can exchange. These diagrams come as Sequence, Communication, Interaction Overview, and Timing diagrams. Each type serves a different purpose. Sequence diagrams highlight message timing. Communication diagrams focus on the structural arrangement of message-exchanging objects. Interaction overview diagrams emphasize control flow.\nInteraction diagrams generally include objects, links, and messages.\nSequence Diagram A Sequence Diagram is a visual representation of a scenario, detailing interactions between objects arranged chronologically. To build one, you put participating objects horizontally across the top. Usually, the initiator goes on the left, with subordinate objects to its right. Then, messages sent and received are stacked vertically, top-to-bottom, in time order. This gives you a clear visual trace of control flow as time progresses.\nSequence diagrams have two distinct features compared to communication diagrams:\nSequence diagrams have object lifelines. An object lifeline is a vertical dashed line indicating an object\u0026rsquo;s existence over a period. Sequence diagrams have focus of control. A focus of control is a tall, narrow rectangle indicating the time period an object spends performing an action, either directly or through a subordinate procedure. The top of the rectangle marks the start of the action, and the bottom marks its end. Communication Diagram A Communication Diagram (formerly \u0026lsquo;Collaboration Diagram\u0026rsquo;) emphasizes the structural setup of objects sending and receiving messages. It focuses on how objects involved in an interaction are organized. To make one, you start with participating objects as diagram vertices. Then, links between these objects become arcs. Finally, you decorate these links with the messages objects send and receive. This gives a clear visual trace of control flow within the structural context of the collaborating objects.\nCommunication diagrams have two distinct characteristics compared to sequence diagrams:\nCommunication diagrams have paths. To show how one object links to another, you can attach a path stereotype to the end of a link. Communication diagrams have sequence numbers. To indicate the temporal order of a message, you can prefix it with a number. In the control flow, each new message\u0026rsquo;s sequence number increases monotonically. For nesting, use decimal-point numbers. Sequence and communication diagrams are isomorphic and can be converted into each other.\n(V) State Diagram A State Diagram (or State Machine Diagram) shows a state machine, made up of states, transitions, events, and activities. State diagrams focus on a system\u0026rsquo;s dynamic view. They\u0026rsquo;re super important for modeling the behavior of interfaces, classes, and collaborations, highlighting the event-driven sequence of object actions.\nState diagrams typically include simple and composite states, as well as transitions (events and actions).\nStates A state is any observable system behavior pattern; it represents a single behavioral mode. States dictate how a system reacts to events. A system might respond by performing an action (or several), simply changing its own state, or doing both.\nIn state diagrams, you\u0026rsquo;ll mainly find initial states, final states, and intermediate states. An initial state is a solid black dot. A final state is a black dot inside a circle. Regular states in a state diagram are rounded rectangles.\nState transitions happen between states, shown by an arrowed line. The transition starts when the event on that arrowed line fires. A state diagram must have only one initial state, but it can have zero or many final states.\nThree standard events:\nentry: Entry action, executed immediately upon entering the state. exit: Exit action, executed immediately upon exiting the state. do: Internal activity, occupies a finite time and can be interrupted. From the example above:\nentry/turnON: When transitioning to this state, perform the \u0026rsquo;turn on light\u0026rsquo; action. do/blinkFivetimes: While in this state, the light blinks 5 times. exit/turnOFF: When transitioning out of this state, perform the \u0026rsquo;turn off light\u0026rsquo; action. Events and Transitions An event is something that occurs at a specific moment. It\u0026rsquo;s an abstraction of an external trigger causing a system to act or (and) transition between states. Think of a viewer using a TV remote, or a user moving/clicking a mouse – those are events. Basically, an event is control info that makes the system act or change state.\nState transitions are usually event-driven. When that\u0026rsquo;s the case, the event expression that triggers the transition should be labeled on the arrow representing the state change.\nIf an arrow lacks an event label, the transition triggers automatically once all internal activities of the source state are done. Here\u0026rsquo;s the syntax for an event expression:\nevent-specification[guard-condition]/action-expression\nWhere the syntax for event-specification is: eventName(parameterList)\nA guard condition is a Boolean expression. If you use both an event specification and a guard condition, the state transition fires only if the event occurs and the Boolean expression is true. If there\u0026rsquo;s just a guard condition without an event spec, the transition happens whenever that guard condition is true.\nTransitions involve two states (source state, target state) Events, guard conditions, actions\nEvents trigger transitions\nActivities (actions) can be performed within a state or during a state transition.\nComplete Diagram You can use state diagrams to model a system\u0026rsquo;s dynamic aspects. This includes the event-driven behavior of any object type present in the system\u0026rsquo;s architecture, like classes (especially active ones), interfaces, components, and nodes.\nWhen modeling the dynamic aspects of a system, class, or use case, you typically model reactive objects.\n(VI) Activity Diagram An Activity Diagram is a specialized state diagram that illustrates the flow from one activity to the next within a system. These diagrams zero in on a system\u0026rsquo;s dynamic view, are key for functional modeling, and highlight control flow between objects.\nActivity diagrams generally include activity states and action states, transitions, and objects.\nActivity diagrams can represent branches, merges, forks, and joins.\nWhen modeling the dynamic aspects of a system, there are generally two ways to use activity diagrams:\nModeling workflows Modeling operations (VII) Component Diagram A Component Diagram illustrates the organization and dependencies among a set of components. These diagrams focus on a system\u0026rsquo;s static implementation view. They\u0026rsquo;re related to class diagrams, with components often mapping to one or more classes, interfaces, or collaborations.\n(VIII) Deployment Diagram A Deployment Diagram models the physical aspects of an object-oriented system. It shows the configuration of runtime processing nodes and the components (artifacts) deployed on them. Deployment diagrams model the static deployment view and are linked to component diagrams. Usually, a node is a physical runtime element representing a computing resource. It has some content, often processing power, and contains one or more components. \u0026lt;\u0026lt;artifact\u0026gt;\u0026gt; here means an artifact.\nSummary Static Modeling: Class Diagram, Object Diagram, Use Case Diagram Dynamic Modeling: Sequence Diagram, Communication Diagram, State Machine Diagram, Activity Diagram Physical Modeling: Component Diagram, Deployment Diagram Interaction Diagrams: Sequence Diagram, Communication Diagram\n","date":"2023-04-13T20:02:00+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/104/","title":"Diagrams in UML"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash Object-oriented analysis focuses on defining the characteristics and behaviors of objects within a system. Many object-oriented methods have emerged internationally. The industry widely accepts UML (Unified Modeling Language).\nUML is the standardized modeling language for object-oriented software. Its simplicity, uniformity, and ability to express both dynamic and static information in software design have made it the de facto industry standard for visual modeling languages.\nUML consists of three core elements: its basic building blocks, the rules governing how these blocks are put together, and common mechanisms used throughout the language.\nUML\u0026rsquo;s vocabulary includes three kinds of building blocks: things, relationships, and diagrams. Things are abstractions of the most representative components in a model; relationships connect things; and diagrams group related things.\nThings UML has four types of things: structural things, behavioral things, grouping things, and annotational things.\n(1) Structural Things (Structural Thing) Structural things are the \u0026ldquo;nouns\u0026rdquo; in a UML model. They typically represent the static parts of a model, describing conceptual or physical elements.\nStructural things include:\nClass Interface Collaboration Use Case Active Class Component Artifact Node (2) Behavioral Things (Behavior thing) Behavioral things are the dynamic parts of a UML model. They are the \u0026ldquo;verbs\u0026rdquo; of the model, describing behavior across time and space.\nBehavioral things include:\nInteraction State Machine Activity (3) Grouping Things (Grouping Thing) Grouping things are the organizational parts of a UML model, acting like \u0026ldquo;boxes\u0026rdquo; that decompose the model. Among all grouping things, the primary one is the Package. A package is a mechanism for organizing elements into groups, serving various purposes. Structural things, behavioral things, and even other grouping things can be placed within a package. Unlike components (which only exist at runtime), a package is purely conceptual (i.e., it only exists during development).\n(4) Annotational Things (Annotational Thing) Annotational things are the explanatory parts of a UML model. These annotational things describe, specify, and mark any element of the model. A Note is the primary annotational thing. A note is a simple symbol attached to an element or a group of elements, providing constraints or explanations.\nRelationships UML defines four types of relationships: dependency, association, generalization, and realization.\nDependency (Dependency) A dependency is a semantic relationship between two things where a change in one thing (the independent thing) affects the semantics of the other (the dependent thing). Graphically, a dependency is drawn as a dashed line, which may be directed.\nAssociation (Association) An association is a structural relationship that describes a set of links, where a link is a connection between objects. Aggregation is a special type of association that describes a structural relationship between a whole and its parts. Associations can be labeled with multiplicity and role.\nAssociation, Aggregation, Composition Association: A structural relationship describing a set of links (connections between objects). Multiplicity and role can be labeled on an association. E.g., Employer and Employee.\nAggregation: The lifecycle of the part and the whole are inconsistent. If the whole disappears, the part still exists and can exist independently of the whole. E.g., Class and Student, Company and Employee.\nComposition: The lifecycle of the part and the whole are consistent. If the whole disappears, the part also disappears; the part cannot exist independently of the whole. E.g., Person and Brain.\nDependency vs. Unidirectional Association Dependency is more incidental, temporary. For instance: a person and food; dependent only when hungry, not when full.\nUnidirectional association is stronger, indicated by a single-headed arrow. For instance: a person and oxygen, a fish and water.\nGeneralization (Generalization) Generalization is a special/general relationship where objects of a specific element (child element) can substitute for objects of a general element (parent element). This way, child elements share the structure and behavior of parent elements. Graphically, it points to the parent element.\nRealization (Realization) Realization is a semantic relationship between classifiers, where one classifier specifies a contract that another classifier guarantees to execute. Realization relationships are used in two scenarios: between an interface and the classes or components that implement it, and between a use case and the collaborations that realize it.\n","date":"2023-04-11T08:01:00+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/103/","title":"UML"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview It took three months from the initial idea to full implementation (mostly because I was too lazy).\nInstalling Docker Installed using APT (on Debian).\nAdd packages for HTTPS transport and CA certificates. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # Update first sudo apt-get update # Then install sudo apt-get install \\ apt-transport-https \\ ca-certificates \\ curl \\ gnupg \\ lsb-release Add the GPG key for the software source to verify package legitimacy. 1 2 3 4 5 6 # China mirror curl -fsSL https://mirrors.aliyun.com/docker-ce/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg # Official source curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg Add the Docker repository to sources.list.

It consists of three main activities: quality assurance, quality planning, and quality control.\nSoftware Quality Assurance (SQA) refers to planned and organized activities conducted to ensure that the software system or product fully meets user quality requirements. Its purpose is to produce high-quality software.\nSoftware Quality Characteristics To discuss software quality, you first need to understand software quality characteristics. Several software quality models exist to describe these characteristics, such as the ISO/IEC 9126 software quality model and the Mc Call software quality model.\nISO/IEC 9126 Software Quality Model The ISO/IEC 9126 software quality model consists of three levels: the first level is quality characteristics, the second is quality sub-characteristics, and the third is metrics.\nFunctionality A set of attributes related to the existence of a set of functions and their specified properties. Functions are those that satisfy specified or implied needs.\nSuitability: Software attributes related to whether a set of functions is provided for specified tasks and whether these functions are appropriate.

Installability: Software attributes related to the effort required to install the software in a specified environment. Conformance: Software attributes that make the software adhere to standards or conventions related to portability. Replaceability: Software attributes related to the possibility and effort of using one software to replace another specified software in that software environment. Mc Call Software Quality Model The Mc Call software quality model defines 11 quality characteristics from three aspects of software products: product revision, product transition, and product operations.\nMc Call also provides a three-level model framework. The first level is quality characteristics, the second is evaluation criteria, and the third is metrics.\nSoftware Review Generally, \u0026ldquo;quality\u0026rdquo; is understood as \u0026ldquo;user satisfaction.\u0026rdquo; To satisfy users, the following two conditions are necessary:\nThe design specification meets user requirements, which is called design quality. The program executes correctly according to the design specification, which is called program quality. Review Content of Design Quality The objects of design quality review are the software requirement specifications and data requirement specifications produced during the requirement analysis phase, and the software preliminary design specifications produced during the preliminary design phase. Reviews are generally conducted from the following aspects:\nEvaluating whether software specifications meet user requirements, i.e., whether the overall design philosophy and design policy are clear; whether requirement specifications are approved by the user or higher authorities; and whether requirement specifications are consistent with preliminary design specifications. Reviewing reliability, i.e., whether input anomalies (errors or overloads), hardware failures, and software failures can be avoided, and whether alternative or recovery means can be taken promptly if they occur. Reviewing the implementation of security measures, i.e., whether system access credentials are checked. Reviewing the implementation of operational characteristics, i.e., the appropriateness of operation commands and information; the appropriateness of input data and input control statements; the appropriateness of output data; and the appropriateness of response times. Reviewing performance implementation, i.e., whether specified performance target values are achieved. Reviewing whether the software has modifiability, extensibility, interchangeability, and portability. Reviewing whether the software has testability. Reviewing whether the software has reusability. Review Content of Program Quality Program quality review is usually conducted from the developer\u0026rsquo;s perspective and is directly related to development technology. It focuses on the software\u0026rsquo;s own structure, interfaces with the operating environment, and the impact of changes.\nThe structure of the software includes:\nFunctional structure. Items to check: Data structure Functional structure Correspondence between data structure and functional structure Generality of functions Module hierarchy Module structure. While module hierarchy is static, the dynamic structure must also be checked. Modules are divided into processing modules and data modules. Checking items for such structures include: Control flow structure Data flow structure Correspondence between module structure and functional structure Structure of the processing procedures Interfaces with Operating Environment The operating environment includes hardware, other software, and users. Main inspection items include:\nInterface with hardware. Including interface conventions with hardware, i.e., regulations made according to hardware manuals; handling of hardware failures and overloads. Interface with users. Including interface conventions with users, i.e., input data structure; output data structure; handling of abnormal inputs and overload inputs; user access credential checks, etc. Software Fault Tolerance Technology Technologies to improve software quality and reliability can be roughly divided into two categories: error avoidance (preventing errors from entering software during development) and fault tolerance (minimizing the impact of unavoidable errors).\nDefinition of Fault-Tolerant Software Software with specified functions that has the ability to shield the effects of its own errors (software errors) to a certain extent. Software with specified functions that can automatically recover from an error state to a normal state to a certain extent. Software with specified functions that can still complete expected functions to a certain extent when an error occurs. Software with specified functions that possesses fault-tolerance capabilities to a certain extent. General Methods for Fault Tolerance The primary means of implementing fault tolerance is redundancy. Redundancy refers to resources added beyond those strictly necessary to implement the system\u0026rsquo;s specified functions, including hardware, software, information, and time. These resources can significantly improve system reliability. Generally, redundancy technology is divided into four categories:\nStructural Redundancy. This is the most common technique, divided into three types based on operation: Static redundancy Dynamic redundancy Hybrid redundancy Information Redundancy. Adding extra information to detect or correct errors in computation or transmission. Time Redundancy. Repeating the execution of instructions or programs to eliminate the impact of transient errors. Redundancy Overhead Technology. The resources and techniques required to implement the above redundancy technologies, including programs, instructions, data, and the space and channels to store and move them. In fault tolerance for shielding hardware errors, redundancy overhead technology includes:\nRedundant storage and invocation of critical programs and data. Implementation of detection, voting, switching, reconfiguration, error correction, and recalculation. In fault-tolerant systems for shielding software errors, redundancy overhead technology includes:\nStorage and invocation of redundant backup programs. Programs for error detection and error recovery. Firmware required to implement fault-tolerant software. Software Tools Software used to assist activities in software development, operation, maintenance, management, and support processes is called a software tool.\nSoftware Development Tools Corresponding to various activities in the software development process, development tools usually include requirement analysis tools, design tools, coding and debugging tools, testing tools, etc.\nSoftware Maintenance Tools Software that assists activities in the software maintenance process is called a software maintenance tool. It helps maintenance personnel perform various tasks on software code and documentation. Main maintenance tools include version control tools, document analysis tools, development information repository tools, reverse engineering tools, and re-engineering tools.\n","date":"2023-04-03T19:59:00+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/101/","title":"Software Engineering - Software Quality and Software Tools"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Software Engineering Series - Article 5\nSoftware projects fail a lot. Usually, it\u0026rsquo;s because project management is weak. Due to the unique nature and complexity of software, applying project management principles to the software engineering field gives us Software Project Management.\nThe Scope of Software Project Management Effective software project management focuses on the \u0026ldquo;4 Ps\u0026rdquo;: People, Product, Process, and Project.\nSoftware Project Estimation Software project estimation involves many factors like people, technology, and environment. You need specific methods to back up your estimates. Here are three common ones:\nEstimating based on similar completed projects. Estimating based on decomposition techniques. Estimating based on empirical models. Typical examples include the IBM model, COCOMO model, and Putnam model. You can mix these methods to improve accuracy.\nCOCOMO Estimation Model The Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) is a precise and widely used cost estimation model. It is divided into three levels of detail: Basic, Intermediate, and Detailed.\nBasic COCOMO Model Basic COCOMO is a static, single-variable model used to estimate the entire software system.\nThe formulas are:\nE=a(L)b D=cEd Where E is effort (person-months); D is development time (months); L is the estimated thousands of source lines of code (KLOC), excluding comments and docs; and a, b, c, d are constants.\nWith Basic COCOMO, you estimate the code lines (L) first, then calculate the effort and time.\nIntermediate COCOMO Model Intermediate COCOMO is a static, multi-variable model. it treats the software system at two levels: system and component. It views effort as a function of program size and a set of \u0026ldquo;cost drivers.\u0026rdquo;\nIt builds on the Basic model but adds 15 factors affecting effort, using an Effort Adjustment Factor (EAF) to refine the estimate.\nThe formula is:\nE=a(L)bEAF Where L is KLOC, and a and b are constants.\nDetailed COCOMO Model This model breaks things down into three levels: system, subsystem, and module. Besides Intermediate factors, it considers the impact of cost drivers at specific stages like requirements analysis and software design.\nCOCOMO II Model The original COCOMO was huge in the industry, and it has evolved into COCOMO II. Like its predecessor, COCOMO II is a hierarchical model with three stages:\nApplication Composition Model: Used in early stages for UI prototyping, system interaction, and performance/maturity assessment. Early Design Stage Model: Used once requirements are stable and the basic architecture is set. Post-Architecture Stage Model: Used during the actual construction of the software. COCOMO II uses size estimates like Object Points, Function Points, or Lines of Code. Application Composition uses Object Points; Early Design uses Function Points (which can be converted to Lines of Code).\nSchedule Management The goal here is simple: make sure the project finishes on time.\nPrinciples of Schedule Management Compartmentalization (Division) Interdependency Time Allocation Effort Validation Defined Responsibilities Defined Outcomes Defined Milestones Scheduling Methods Common visual tools include Gantt charts and PERT (Program Evaluation \u0026amp; Review Technique) charts.\nGantt Charts A Gantt chart is a horizontal bar chart that tracks tasks against a calendar. The horizontal axis is time (days, weeks, etc.), and tasks are listed vertically on the left. Each bar shows a task\u0026rsquo;s start, end, and duration. Overlapping bars indicate concurrent tasks.\nGantt charts are great for seeing when tasks start/stop and what\u0026rsquo;s running in parallel. However, they don\u0026rsquo;t show dependencies well and make it hard to spot the \u0026ldquo;critical path.\u0026rdquo;\nPERT Charts A PERT chart is a directed graph where arrows represent tasks (labeled with duration) and nodes represent events. A node (event) only happens when all incoming tasks are finished; only then can outgoing tasks start. Events don\u0026rsquo;t consume time; they are just points in time.\nEach event has an \u0026ldquo;earliest time\u0026rdquo; (when tasks can start) and a \u0026ldquo;latest time\u0026rdquo; (when tasks must start to avoid delays). The difference is \u0026ldquo;Slack Time.\u0026rdquo;\nPERT charts show dependencies and the critical path. They help identify which tasks can be delayed without hitting the final deadline. However, they aren\u0026rsquo;t great at showing parallelism at a glance.\nSoftware Configuration Management (SCM) SCM goals: Change identification, change control, version control, ensuring changes are implemented correctly, and change reporting.\nContent includes: Version management, configuration support, change support, process support, team support, reporting, and auditing.\nDatabases (Repositories) in SCM:\nDevelopment Library: For devs. Frequent changes, loose control. Controlled Library (Master Library): Stores baseline products at the end of a stage. This is where SCM happens. Product Library: Final products after system testing, ready for delivery or installation. Risk Management Software risk has two attributes: Uncertainty and Loss. Uncertainty means it might happen; Loss means it sucks if it does. You need to quantify both.\nProject Risks threaten the plan. If they happen, schedules slip and costs rise. Think budget, people, resources, and requirements issues.\nTechnical Risks threaten quality and delivery. If these hit, the work gets hard or impossible. Think design, implementation, and interface issues, or using \u0026ldquo;bleeding edge\u0026rdquo; tech that isn\u0026rsquo;t ready.\nBusiness Risks threaten the viability of the software. Top 5:\nMarket Risk: Building a great product nobody wants. Strategic Risk: Product doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit the company\u0026rsquo;s direction anymore. Sales Risk: Sales team doesn\u0026rsquo;t know how to sell it. Management Risk: Losing senior management support. Budget Risk: Losing funding or people. 1. Risk Identification This is about systematically spotting threats to the plan. Once you find known and predictable risks, you try to avoid them or control them.\nOne method is a Risk Item Checklist, focusing on:\nProduct Size: Risks related to the overall scale. Business Impact: Constraints from management or the market. Customer Characteristics: Customer sophistication and communication. Process Definition: How well the team follows the software process. Development Environment: Quality/availability of tools. Technology: Complexity and \u0026ldquo;newness\u0026rdquo; of the tech. Staff Talent/Experience: Skills and experience of the engineers. You can also categorize risks by Performance, Cost, Support, and Schedule.\n2. Risk Prediction (Estimation) This assesses two things: the probability it will happen and the consequences if it does.\n(1) Activities Define a scale for probability. Describe the consequences. Estimate the impact on the project/product. Note the overall accuracy of the prediction. A Risk Table is a simple tool here. List risks, categories, probability, and impact (1: Catastrophic, 2: Critical, 3: Marginal, 4: Negligible).\n(2) Assessing Impact Impact depends on Nature, Scope, and Timing.\nNature: The type of problem (e.g., bad hardware interface). Scope: How bad is it and how much of the project is affected? Timing: When does it hit and for how long? Risk Exposure (RE) calculation:\nRE = P × C Where P is probability and C is the cost if it happens. 3. Risk Assessment Uses a triplet:\n(Ri, li, xi) Where r is the risk, l is the probability, and x is the impact. You define Risk Referent Levels (usually cost, schedule, and performance). There\u0026rsquo;s a threshold where the project might be terminated if exceeded.\nSteps:\nDefine referent levels. Link each triplet to these levels. Predict termination points. Predict which combination of risks will trigger those points. 4. Risk Control The goal is to have a strategy.\n(1) Risk Mitigation (Avoidance) The best way to handle risk is to stop it before it starts. Example: Risk $r_i$ is \u0026ldquo;High Staff Turnover.\u0026rdquo; If $l_i$ is 70% and $x_i$ is 2 (Critical), you:\nDiscuss causes (pay, environment) with staff. Fix controllable causes before the project starts. Plan for continuity if someone leaves. Cross-train and share info across the team. Set standards so docs are always up to date. Peer review everything. (2) Risk Monitoring Watch for indicators that risk is increasing. For turnover, watch team morale, cohesion, and job market trends.\n(3) RMMM Plan All this goes into the Risk Mitigation, Monitoring, and Management (RMMM) plan. It documents the analysis and is used by the manager throughout the project.\nOnce the project starts, you monitor to see if risks happen, ensure mitigation steps are followed, and collect data for future projects. Often, one problem is caused by multiple risks, so tracking helps find the \u0026ldquo;root cause.\u0026rdquo;\n","date":"2023-04-02T06:58:00+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/100/","title":"Software Engineering - Software Project Management"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Software Engineering Series - Part 4\nSoftware maintenance is the final phase of the software lifecycle, occurring after the system hits production. Since it happens after deployment, it technically isn\u0026rsquo;t part of the system development process. It involves modifying software after delivery to fix bugs or meet new requirements—essentially any change made to the software once it\u0026rsquo;s live.\nSystem Maintainability Concepts System maintainability is defined as how easy it is for maintenance personnel to understand, correct, change, and improve the software. Improving maintainability is a key goal across all development steps. Whether a system can be maintained effectively is measured by the \u0026ldquo;system maintainability\u0026rdquo; metric.\nSystem Maintainability Metrics Understandability: How easily others can grasp the system\u0026rsquo;s structure, interfaces, functions, and internal processes. Modularity, detailed design docs, structured design, and high-level programming languages all help here. Testability: The ease of diagnosis and testing depends on understandability. Solid documentation is crucial for diagnosis, as are clear program structures, high-performance testing tools, and well-planned test procedures. Developers should design for diagnostic ease during the design and coding phases. Existing test cases from the system testing phase should be reused during maintenance. Modifiability: This is directly linked to design principles. Modularity, coupling, cohesion, and the relationship between scope of effect and scope of control all impact how easily a system can be modified. Maintenance and Software Documentation Documentation is the deciding factor in software maintainability. Large systems used over long periods undergo many changes, making docs vital.\nSoftware documentation falls into two categories:\nUser Documentation: Describes system functions and usage without worrying about implementation details. System Documentation: Describes design, implementation, testing, and other technical aspects. Maintainability is a core feature every software product should have. It must be addressed during the development phase. Every single stage of software engineering should consider and improve maintainability, with technical and management reviews at the end of each stage focusing on this metric.\nSoftware Documentation High-quality documentation improves software development quality.\nDocumentation is an integral part of the software; software without documentation isn\u0026rsquo;t really \u0026ldquo;software.\u0026rdquo; Documentation takes up a significant portion of the workload in development, and high-quality docs are essential for the software product\u0026rsquo;s long-term value.\nContent and Types of System Maintenance System maintenance includes hardware, software, and data maintenance.\nHardware Maintenance Handled by dedicated hardware maintenance personnel.\nSoftware Maintenance This involves modifying applications based on changing requirements or hardware environments. When modifying, source code should be fully utilized. All changes must be logged in a program modification registry, and differences between old and new versions must be specified in change notices.\nTypes of software maintenance include:\nCorrective Maintenance: Fixing errors that occurred during development but weren\u0026rsquo;t caught during testing. Adaptive Maintenance: Modifying software to keep up with changes in IT environments (hardware/OS) or management requirements. Perfective Maintenance: Adding new features or improving performance that wasn\u0026rsquo;t specified in the original system analysis and design. Preventive Maintenance: Proactively adding new features to improve reliability and maintainability, ensuring the system survives future environment changes without becoming obsolete. Data Maintenance Handled primarily by Database Administrators (DBAs), focusing on security, integrity, and concurrency control.\nSoftware Quality Attributes Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability are key quality attributes, usually measured on a scale of 0 to 1 in software engineering.\nReliability is the probability that a system operates without failure for a given time interval under specific conditions. It can be measured as MTTF / (1 + MTTF), where MTTF is Mean Time To Failure.\nAvailability is the probability that a system is operating correctly according to specs at a given point in time. It can be measured as MTBF / (1 + MTBF), where MTBF is Mean Time Between Failures.\nMaintainability is the probability that maintenance activities can be completed within a given time interval using specified processes and resources. It can be measured as 1 / (1 + MTTR), where MTTR is Mean Time To Repair.\n","date":"2023-03-31T07:57:00+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/99/","title":"Software Engineering - System Maintenance Overview"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Software Engineering Series - Article 3\nSignificance, Purpose, and Principles of System Testing System testing is the process of executing a program with the intent of finding errors. A successful test is one that uncovers a previously undiscovered error.\nThe goal is to find potential bugs and defects using minimum manpower and time. Users should design test cases based on requirements, design documents, or the internal structure of the program, and use these cases to run the program to find errors.\nInformation system testing includes software testing, hardware testing, and network testing. Hardware and network testing can be conducted based on specific performance indicators. Here, we focus primarily on software testing.\nSystem testing is critical for ensuring quality and reliability. It serves as the final review of system analysis, design, and implementation. Follow these basic principles:\nTest early and often. Testing shouldn\u0026rsquo;t wait until development is finished. Errors can creep in at any stage due to complexity or communication issues. Testing should be integrated throughout the lifecycle to catch and fix errors early. Avoid testing your own code. Developers often have a blind spot for their own work or subconsciously follow the same logic used during coding. Testing should be handled by an independent team for objectivity and effectiveness. Define expected outputs. When designing test scenarios, determine both the input data and the expected result. Comparing the actual output with the expected result is how you identify defects. Include invalid and unexpected inputs. Don\u0026rsquo;t just test \u0026ldquo;happy paths.\u0026rdquo; People tend to test correct scenarios and ignore abnormal or illogical inputs, which is often where hidden bugs reside. Check for unintended side effects. Test not only if the program does what it should do, but also ensure it doesn\u0026rsquo;t do what it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t. Extra, unintended functions can impact efficiency or cause potential harm. Stick to the plan. Avoid random testing. A test plan should include content, schedule, personnel, environment, tools, and data. This ensures the project stays on track and everything is coordinated. Save test documents. Keep test plans and test cases as part of the software documentation for easier maintenance. Design for re-use. Well-designed test cases make re-testing or incremental testing easier. When fixing bugs or adding features, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to re-run tests. Reusing or modifying existing cases is much more efficient. Testing objectives for the system testing phase are derived from the requirements analysis phase.\nTraditional Software Testing Strategies Effective software testing typically follows four steps: Unit Testing, Integration Testing, Validation (Confirmation) Testing, and System Testing.\n(1) Unit Testing Also known as module testing. It occurs after a module is written and compiles without errors. It focuses on internal logic and data structures. Usually performed using white-box testing. Multiple modules can be tested simultaneously.\n1. Content of Unit Testing Unit testing checks five main characteristics:\nModule Interface: Ensures data flows correctly in and out. Do input parameters and formal parameters match in count, type, and units? Do actual parameters match the formal parameters of called modules? Are standard function parameters correct? Are global variables consistent across modules? Does the input only change formal parameters? Are I/O formats consistent? Are files opened before use and closed after? Local Data Structures: Common source of errors. Are variable declarations appropriate? Are uninitialized variables used? Are default/initial values correct? Are there typos in variable names? Critical Execution Paths: Testing paths is fundamental. Since exhaustive testing is impossible, design cases to find math, comparison, or control flow errors. Math errors: Operator precedence, precision issues, incompatible types, algorithm flaws. Comparison/Control flow: Precision causing \u0026ldquo;equal\u0026rdquo; values to differ, comparing different types, incorrect logic operators, off-by-one errors in loops, infinite loops, or incorrect exit points. Error Handling: A good design predicts error conditions and has a path to handle them. Logic must be correct to allow for user maintenance. Boundary Conditions: Testing the edges of the software\u0026rsquo;s capabilities. Errors frequently occur at boundaries. 2. Unit Testing Process Since modules don\u0026rsquo;t run in isolation, you need two types of helper modules:\nDriver: Acts as a \u0026ldquo;main\u0026rdquo; program. It accepts test case data, passes it to the module under test, and prints results. Stub: Replaces sub-modules called by the module under test. It performs minimal data processing to verify the interface and return information. High module cohesion simplifies unit testing. If a module performs only one function, it requires fewer test cases and errors are easier to predict.\n(2) Integration Testing Integration testing combines modules according to the system design. Even if modules work individually, problems can arise when they interact.\nTwo main approaches: Non-incremental integration (Big Bang - test all at once) and Incremental integration (building and testing in small steps).\nCommon incremental strategies:\n1. Top-Down Integration Constructs the architecture starting from the main control module (main program) and moving down the hierarchy using depth-first or breadth-first search.\nThe main control module is the driver; stubs replace its subordinates. Replace stubs one by one with actual modules based on the chosen search method. Test after each integration. Perform regression testing to ensure no new bugs were introduced. Repeat until the structure is complete. Pros: No drivers needed. Cons: Requires writing stubs.\n2. Bottom-Up Integration Starts construction and testing with atomic modules (lowest level). Since subordinates are always available, stubs aren\u0026rsquo;t needed.\nCombine low-level modules into clusters that perform sub-functions. Write a driver to coordinate test inputs and outputs. Test the cluster. Remove the driver and move up the hierarchy. Pros: No stubs needed. Cons: Requires writing drivers.\n3. Regression Testing Every time a new module is added, the software changes. New data paths or control logic might break existing functionality. Regression testing re-executes a subset of previous tests to ensure changes haven\u0026rsquo;t introduced side effects.\nTests should include:\nRepresentative samples of all functions. Tests focused on components likely affected by the change. Tests focused on the changed components themselves. 4. Smoke Testing A frequent integration testing method for time-critical projects. It allows the team to assess the project status daily.\nTesting Methods Software testing involves specific methods and case designs within a sequence of steps. Methods are divided into static and dynamic testing.\nStatic Testing: Does not run the code. Uses manual inspection or computer-aided tools. Manual: Code reviews, static structure analysis, code quality metrics. Computer-Aided: Tools extract info to check for logic defects or suspicious constructs. Dynamic Testing: Running the program to find errors. Includes black-box and white-box testing. Test cases consist of input data and expected results. They must include both valid and invalid input conditions.\n(1) Black-Box Testing Also called functional testing. It treats the software as a \u0026ldquo;black box,\u0026rdquo; testing external behavior without looking at internal code or structure.\nTechniques include:\nEquivalence Partitioning: Divide input data into classes; test one representative from each class. Boundary Value Analysis: Focuses on the edges of input/output ranges, as errors often cluster there. Error Guessing: Based on experience and intuition about where bugs typically hide. Cause-Effect Graphing: Using logic diagrams to map inputs (causes) to outputs (effects) to create a decision table. (2) White-Box Testing Also called structural testing. It designs cases based on internal logic and structure to verify paths and design requirements.\nPrinciples:\nEvery independent path is executed at least once. Every logical decision is tested for both True and False outcomes. Loops are tested at boundaries and typical values. Internal data structure validity is verified. 1. Logic Coverage Measures how thoroughly the code logic is exercised:\nStatement Coverage: Every statement runs at least once (the weakest criteria). Decision (Branch) Coverage: Every decision evaluates to both True and False. Condition Coverage: Every logical condition in a decision takes on all possible values. Decision/Condition Coverage: Satisfies both Decision and Condition coverage. Condition Combination Coverage: Every possible combination of condition outcomes in a decision is tested. Path Coverage: Every possible execution path in the program is tested. 2. Loop Coverage Ensures every condition within a loop is verified.\n3. Basis Path Testing Derived from control flow graphs. It analyzes cyclomatic complexity to define a set of basic execution paths for test design.\nDebugging Debugging happens after testing. Its job is to find the cause and location of a bug and fix it.\nCommon methods:\n(1) Trial and Error (Brute Force) The developer guesses the problem location, inserts print statements, or checks memory/registers to find clues.\n(2) Backtracking Start from where the error was detected and trace the code backward through the control flow to find the root cause.\n(3) Binary Search (Partitioning) Isolate the error by checking variables at specific points. If a variable is correct at point A but wrong at point B, the error is between those points. Repeat to narrow the scope.\n(4) Induction Start with specific clues from the failed test, collect data, look for patterns, form a hypothesis, and prove or disprove it.\n(5) Deduction List all possible causes, use data to eliminate impossible or contradictory ones, pick the most likely cause, refine the hypothesis, and see if it explains all test results.\n","date":"2023-03-29T19:56:57+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/98/","title":"Software Engineering - System Testing"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash Software Engineering Series Article Two\nSoftware Life Cycle Feasibility Analysis and Project Development Plan Requirements Analysis High-Level Design Detailed Design Coding Testing Maintenance Software Requirements Before gathering requirements, clarify what needs to be collected, i.e., what requirements include. Software requirements are the user\u0026rsquo;s expectations for the target software system in terms of functionality, behavior, performance, design constraints, and so on.\nFunctional Requirements. Think about what the system needs to do, when, and how it will be modified or upgraded. Performance Requirements. Consider the technical metrics for software development. For example, storage capacity limits, execution speed, response time, and throughput. User or Human Factors. Think about user types. For example, users\u0026rsquo; computer proficiency, required training, difficulty in understanding/using the system, and the possibility of user errors. Environmental Requirements. Consider the future software application environment, including hardware and software. Hardware requirements include model, peripherals, interfaces, location, distribution, humidity, magnetic interference, etc.; software requirements include operating systems, networks, databases, etc. Interface Requirements. Consider inputs from other systems, outputs to other systems, specific rules for data formats, and regulations for data storage media. Documentation Requirements. Think about what documents are needed and who the target readers are. Data Requirements. Consider input/output data formats, data receiving/sending frequency, data accuracy and precision, data flow, and data retention period. Resource Usage Requirements. Think about resources needed during software runtime, such as data, other software, memory space; and resources needed for software development and maintenance, like personnel, support software, development equipment, etc. Security and Confidentiality Requirements. Consider whether access to the system or system information needs control, methods for isolating user data, how user programs are isolated from other programs and the OS, and system backup requirements, etc. Reliability Requirements. Consider system reliability requirements, whether the system must detect and isolate errors; and the allowable time to restart the system after an error. Software Cost and Development Schedule Requirements. Consider if development has a defined timeline, and if there are soft/hardware investment limitations, etc. Other Non-Functional Requirements. Such as adopting a specific development model, defining quality control standards, milestones, reviews, acceptance criteria, priority of various quality requirements, and maintainability requirements. System Design The main goal of system design is to blueprint the system. This means weighing pros and cons across various technologies and implementation methods, designing carefully, utilizing resources efficiently, and finally outlining the detailed design plan for the new system.\nHigh-Level Design Developers transform the identified functional requirements into the necessary system architecture.\n1. Designing the Overall Software System Structure The core task is to use a design method to break down a complex system into functional modules; define each module\u0026rsquo;s function; determine calling relationships between modules; define module interfaces, i.e., information passed between modules; and evaluate the quality of the module structure.\nDesigning the overall software system structure is a critical step in high-level design, directly impacting the detailed design and coding in the next phase. The quality and overall characteristics of the software system are determined during the design of its overall structure.\n2. Data Structure and Database Design (1) Data Structure Design The progressive refinement method also applies to data structure design. In the requirements analysis phase, data composition, operational constraints, and relationships between data were described via data dictionaries, defining the data\u0026rsquo;s structural characteristics. This needs refinement in the high-level design phase, with concrete implementation details specified in the detailed design phase. During high-level design, using abstract data types is recommended.\n(2) Database Design Database design refers to the design of data storage files, primarily involving these aspects:\nConceptual Design. Based on data analysis, a bottom-up approach is used for view design from the user\u0026rsquo;s perspective, typically using E-R models to represent the data model. The E-R model is fundamental for both database and data structure design. Logical Design. E-R models are DBMS-independent. The logical structure of the database must be built by considering the specific characteristics of the DBMS. Physical Design. Different DBMSs have different physical environments, storage structures, and access methods. Physical design involves detailing the physical aspects of the data schema, such as data item storage requirements, access methods, and index creation. 3. Writing High-Level Design Documentation The main documents include the High-Level Design Specification, Database Design Specification, User Manual, and Revised Test Plan.\n4. Review Each part of the design is reviewed for complete implementation of functional and performance requirements, feasibility of design methods, correctness and effectiveness of critical processing and internal/external interface definitions, and consistency between components.\nDetailed Design Perform detailed algorithm design for each module, using tools like diagrams, tables, and languages to describe the detailed algorithm for each module\u0026rsquo;s processing. Design the data structures within each module. Perform physical design for the database, i.e., determine the database\u0026rsquo;s physical structure. Other Designs. Depending on the type of software system, the following designs might also be needed: Code Design. To improve operations like data input, classification, storage, and retrieval, and to save memory space, certain data item values in the database require code design. Input/Output Format Design User Interface Design Write the Detailed Design Specification. Review. Both the processing algorithms and the database\u0026rsquo;s physical structure need to be reviewed. The result of system design is a series of system design documents. These documents form the crucial foundation for physically implementing an information system (including hardware setup and software programming).\n","date":"2023-03-29T17:04:45+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/97/","title":"Software Engineering - Requirements Analysis and System Design"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash Software Engineering Series Article One\nSoftware Process The roadmap followed during software development is called a \u0026ldquo;software process.\u0026rdquo;\nCapability Maturity Model (CMM) CMM divides software process improvement into the following 5 maturity levels:\nInitial\nSoftware is characterized by disorganization, sometimes even chaos. There are almost no clearly defined steps, and project completion relies entirely on individual efforts and the actions of heroic key figures.\nRepeatable\nBasic project management processes and practices are established to track project costs, schedules, and functional characteristics. Necessary process guidelines are in place to repeat previous successes on similar projects.\nDefined\nBoth management and engineering software processes are documented, standardized, and integrated into the organization\u0026rsquo;s standard software process. All projects use this standard software process, modified as needed, to develop and maintain software.\nManaged\nDetailed metrics for software process and product quality are defined. Both the software process and product quality are understood and controlled by members of the development organization.\nOptimized\nQuantitative analysis is enhanced. Feedback from process quality and new ideas/technologies allows for continuous process improvement.\nThe CMM model provides a framework that organizes the evolutionary steps of software process improvement into 5 maturity levels, laying a progressive foundation for continuous process improvement. These 5 maturity levels define an ordered scale to measure an organization\u0026rsquo;s software process maturity and evaluate its software process capability.\nCapability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) CMM\u0026rsquo;s success led to the derivation of models applicable to different disciplines. However, engineering often involves multiple cross-disciplines, making it necessary to integrate various process improvement efforts. CMMI is a synthesis and improvement of several process models.\nCMMI offers two representations: staged and continuous models.\n1. Staged Model The staged model\u0026rsquo;s structure is similar to CMM, focusing on organizational maturity. CMMI-SE/SW/IPPD version 1.1 has 5 maturity levels:\nInitial: Processes are unpredictable and lack control. Managed: Processes serve the project. Defined: Processes serve the organization. Quantitatively Managed: Processes are measured and controlled. Optimized: Focuses on process improvement. 2. Continuous Model The continuous model focuses on the capability of each process area. An organization can achieve different Process Area Capability Levels (CL) for different processes. CMMI includes 6 process area capability levels, numbered 0-5. Capability levels include common goals and related common practices, which are added to specific goals and practices within the process area. When an organization satisfies the specific and common goals of a process area, it is said to have achieved that process area\u0026rsquo;s capability level.\nCL0 (Incomplete): The process area is not performed or does not achieve all goals defined for CL1. CL1 (Performed): Its common goal is that the process transforms identifiable input work products into identifiable output work products to achieve the specific goals supporting the process area. CL2 (Managed): Its common goal focuses on institutionalizing managed processes. Based on organizational policies, it specifies which process operation will be used. Projects follow documented plans and process descriptions, all working personnel have access to sufficient resources, and all work tasks and products are monitored, controlled, and reviewed. CL3 (Defined): Its common goal focuses on institutionalizing defined processes. Processes are tailored from the organization\u0026rsquo;s standard process set according to organizational tailoring guidelines. Process assets and process measurements must also be collected and used for future process improvement. CL4 (Quantitatively Managed): Its common goal focuses on institutionalizing quantitatively managed processes. Measurements and quality assurance are used to control and improve process areas, and quantitative objectives for quality and process performance are established and used as management criteria. CL5 (Optimized): Quantitative (statistical) means are used to change and optimize process areas to meet evolving customer requirements and improve the effectiveness of process areas in continuous improvement plans. Software Process Models Software process models are also commonly known as software development models. They provide a structural framework for all processes, activities, and tasks in software development. Typical software process models include the Waterfall model, Incremental model, Evolutionary models (Prototype model, Spiral model), Fountain model, Component-Based Development model, and Formal Methods model.\nWaterfall Model The Waterfall model defines software lifecycle activities as several linearly connected stages, including requirements analysis, design, coding, testing, operation, and maintenance. It mandates a fixed, sequential order, flowing step-by-step like a waterfall.\nThe Waterfall model offers an effective management paradigm for software development and maintenance. Based on this model, development plans are made, cost budgets are set, development teams are organized, and the entire development process is guided effectively through phase reviews and document control. Therefore, it\u0026rsquo;s a document-driven model, suitable for software projects with very clear requirements.\nThe Waterfall model assumes that the requirements for a system under development are complete, concise, consistent, and can be fully defined before design and implementation begin.\nAdvantages of the Waterfall model include ease of understanding and low management costs. It emphasizes phased early planning, requirements gathering, and product testing. Disadvantages include: customers must be able to express their needs completely, correctly, and clearly; it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to assess the true progress status in the initial two or three phases; a large amount of integration and testing work emerges as the project nears completion; and the system\u0026rsquo;s capabilities cannot be demonstrated until the project\u0026rsquo;s end. In the Waterfall model, errors in requirements or design are often only discovered late in the project, leading to weaker project risk control. This often results in project delays and budget overruns.\nV-Model A variant of the Waterfall model is the V-Model.\nThe V-Model describes the relationship between quality assurance activities and communication, modeling-related activities, and early construction-related activities. As the software team progresses down the left side of the V-Model, fundamental problem requirements are progressively refined, forming technical descriptions of problems and solutions. Once coding is complete, the team moves up the right side of the V-Model, essentially performing a series of tests (quality assurance activities). These tests verify each model generated as the team moved down the left side of the V-Model. The V-Model provides a way to apply verification and validation activities early in software engineering.\nIncremental Model The Incremental model combines basic elements of the Waterfall model with the iterative features of prototyping. It assumes that requirements can be segmented into a series of incremental products, each of which can be developed separately. This model uses interleaved linear sequences that progress over time, with each linear sequence producing a releasable \u0026ldquo;increment\u0026rdquo; of the software.\nWhen using the Incremental model, the first increment is often the core product. Customer usage and evaluation of each increment serve as new features and functions for the next increment\u0026rsquo;s release. This process repeats after each increment\u0026rsquo;s release until the final, complete product is created. The Incremental model emphasizes that each increment delivers an operable product.\nAs a variant of the Waterfall model, the Incremental model possesses all of the Waterfall model\u0026rsquo;s advantages. Additionally, it offers these benefits: the first deliverable version requires little cost and time; the risk involved in developing small systems represented by increments is low; user requirement changes can be reduced due to the quick release of the first version; and incremental investment is possible, meaning that at the start of a project, one might only invest in one or two increments.\nThe Incremental model has the following drawbacks: if user change requests are not planned for, initial increments might cause instability in later ones; if requirements are not as stable and complete as initially thought, some increments might need re-development and re-release; and the complexity of managing costs, schedules, and configurations might exceed the organization\u0026rsquo;s capabilities.\nEvolutionary Models Software, like other complex systems, evolves over time. During development, teams often face scenarios where business and product requirements frequently change, making the final product difficult to realize; strict delivery timelines prevent development teams from fully completing a software product, yet a limited-functionality version must be delivered to meet competition or business pressure; or core product and system requirements are well understood, but detailed issues for product or system expansion remain undefined. In these and similar situations, software developers need a process model specifically designed to handle evolving software products.\nEvolutionary models are iterative process models that enable software developers to gradually develop more complete software versions. They are particularly suitable when there\u0026rsquo;s a lack of accurate understanding of software requirements. Typical evolutionary models include the Prototype model and the Spiral model.\nPrototype Model Not all requirements can be defined upfront. Extensive practice shows that it\u0026rsquo;s often hard to get a complete, accurate requirements specification early in development. This is mainly because clients often can\u0026rsquo;t precisely articulate all their future system needs, and developers may have a vague understanding of the application problem to be solved, leading to specifications that are frequently incomplete, inaccurate, or even ambiguous. Furthermore, users might generate new requirements throughout the development process, causing changes. Since the Waterfall model struggles with such requirement uncertainty and flux, a new development method called Rapid Prototype emerged. The prototyping approach is well-suited for situations with unclear or frequently changing user requirements. It\u0026rsquo;s often a good choice when the system size is not too large or overly complex.\nA prototype is an executable version of the intended system, reflecting a selected subset of its properties. A prototype doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to meet all constraints of the target software; its goal is quick, low-cost construction. Of course, the ability to use prototyping comes from the rapid advancement of development tools, allowing for the quick creation of a tangible system framework for users. This way, users less familiar with computers can propose their requirements based on this framework. Developing a prototype system first involves defining user requirements, developing an initial prototype, then soliciting user feedback for improvements on the initial prototype, and modifying the prototype based on that feedback.\nThe Prototype model starts with communication, aiming to define overall software goals and identify requirements. Then, a plan for prototype development is quickly formulated, defining the prototype\u0026rsquo;s objectives and scope. It\u0026rsquo;s modeled using rapid design and then constructed. The developed prototype should be delivered to the client for use, and client feedback is collected. This feedback can then be used to refine the prototype in the next iteration. When the previous prototype needs improvement or its scope needs to be expanded, the next round of iterative prototype development begins.\nSpiral Model For complex, large-scale software, developing a single prototype often falls short. The Spiral model combines the Waterfall and Evolutionary models, incorporating risk analysis, which both earlier models largely overlooked, thus compensating for their shortcomings.\nThe Spiral model divides the development process into several \u0026lsquo;spiral cycles,\u0026rsquo; each roughly aligning with the Waterfall model. Each spiral cycle consists of the following 4 steps:\nPlanning. Define software objectives, select implementation alternatives, and clarify project development constraints. Risk Analysis. Analyze selected alternatives, identify risks, and eliminate them. Engineering. Implement software development and verify phase-specific products. Customer Evaluation. Evaluate development work, propose corrections, and establish the development plan for the next cycle. The Spiral model emphasizes risk analysis, enabling developers and users to understand the risks emerging at each evolutionary layer and respond accordingly. Thus, this model is particularly suited for large, complex, and high-risk systems.\nCompared to the Waterfall model, the Spiral model supports dynamic changes in user requirements, facilitates user involvement in all key software development decisions, helps improve software adaptability, and provides convenience for project managers to adjust management decisions in a timely manner, thereby reducing software development risks. When using the Spiral model for software development, developers need considerable experience and expertise in risk assessment. Additionally, too many iterations can increase development costs and delay submission times.\nFountain Model The Fountain model is a user-requirement-driven and object-driven model, suitable for object-oriented development methods. It overcomes the Waterfall model\u0026rsquo;s limitations in not supporting software reuse and integration of multiple development activities. The Fountain model makes the development process iterative and seamless.\nIteration means that development activities in the model often need to be repeated multiple times, continuously refining the software system during the iterative process. \u0026lsquo;Seamless\u0026rsquo; refers to the absence of clear boundaries between development activities (like analysis, design, coding). That is, unlike the Waterfall model where design begins only after requirements analysis, and coding only after design, the Fountain model allows development activities to overlap and iterate.\nThe Fountain model\u0026rsquo;s stages have no distinct boundaries, allowing developers to work concurrently. Its advantage is improved software project development efficiency and reduced development time. However, because the Fountain model\u0026rsquo;s development stages overlap, it requires a large number of developers during the process, which can complicate project management. Additionally, this model demands strict document management, increasing auditing difficulty.\nUnified Process (UP) Model The Unified Process model is a \u0026ldquo;use-case and risk-driven, architecture-centric, iterative, and incremental\u0026rdquo; development process, supported by UML methods and tools. Iteration means dividing the entire software development project into many small \u0026ldquo;mini-projects,\u0026rdquo; each containing all elements of a normal software project: planning, analysis and design, construction, integration and testing, and internal and external release.\nThe Unified Process defines 4 technical phases and their artifacts:\nInception Phase\nThe Inception phase focuses on project startup activities. Key work products include the Vision Document, initial use-case model, initial project glossary, initial business use cases, initial risk assessment, project plan (phases and iterations), business model, and one or more prototypes (if needed).\nElaboration Phase\nThe Elaboration phase conducts requirements analysis and architectural evolution after understanding the initial domain scope. Key work products include the use-case model, supplementary requirements, analysis model, software architecture description, etc.\nConstruction Phase\nThe Construction phase focuses on system building, producing the implementation model. Key work products include the design model, software components, integrated software increments, test plans and procedures, test cases, and supporting documentation.\nTransition Phase\nThe Transition phase focuses on software delivery work, producing software increments. Key work products include the delivered software increment, beta test reports, and integrated user feedback.\nEach iteration produces a baseline including a partially complete version of the final system and any associated project documentation. Baselines are gradually built upon each other through successive iterations until the final system is complete. Each iteration has 5 core workflows:\nRequirements workflow to capture what the system should do. Analysis workflow to elaborate and structure requirements. Design workflow to realize requirements within the system architecture. Implementation workflow to construct the software. Test workflow to verify if the implementation works as expected. As UP phases progress, the effort for each core workflow changes. The 4 technical phases are terminated by major milestones:\nInception Phase: Lifecycle Objective Elaboration Phase: Lifecycle Architecture Construction Phase: Initial Operational Capability Transition Phase: Product Release A typical representative of the Unified Process is RUP (Rational Unified Process). RUP is a commercial extension of UP, fully compatible with UP, but more complete and detailed.\nAgile Methods The overall goal of Agile development is to satisfy customers through \u0026ldquo;early and continuous delivery of valuable software.\u0026rdquo; By introducing flexibility into the software development process, Agile methods allow users to add or change requirements later in the development cycle.\nThere are many typical Agile process methods, each based on a set of principles that embody the philosophy proclaimed by Agile methods (the Agile Manifesto).\n1. Extreme Programming (XP) XP is a lightweight (agile), efficient, low-cost, flexible, predictable, and scientific software development approach. It consists of 4 interrelated parts—values, principles, practices, and activities—which are interconnected and permeate the entire lifecycle through activities.\n4 Core Values: Communication, Simplicity, Feedback, and Courage. 5 Core Principles: Rapid Feedback, Assumed Simplicity, Incremental Change, Embracing Change, and Quality Work. 12 Key Practices: The Planning Game (quickly formulate plans, refine as details evolve). Small Releases (design systems for the earliest possible delivery). Metaphor (find appropriate metaphors to convey information). Simple Design (address only current requirements, keep designs simple). Test-Driven Development (write tests first, then write the code). Refactoring (re-examine requirements and designs, explicitly re-describe them to align with new and existing needs). Pair Programming. Collective Code Ownership. Continuous Integration (provide runnable versions to customers daily, even hourly). 40-Hour Week (work 40 hours per week). On-Site Customer (an end-user representative should collaborate full-time with the XP team). Coding Standards. 2. Crystal Methods Crystal Methods posit that every different project requires a unique set of strategies, conventions, and methodologies.\nIt believes people significantly impact software quality, so as project quality and developer skills improve, so do project and process quality. Improved communication and frequent deliveries boost software productivity.\n3. Scrum Scrum uses an iterative approach, where each 30-day iteration is called a \u0026ldquo;sprint,\u0026rdquo; and products are implemented according to requirement priorities. Multiple self-organizing and autonomous teams incrementally implement the product in parallel. Coordination happens through brief daily stand-up meetings, much like a rugby \u0026ldquo;scrum.\u0026rdquo; The steps are as follows:\n4. Adaptive Software Development (ASD) ASD has 6 core principles:\nGuided by a mission. Features are viewed as key points of customer value. Waiting in the process is important; thus, \u0026ldquo;rework\u0026rdquo; is as crucial as \u0026ldquo;doing.\u0026rdquo; Change is not seen as correction but as an adjustment to the realities of software development. Fixed delivery times compel developers to carefully consider key requirements for each produced version. Risk is inherent. 5. Agile Unified Process (AUP) The Agile Unified Process (AUP) uses the principles of \u0026ldquo;continuous on the large scale\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;iterative on the small scale\u0026rdquo; to build software systems. It adopts the classic UP phased activities (Inception, Elaboration, Construction, and Transition), providing a series of activities that enable teams to conceptualize a comprehensive process flow for software projects. Within each activity, a team iteratively uses Agile practices and delivers meaningful software increments to end-users as quickly as possible. Each AUP iteration performs the following activities:\nModeling. Create model representations of the business and problem domain, models that are \u0026ldquo;good enough\u0026rdquo; for the team to move forward. Implementation. Translate models into source code. Testing. Like XP, the team designs and executes a series of tests to find errors and ensure the source code meets requirements. Deployment. Deliver software increments and obtain end-user feedback. Configuration and Project Management. Focus on change management, risk management, and control over any of the team\u0026rsquo;s artifacts. Project management tracks and controls the development team\u0026rsquo;s progress and coordinates team activities. Environment Management. Coordinate process infrastructure such as standards, tools, and supporting technologies applicable to the development team.

In this case, use SSH:\n1 git clone git@github.com:yexca/typecho-theme-book.git Usually, it\u0026rsquo;s better to fork the repo, make changes, and then submit a Pull Request.\nReferences: How to give tea to the big shots using GitHub - idealclover How to make your first pull request on GitHub Cloning your own repo First, add your SSH public key in your personal settings: SSH and GPG keys (github.com) Then, either method works.\n4. Committing Files Locally After making changes, it\u0026rsquo;s time to commit.\nAdd files to the staging area:\n1 2 3 git add filename # Or to add all modified files git add . Commit the staged files:\n1 git commit -m \u0026#34;some details\u0026#34; Describe your changes in some details.\nWhat if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to track certain files?\nCreate a .gitignore file and list the filenames (one per line).\n1 2 3 4 5 # .gitignore file test/ # Ignore the test folder test # Ignore the test file *.py[cod] # Ignore *.pyc *.pyo *.pyd files !app.pyc # Do NOT ignore app.pyc You can force a commit of an ignored file with git add -f test.pyc.\nCheck out ready-made templates here: https://github.com/github/gitignore If you need to modify .gitignore after files are already tracked, clear the cache first:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 # Clear cache git rm -r --cached . # Re-add files git add . # Commit git commit -m \u0026#34;update .gitignore\u0026#34; 5. Logs and Undoing Changes Check the repo status: git status\nView changes since last commit: git diff\nView history: git log. Use --pretty=oneline to condense it and see commit IDs.\nThe latest commit is marked as HEAD -\u0026gt; master (the current version). Git uses HEAD for current, HEAD^ for the previous, and HEAD~60 for 60 versions back.\nRoll back to the previous version: git reset --hard HEAD^\nRoll back to a specific version:\n1 2 3 4 git reset --hard commitID # For example, if commit ID is eaadf4e385e865d25c48e7ca9c8395c3f7dfaef0: git reset --hard eaadf4 # Just the first few unique digits are enough. If you messed up a rollback, don\u0026rsquo;t close the terminal. Run git reflog to find your previous commit ID and jump back.\n6. Linking Local Repo to GitHub To upload a local repo to GitHub, create a new repo on GitHub and link it:\n1 git remote add origin git@github.com:[your repo] (Not needed if you cloned the repo).\nTo push local changes to the remote: git push origin master\nNote: VS Code defaults to master as the branch name, while GitHub defaults to main. Pushing to main directly might fail. You can rename your local branch:\n1 git branch -m master main Or set the global default to main:\n1 git config --global init.defaultBranch main Set the default upstream for your branch:\n1 git push --set-upstream origin main After this, you can just use git push origin.\nIf you made a mistake while linking:\nCheck remote info: git remote -v\nRemove the remote: git remote rm RepoName (usually git remote rm origin).\n7. Branch Management Branches let you work on features or fixes without affecting the main code.\nList branches: git branch\nCreate branch: git branch new_branch\nSwitch branch: git checkout new_branch or git switch new_branch\nPush to a specific branch: git push origin branch_name\nExample: Adding a search feature\nCreate and switch to the search branch:\n1 git switch -c search Commit changes on the search branch:\n1 2 git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;Add search feature\u0026#34; Switch back to main:\n1 git switch main Merge the search branch:\n1 git merge search (Optional) Delete the search branch:\n1 git branch -d search 8.

I put the elephant inside. I close the refrigerator door. Object-Oriented Approach This approach focuses on who should do what. You call operations on objects to achieve functionality.\nFor the elephant problem:\nCreate objects: Elephant, Refrigerator.\nRefrigerator opens door. Elephant gets into refrigerator. Refrigerator closes door. Object-Oriented Fundamentals Object-Oriented = Objects + Classification + Inheritance + Communication via Messages.\nIf your software system uses these four concepts, it\u0026rsquo;s object-oriented.\nObjects The real world consists of many concrete things, events, concepts, and rules. All of these can be viewed as objects.\nIn OO systems, an object is the fundamental runtime entity. It encapsulates both data (attributes) and operations (behaviors) that act on that data. An object typically has three parts: an object name, attributes, and methods.\nMessages A message is a construct for communication between objects. When a message is sent to an object, it contains information asking the receiving object to perform certain activities. The receiving object interprets the message and then responds.\nThink of it like passing arguments in a method call.\nClasses A class defines a group of generally similar objects. The methods and data within a class describe the common behaviors and attributes of a group of objects. Abstracting and storing common characteristics of objects in a class is a key aspect of OO technology. Whether a rich class library has been built is a significant indicator of an object-oriented programming language\u0026rsquo;s maturity.\nA class is an abstraction above objects, and an object is a concrete realization or instance of a class. During analysis and design, we usually focus on classes rather than specific objects. You don\u0026rsquo;t define each object individually; instead, you define the class, and then assign different values to its attributes to get object instances of that class.\nClasses can be categorized into three types: entity classes, interface classes (boundary classes), and control classes. Control class objects manage activity flows, acting as coordinators.\nSome classes have a general-special relationship: some classes are special cases of another class, and one class is a general case for others. A special class is a subclass of a general class, and a general class is a superclass of a special class.\nOften, a class and all its objects are referred to as \u0026ldquo;classes and objects\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;object classes.\u0026rdquo;\nMethod Overloading Method overloading forms:\nSame method name, different number of parameters. Same method name, different parameter types. Same method name, different parameter type order. Taking Java as an example, the format for a Java function (method) is as follows:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 /* Access Modifier Return Type MethodName(ParameterType1 ParameterName1, ParameterType2 ParameterName2,...) { Method Body } */ Here\u0026rsquo;s an example:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 public class Test { // Original method public void sum(int a, double b) { System.out.println(a + b); } // 1. Same method name, different number of parameters public void sum(int a, double b, int c) { System.out.println(a + b + c); } // 2. Same method name, different parameter types public void sum(int a, int b) { System.out.println(a + b); } // 3. Same method name, different parameter type order public void sum(double a, int b) { System.out.println(a + b); } } The Three Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming The three fundamental characteristics of object-oriented programming are: Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.\nEncapsulation Encapsulation is an information-hiding technique. Its goal is to separate the user of an object from its producer, and to decouple an object\u0026rsquo;s definition from its implementation. From a programmer\u0026rsquo;s perspective, an object is a program module; from a user\u0026rsquo;s perspective, an object provides the desired behavior.\nEssentially, it\u0026rsquo;s about packaging real-world entities into abstract classes. A class can then allow only trusted classes or objects to operate on its data and methods, hiding information from untrusted ones.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 public class Person{ private String name;\t// Uses private to restrict access private int age; public void setName(String name){ // Provides a way to modify object attributes via public methods this.name = name; } public String getName(){ // Provides a way to get object attributes via public methods return name; } public void setAge(int age){ if (age \u0026gt;= 0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; age \u0026lt;= 150) this.age = age; } public int getAge(){ return age; // Fixed typo } public void run(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;Run!\u0026#34;); // Fixed typo and translated } } Inheritance Inheritance is the mechanism by which parent and child classes share data and methods. It\u0026rsquo;s a relationship between classes where, when defining and implementing a class, you can build upon an existing parent class, using its defined content as your own, and adding new content.\nA parent class can have multiple child classes, all of which are special cases of the parent. The parent class describes their common attributes and methods. A child class can inherit attributes and methods from its parent (or ancestor) class; these don\u0026rsquo;t need to be defined in the child class, which can also define its own attributes and methods.\nIf a child class inherits from only one parent, it\u0026rsquo;s called \u0026ldquo;single inheritance.\u0026rdquo; If a child class has two or more parent classes, it\u0026rsquo;s called \u0026ldquo;multiple inheritance.\u0026rdquo;\nNote: In Java, a child class can only have one parent class.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 // Continuing from the previous code block public class Student extends Person{ // Uses the \u0026#39;extends\u0026#39; keyword to specify the parent class to inherit from private int id; public void setId(int id){ this.id = id; } public int getId(){ return id; } public void study(){ System.out.println(getName() + \u0026#34; is studying\u0026#34;); // Translated } // Overriding parent method public void run(){ System.out.println(getName() + \u0026#34; wants to run\u0026#34;); // Fixed typo and translated } } Polymorphism When an object receives a message, it responds. Different objects receiving the same message can produce entirely different results; this phenomenon is called polymorphism. With polymorphism, users can send a general message, and the specific implementation details are determined by the receiving object. This way, the same message can invoke different methods.\nPolymorphism is supported by inheritance. By leveraging the hierarchical relationships of classes, messages with common functionality are placed at higher levels, while the different behaviors that implement this functionality are placed at lower levels. Objects created at these lower levels can then respond differently to the common message.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 // Parent class public class Person{ public void work(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;working\u0026#34;); // Translated } } // Child class 1 public class Student extends Person{ // Overriding parent method public void work(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;going to school\u0026#34;); // Translated } public void run(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;Only the young CAN RUN!\u0026#34;); } } // Child class 2 public class Worker extends Person{ // Overriding parent method public void work(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;going to work\u0026#34;); // Translated } public void sleep(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;sleeping\u0026#34;); // Translated } } // main public class main{ public static void main(String[] args){ // Compile-time type on the left, runtime object on the right Person stu = new Student(); stu.work(); // Fixed typo // Cannot call stu.run() method Person wok = new Worker(); wok.work(); // Fixed typo // Cannot call wok.sleep() method } } // Runtime output: // going to school // going to work Forms of Polymorphism Polymorphism comes in different forms. Cardelli and Wegner categorized it into four types:\nParametric Polymorphism: Widely applied, often called the purest form of polymorphism.\nInclusion Polymorphism: Found in many languages, the most common example is subtyping, where one type is a subtype of another.\nOverload Polymorphism: The same name represents different meanings in different contexts.\nDynamic vs. Static Binding Binding is the process of linking a procedure call to the code executed in response to that call. In typical programming languages, binding occurs at compile time, known as static binding. Dynamic binding, however, happens at runtime. Thus, a given procedure call isn\u0026rsquo;t linked to its code until the call actually occurs.\nDynamic binding is tied to class inheritance and polymorphism. In an inheritance hierarchy, a child class is a special case of its parent, meaning a child object can appear wherever a parent object is expected. Therefore, during runtime, when an object sends a message requesting a service, the requested operation is linked to the implementing method based on the specific type of the receiving object – this is dynamic linking.\nObject-Oriented Analysis The goal of Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA) is to gain an understanding of the application problem. This understanding aims to define the system\u0026rsquo;s functional and performance requirements.\nObject-Oriented Analysis involves 5 activities: identifying objects, organizing objects, describing object interactions, defining object operations, and defining internal object information.\nObject-Oriented Design Object-Oriented Design (OOD) transforms the analysis model created during OOA into a design model, aiming to define the system\u0026rsquo;s construction blueprint. Typically, when an analysis model generated from a conceptual model is deployed into its corresponding execution environment, implementation issues need consideration, leading to adjustments and additions (e.g., modifying class structure based on whether the programming language supports multiple inheritance or inheritance in general). There\u0026rsquo;s no chasm between OOA and OOD; they use consistent concepts and notations. OOD also adheres to design principles like abstraction, information hiding, functional independence, and modularity.\nObject-Oriented Design Activities Building upon the OOA model, OOD includes the following five corresponding activities:\nIdentify Classes and Objects Define Attributes Define Services Identify Relationships Identify Packages Object-Oriented Design Principles Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) A class should have only one reason to change. That is, when a class needs modification, there should be only one specific reason for it. A class should handle only one type of responsibility.\nOpen/Closed Principle (OCP) Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.\nLiskov Substitution Principle (LSP) Subtypes must be substitutable for their base (parent) types. This means that anywhere a parent class appears, an instance of its child class can be assigned to the parent type\u0026rsquo;s reference. An \u0026lsquo;is-a\u0026rsquo; relationship truly exists only when an instance of a subtype can replace any instance of its supertype.\nDependency Inversion Principle (DIP) Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions. That is, high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.\nInterface Segregation Principle (ISP) Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use. Interfaces belong to clients, not to the class hierarchy they\u0026rsquo;re part of. Essentially: depend on abstractions, not concretions. Also, at the abstraction level, there should be no dependence on details. The benefit of this is maximizing adaptability to potential changes.\nThese are the five main principles in object-oriented methodology. In addition to these five, Robert C. Martin proposed several other object-oriented design principles:\nRelease Reuse Equivalency Principle (REP) The granule of reuse is the granule of release.\nCommon Closure Principle (CCP) All classes in a package should be closed together against the same kinds of changes. If a change affects a package, it should affect all classes within that package, but no other packages.\nCommon Reuse Principle (CRP) All classes in a package should be reused together. If you reuse one class from a package, you should reuse all classes from that package.\nAcyclic Dependencies Principle (ADP) The package dependency graph must not contain cycles. That is, the structure between packages must be a directed acyclic graph.\nStable Dependencies Principle (SDP) Depend in the direction of stability.\nStable Abstractions Principle (SAP) The abstractness of a package should be proportional to its stability.\nObject-Oriented Testing As for testing, systems developed with an object-oriented approach are tested no differently from systems developed with other methods.\nGenerally, testing for object-oriented software can be conducted at the following four levels:\nAlgorithm Layer Class Layer Template Layer System Layer Object-Oriented Programming A Programming Paradigm is the fundamental style or model people adopt when designing programs. It dictates the mindset and tools used during programming and has a specific scope of application. Its evolution has moved from procedural programming, modular programming, functional programming, and logic programming, to the current object-oriented programming paradigm.\nThe essence of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is using an Object-Oriented Programming Language (OOPL) and applying objects, classes, and related concepts in programming. Its key lies in the addition of classes and inheritance, which further enhances the level of abstraction. Specific OOP concepts are generally manifested through particular language mechanisms within an OOPL.\nOOP has now expanded into the realm of system analysis and software design, leading to the concepts of Object-Oriented Analysis and Object-Oriented Design, which we\u0026rsquo;ve touched upon earlier.\n","date":"2023-02-25T19:34:30+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/93/","title":"Object-Oriented Basics"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash SQL Series\nDatabase Study One: Introduction to Databases: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/86 Database Study Two: Relational Model: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/87 Database Study Three: SQL Language: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/88 Database Study Four: Relational Database Theory: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/89 Database Study Five: Normal Forms: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/90 Database Study Six: Database Design: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/91 Database Study Seven: Database Control Functions: This Article\nTransaction Management A transaction is a sequence of operations that are \u0026ldquo;all or nothing.\u0026rdquo;\nTransactions and programs are distinct concepts. Typically, a program can include multiple transactions.\nIn SQL, these three statements define transactions:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 -- Start transaction BEGIN TRANSACTION -- Commit transaction COMMIT -- Rollback transaction ROLLBACK Transactions have ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.\n1 Atomicity Transactions are atomic; they\u0026rsquo;re all or nothing.\n2 Consistency A transaction\u0026rsquo;s execution must ensure the database transitions from one consistent state to another.\nThus, a database is consistent when it only contains results from successfully committed transactions.\n3 Isolation Transactions are isolated from each other.\nWhen multiple transactions run concurrently, one transaction\u0026rsquo;s updates are invisible to others until it successfully commits.\n4 Durability Once a transaction successfully commits, its updates to the database are permanent, even if the database crashes.\nDatabase Backup and Recovery During database operation, hardware and software failures are inevitable. These can affect data correctness, even corrupting the database and causing partial or complete data loss. Hence, a key database technique is creating redundant data, i.e., backups. Database recovery technology focuses on promptly restoring the database to its correct pre-failure state after a system fault.\nFailure Types 4 types of failures in databases:\n1 Internal Transaction Failure Uses REDO and UNDO techniques.\n2 System Failure (DBMS) System abruptly halts, requiring a restart.\n3 Media Failure Hardware damage.\n4 Computer Virus Backup Methods The basic principle of recovery is \u0026ldquo;establishing data redundancy\u0026rdquo; (duplicate storage). Methods for creating redundant data include data dumping and logging. Data dumping is categorized into static/dynamic dumps, full/incremental dumps, and log files.\n1 Static and Dynamic Dumps Static dumps mean no access or modification operations are allowed on the database during the dump.\nDynamic dumps allow database access and modification during the dump.\nSo, dumps and user transactions can execute concurrently.\n2 Full and Incremental Dumps Full dumps involve dumping all data each time.\nIncremental dumps only dump data updated since the last dump.\n3 Log Files During transaction processing, the DBMS (Database Management System) writes every operation (transaction start, end, inserts, deletes, and modifications) to a log file. Should a failure occur, the DBMS recovery subsystem uses the log file to undo transaction changes, reverting to the transaction\u0026rsquo;s initial state. Thus, the DBMS uses log files for transaction and system failure recovery, and aids backup copies in media failure recovery.\nRecovery Transaction recovery involves 3 steps: Scan the log file in reverse (from end to beginning) to find the transaction\u0026rsquo;s update operations. Perform inverse operations for the transaction\u0026rsquo;s updates. Continue scanning the log file in reverse for other transaction updates, applying the same process until the transaction\u0026rsquo;s start flag. That is, if a transaction abnormally terminates, all previous operations are undone.\nSystem Failure Recovery UNDO incomplete transactions, REDO lost transactions.\nMedia Failure Recovery Reload the database, REDO completed transactions.\nConcurrency Control Issues with Concurrent Operations 1 Lost Updates My changes don\u0026rsquo;t stick. For example, I change the website logo, but it reverts to the old one.\n2 Non-Repeatable Reads Within a single transaction, I read different data twice in a row. Say I initially read a bank balance of $10. Then, my company deposits $100. The second read becomes $110.\n3 Dirty Reads I want to read fields A and B, but another user is updating them as I read. If I read halfway through their update (A is updated, B is being updated), the data I read is \u0026lsquo;dirty data\u0026rsquo;.\nConcurrency Control Techniques The primary technique for concurrency control is locking. Basic lock types include exclusive locks (X-locks or write locks) and shared locks (S-locks or read locks).\n1 Exclusive Lock (X-Lock) If transaction T acquires an X-lock on data object A, only T can read and modify A. No other transaction can place any type of lock on A until T releases its lock.\n2 Shared Lock (S-Lock) If transaction T acquires an S-lock on data object A, only T can read A, but not modify it. Other transactions can only place S-locks on A until T releases its S-lock. This ensures other transactions can read A, but cannot modify it until T releases its S-lock.\nLocking Protocols Level 1 Locking Protocol (Solves Lost Updates) When modifying, an X-lock must be acquired until completion.\nLevel 2 Locking Protocol (Solves Dirty Reads) When reading, an S-lock is acquired and released immediately after use.\nLevel 3 Locking Protocol (Solves Non-Repeatable Reads) When reading, an S-lock is acquired and held until completion.\nSerializability Serializability: If multiple concurrent executions yield a result that matches any possible serial execution, then it\u0026rsquo;s serializable.\nTransaction T1: Read B, A=B+1, Write A Transaction T2: Read A, B=A+1, Write B\nIf T1 runs first, then T2, the result is A=4, B=3; If T2 runs first, then T1, the result is A=3, B=4. This concurrent execution satisfies serializability.\nDistributed Databases Fragmentation Transparency Users or applications don\u0026rsquo;t need to know how a logically accessed table is physically fragmented and stored.\nReplication Transparency With replication, users don\u0026rsquo;t need to know which nodes data is replicated to, or how.\nLocation Transparency Users don\u0026rsquo;t need to know the physical location where data is stored.\nLogical Transparency Users or applications don\u0026rsquo;t need to know which data model is used at a local site.\nData Sharing Data stored across different nodes is shared.\nAutonomy Each node can manage its local data independently.\nAvailability If one site fails, the system can use replicas from other sites, preventing a total system shutdown.\nDistribution Data is stored across different sites.\n","date":"2023-02-12T08:15:00+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/92/","title":"Database Study Seven: Database Control Functions"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview SQL Series\nDatabase Learning 1: Introduction to Databases: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/86 Database Learning 2: Relational Model: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/87 Database Learning 3: SQL Language: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/88 Database Learning 4: Relational Database Theory: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/89 Database Learning 5: Normalization: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/90 Database Learning 6: Database Design: This article\nDatabase Learning 7: Database Control Functions: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/92 Database Design Strategies Top-down and bottom-up; usually a combination of both is used.\nDatabase Design Steps The \u0026ldquo;New Orleans Method\u0026rdquo; is currently the most recognized and authoritative method for database design.

Physical Design: Determine the specific implementation of the logical model on a computer. This is followed by the database implementation phase and the operation/maintenance phase.\nRequirement Analysis Phase Requirement analysis happens after the project is confirmed. Users and designers organize and describe the content (data) and functions (behavior) the database system will involve. It views the system from the user\u0026rsquo;s perspective.\nThis process is the foundation for everything that follows. Logical design, physical design, and application design are all based on this phase.\nTasks in the Requirement Analysis Phase: Investigate the organization → Familiarize with business activities → Clarify user requirements → Determine system boundaries → Analyze system functions → Analyze system data → Write the analysis report.\nDocuments in the Requirement Analysis Phase: Data collected during investigation might be fragmented. Analysts and designers must further analyze and express user needs by creating Requirement Specifications, Data Dictionaries, and Data Flow Diagrams (DFD).\nE-R Model The E-R (Entity-Relationship) model is a conceptual model used to describe the real world.\nEntity Represented by rectangles. The entity name is written inside the rectangle.\nRelationship Represented by diamonds. The relationship name is written inside the diamond, connected to related entities with undirected edges. The relationship type (1:1, 1:n, m:n) is marked next to the edges.\n\u0026lt;1\u0026gt; Relationships between two different entities:\nOne-to-One (1:1): An entity in entity set E1 is associated with at most one entity in entity set E2. One-to-Many (1:n): An entity in entity set E1 can be associated with multiple entities in entity set E2. Many-to-Many (m:n): Multiple entities in entity set E1 can be associated with multiple entities in entity set E2. \u0026lt;2\u0026gt; Relationships between more than two entity sets:\nThere can be 1:1:1, 1:1:n, 1:m:n, and r:n:m relationships between three or more different entity sets.\n\u0026lt;3\u0026gt; Binary relationships within the same entity set:\n1:1, 1:n, and m:n relationships can also exist between entities within the same entity set.\nAttribute Attributes are characteristics of an entity, represented by ovals. The attribute name is written inside (primary attributes are underlined) and connected to the entity with an undirected edge.\nEach attribute has a value range (domain). In the same entity set, the attributes and their domains are the same for each entity, but they may take different values.\nAttributes in the E-R model are categorized as follows:\nSimple and Composite Attributes Simple attributes are atomic and cannot be subdivided. Composite attributes can be broken down into smaller parts (i.e., other attributes). Unless specified, \u0026ldquo;attribute\u0026rdquo; usually refers to a simple one.\nSingle-valued and Multi-valued Attributes A single-valued attribute has only one value for a specific entity. A multi-valued attribute can have multiple values for a single entity.\nNULL Attributes When an entity has no value for an attribute or the value is unknown, a NULL value is used (meaning \u0026ldquo;not applicable\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;unknown\u0026rdquo;).\nDerived Attributes Derived attributes are calculated from other attributes. For example, if an employee has Hire Date and Years of Service, the Years of Service can be derived from the difference between the current date and the Hire Date.\nWeak Entity In the real world, some relationships represent total dependency. For example, the relationship between an employee and their dependents—a dependent always belongs to a specific employee. These entities depend heavily on another entity; their existence depends on the existence of another. These are called weak entities.\nIn E-R diagrams, weak entities are represented by double-lined rectangles.\nSuperclass and Subclass Entities For example, an \u0026ldquo;Employee\u0026rdquo; entity could be a superclass (parent class) for \u0026ldquo;Pilot,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Mechanic,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Administrator\u0026rdquo; entities. There is an inheritance relationship between the superclass and subclasses.\nSubclass rectangles have vertical lines on the sides, and the line connecting the superclass and subclass contains a circle.\nConceptual Structure Design Phase Establishing a conceptual model using the E-R method.\nThis involves classifying, aggregating, and summarizing data from the requirement analysis phase to determine entities, attributes, and relationships. The specific steps include selecting local applications, designing individual local E-R diagrams, and merging them.\nRequirement Analysis → Abstract Data → Design Local Views → Merge \u0026amp; Resolve Conflicts → Refine/Remove Redundancy → Logical Structure Design Phase.\nSelect Local Applications Choose appropriate levels of the Data Flow Diagram (DFD) so each part corresponds to a local application implementing a specific function.\nDesign Individual Local E-R Diagrams After defining local applications, design a local E-R diagram for each one.\nMerge E-R Diagrams Once local E-R diagrams are ready, merge them into a single global E-R diagram. The goal is to resolve conflicts between local diagrams.\nThere are three main types of conflicts between local E-R diagrams:\nAttribute Conflicts The same attribute might exist in different local diagrams. Different designers might use different data types, value ranges, or units. These must be unified for computer storage.\nNaming Conflicts The same concept might have different names (synonyms), or the same name might represent different concepts (homonyms) in different diagrams. These must be unified.\nStructural Conflicts An entity might have different attributes in different diagrams, or an object might be abstracted as an entity in one diagram and an attribute in another. These need to be consistent.\nLogical Structure Design Phase Logical structure design creates a data model based on the conceptual design. This could be hierarchical, network, or relational. This section covers mapping a global E-R diagram to a relational model. Key steps include determining the data model, converting E-R diagrams, defining integrity constraints (entity, referential, and user-defined), and determining user views.\nConceptual Design → Convert to Data Model → Normalize Relations → Schema Optimization → Design User Subschemas → Physical Design Phase.\nConverting E-R Diagrams to Relational Schemas The global conceptual model describes the information world and isn\u0026rsquo;t directly suited for computer processing. To work with a RDBMS, the E-R diagram must be converted. While E-R diagrams have entities, attributes, and relationships, relational models only have one structure: the relation (table).\n1. Converting Entities to Relations Each entity becomes a relation. The entity name is the relation name, entity attributes become relation attributes, and the entity identifier becomes the primary key.\n2. Converting Relationships to Relations One-to-One (1:1) Relationship One way is to merge the relationship into either of the two entities. Add the primary key of the other entity and any attributes of the relationship to the chosen entity\u0026rsquo;s attributes. The primary key of the merged entity remains the same.\nAnother way (rarely used) is to create a separate relation. Its name is the relationship name, attributes include the primary keys of both entities plus relationship attributes. The primary key can be the primary key of either entity.\nOne-to-Many (1:n) Relationship One way is to merge the relationship into the \u0026ldquo;many\u0026rdquo; side. Add the primary key of the \u0026ldquo;one\u0026rdquo; side and any relationship attributes to the \u0026ldquo;many\u0026rdquo; side entity. The primary key of the \u0026ldquo;many\u0026rdquo; side remains the same.\nAnother way (rarely used) is to create a separate relation. Attributes include the primary keys of both entities plus relationship attributes. The primary key is the primary key of the \u0026ldquo;many\u0026rdquo; side entity.\nMany-to-Many (m:n) Relationship Must be converted into an independent relation. The name is the relationship name. Attributes include the primary keys of both entities plus relationship attributes. The primary key is the combination of the primary keys of both entities.\nMany-to-Many-to-Many (n-ary) Relationship Essentially the same as m:n.\nSuperclass and Subclass Conversion Both superclass and subclass entities can be converted into relations. The primary key of the superclass is added to the subclass relation.\nNormalizing Relational Schemas Determine data dependencies based on semantics. Determine the normal form of the schemas based on those dependencies. If a schema doesn\u0026rsquo;t meet requirements, decompose it using decomposition algorithms to reach 3NF, BCNF, or 4NF. Evaluate and refine the schemas. Physical Design Phase Logical Design → Determine Physical Database Schema → Evaluate Physical Schema → Implementation Phase.\nDatabase Implementation and Maintenance Physical Design → Define Database → Load Data \u0026amp; Write Applications → Trial Run → Operation and Maintenance Phase.\n","date":"2023-02-11T08:15:00+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/91/","title":"Database Learning 6: Database Design"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash SQL Series\nDatabase Study One: Database Introduction: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/86 Database Study Two: Relational Model: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/87 Database Study Three: SQL Language: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/88 Database Study Four: Relational Database Theory: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/89 Database Study Five: Normal Forms: This Article\nDatabase Study Six: Database Design: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/91 Database Study Seven: Database Control Functions: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/92 Relations in a relational database must meet certain normalization requirements. Normal forms are used to measure different degrees of normalization. Currently, there are 6 main normal forms: 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, 4NF, and 5NF.\nThe minimum requirement is 1NF. Meeting additional requirements beyond 1NF leads to 2NF, and so on. Among these, 3NF and BCNF are the most crucial and are the primary goals for normalization.\nA relational schema in a lower normal form can be converted into a set of relational schemas in a higher normal form through schema decomposition. This process is called normalization.\nFirst Normal Form (1NF) Definition: Let R be a relational schema. R is in First Normal Form (1NF) if and only if the domain of every attribute A in R contains only atomic (indivisible) values.\n1NF cannot eliminate issues like data redundancy, update (insertion, deletion) anomalies, or complex modifications, as partial functional dependencies might still exist.\nSecond Normal Form (2NF) Definition: Let R be a relational schema. R is in Second Normal Form (2NF) if and only if it is in 1NF, and every non-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on a candidate key.\nRelational schemas in 2NF might still suffer from data redundancy and update anomalies due to the possible existence of transitive functional dependencies.\nThird Normal Form (3NF) Definition: Let R be a relational schema. R is in Third Normal Form (3NF) if and only if it is in 2NF, and every non-key attribute is non-transitively dependent on a candidate key.\nRelational schemas in 3NF might still have partial and transitive dependencies involving prime attributes (attributes that are part of any candidate key).\nBoyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) Definition: Let R be a relational schema, and F be its set of dependencies. R is in BCNF if and only if R is in 3NF, and for every non-trivial functional dependency X → Y in F, X is a superkey of R.\nFrom the definition of BCNF, we can conclude that a relational schema satisfying BCNF has the following properties:\nAll non-prime attributes are fully functionally dependent on every key. All prime attributes are also fully functionally dependent on every key that does not contain them. No attribute is fully functionally dependent on any set of attributes that is not a key. A relational schema R satisfying BCNF has eliminated insertion and deletion anomalies.\nA relational schema with only two attributes is always in BCNF.\nFourth Normal Form (4NF) Definition: A relational schema R\u0026lt;U, F\u0026gt; is in 1NF. It is in Fourth Normal Form (4NF) if, for every non-trivial multi-valued dependency X →→ Y (Y ⊈ X) in R, X is a superkey of R.\nMulti-valued Dependency Given a relational schema R\u0026lt;U, F\u0026gt;, where X, Y, Z are subsets of U, and Z = U - X - Y. A multi-valued dependency X →→ Y holds in R if and only if, for any relation r of R, given a pair of (x, z) values, there exists a set of Y values that depends solely on the x value and is independent of the z value.\nTrivial Multi-valued Dependency If X →→ Y holds in the above definition of multi-valued dependency, and Z is an empty set, then X →→ Y is called a trivial multi-valued dependency.\nNormal Form Summary 1NF (First Normal Form) All field values are atomic (indivisible).\n2NF (Second Normal Form) No partial functional dependency of non-prime attributes on a key. A table should only store one type of data, not multiple types in the same table.\n3NF (Third Normal Form) No transitive functional dependency of non-prime attributes on a key. Ensures every column in the table directly relates to the primary key, not indirectly.\nBCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form) Eliminates transitive dependencies of any attribute on a candidate key. BCNF is a refined 3NF.\n1NF → 2NF: Eliminates partial functional dependencies of non-prime attributes on a key.\n2NF → 3NF: Eliminates transitive functional dependencies of non-prime attributes on a key.\n3NF → BCNF: Eliminates partial and transitive functional dependencies of prime attributes on a key.\nBCNF → 4NF: Eliminates non-trivial, non-functional multi-valued dependencies.\nA relation where all candidate keys are single attributes is inherently in 2NF.\nRelational Schema Decomposition For relational schemas with data redundancy, insertion anomalies, or deletion anomalies, decomposition into multiple relational schemas is the solution. Accordingly, data originally stored in one 2D table will be distributed across multiple tables. For this decomposition to be meaningful, a minimum requirement is that the latter must not lose information from the former.\nNew issues arise during decomposition. To ensure the decomposed schema retains the properties of the original schema, the fundamental requirements are that the schema decomposition must have the lossless join property and dependency preservation.\nLossless Join Lossless join means that when a relational schema is decomposed, any valid instance of the original relational schema should be recoverable through natural join operations after decomposition.\nIn other words, the decomposed relations can be reconstructed into the original relation via natural join.\nDependency Preservation This refers to whether F\u0026rsquo; (the union of functional dependencies in the sub-schemas after decomposition) is equivalent to F (the original set of functional dependencies). If F\u0026rsquo; contains all functional dependencies in F, then dependency preservation is achieved (a sufficient condition).\nIn other words, dependencies remain unchanged after decomposition.\nReference: Schema Decomposition Dependency Preservation Judgment - Database Exam Review_guoyp2126\u0026rsquo;s blog-CSDN blog Given R (ABCDEGH) and F={A-\u0026gt;D, E-\u0026gt;D, D-\u0026gt;B, BC-\u0026gt;D, DC-\u0026gt;A}, find a dependency-preserving 3NF decomposition.\nFind the minimal functional dependency set. Identify attributes not in F and group them separately. Group dependencies with the same left-hand side. If there\u0026rsquo;s no match, convert A-\u0026gt;D to {AD}. If there are matches, like {A-\u0026gt;B, A-\u0026gt;C}, then convert to {ABC}. If a candidate key is not present in the separated groups, make any one candidate key a separate group.

U: A set of attributes. D: The domains from which the attributes in U originate. dom: The mapping from attributes to domains. F: A set of data dependencies (functional dependencies) on the attribute set U. Since points 3 and 4 have little impact on schema design, we usually simplify the relational schema to a triple: R\u0026lt;U, F\u0026gt;. A relation $r$ on $U$ is a relation of schema R\u0026lt;U, F\u0026gt; if and only if $r$ satisfies $F$.\nExample: R is a grade table, U = (StudentID, Name, CourseID, Grade), F = {StudentID → Name, CourseID → CourseName, (StudentID, CourseID) → Grade}.\nFunctional Dependency (FD) Functional dependency is the most fundamental type of data dependency.\nLet R(U) be a relational schema on attribute set U, and X, Y be subsets of U. If for every possible relation $r$ of R(U), it is impossible for two tuples to have the same values for attributes in X but different values for attributes in Y, then X functionally determines Y (or Y is functionally dependent on X). This is denoted as X → Y.\nNon-trivial Functional Dependency If X → Y but Y ⊈ X, it is a non-trivial FD. Usually, we only care about non-trivial FDs.\nTrivial Functional Dependency If X → Y and Y ⊆ X, it is a trivial FD.\nFull Functional Dependency In R(U), if X → Y and for any proper subset X\u0026rsquo; of X, X\u0026rsquo; does not determine Y, then Y is fully functionally dependent on X. Denoted as X -F-\u0026gt; Y.\nPartial Functional Dependency If X → Y but Y is not fully functionally dependent on X, it is a partial FD. Denoted as X -P-\u0026gt; Y.\nTransitive Dependency In R(U, F), if X → Y, Y ⊈ X, and Y → Z, then Z is transitively dependent on X.\nReference: Untitled Document (pop0726.github.io) Keys Let K be a combination of attributes in R(U, F). If K → U and for any proper subset K\u0026rsquo; of K, K\u0026rsquo; does not determine U, then K is a Candidate Key. If there are multiple candidate keys, pick one to be the Primary Key.\nPrimary Attribute vs. Non-primary Attribute Attributes contained in any candidate key are primary attributes. Others are non-primary attributes.\nForeign Key If an attribute (or group) X in R(U) is not a key for R but is a key for another relation, X is a foreign key.\nSuperkey Any set of attributes that can determine all attributes in the relation. A candidate key is a minimal superkey.\nAll-key A case where all attributes combined form the primary key.\nArmstrong\u0026rsquo;s Axioms For a relational schema R(U, F), the following inference rules apply:\nReflexivity: If Y ⊆ X ⊆ U, then X → Y is implied by F. Augmentation: If X → Y is implied by F and Z ⊆ U, then XZ → YZ is implied by F. Transitivity: If X → Y and Y → Z are implied by F, then X → Z is implied by F. Derived rules:\nUnion: If X → Y and X → Z, then X → YZ. Pseudo-transitivity: If X → Y and WY → Z, then XW → Z. Decomposition: If X → Y and Z ⊆ Y, then X → Z. Attribute Closure Calculation Closure calculation is used to find candidate keys. Here is the logic:\nAttributes appearing only on the left side of FDs must be part of the candidate key. Attributes appearing only on the right side cannot be part of a candidate key. Attributes appearing on both sides or neither side need to be checked. Attributes appearing on neither side must be part of the candidate key. Calculate the closure of the \u0026ldquo;must-be\u0026rdquo; attributes. If the closure includes all attributes, they form the candidate key. Otherwise, add other potential attributes one by one and re-calculate the closure. Example: R\u0026lt;U, F\u0026gt;, U(A, B, C, D, E, G) F = {AB → C, CD → E, E → A, A → G}. Find candidate keys.\nOnly on left: B, D (Must be in key) Only on right: G (Cannot be in key) Both sides: A, C, E Calculate closure: (BD)⁺: Nothing extra. We need to add attributes from {A, C, E}. (BDA)⁺: → C, E, A, G. Results in ABCDEG. (Candidate Key) (BDC)⁺: → E, A, G. Results in ABCDEG. (Candidate Key) (BDE)⁺: → A, G, C. Results in ABCDEG. (Candidate Key) Candidate keys: {(BDA), (BDC), (BDE)}\nFinding the Minimal Functional Dependency Set How to find the minimal set?\nDecompose the right side (e.g., A → BC becomes A → B and A → C). Remove redundant dependencies: For each FD, check if the right side can still be determined by the left side using the other remaining FDs. Minimalize the left side: For FDs with multiple attributes on the left (e.g., BCD → A), check if a subset of the left side (like CD) can determine the right side. Example: R\u0026lt;U, F\u0026gt; U{A, B, C, D, E, F, G} F = {BCD → A, BC → E, A → F, F → G, C → D, A → G}. Find the minimal set.\nSolution:\n// (1) Decompose RHS (Already mostly done, but A → G is redundant if we look ahead)\n(BCD)⁺ = BCDED\u0026hellip;\n(BC)⁺ = BCD\n(A)⁺ = AG\n(F)⁺ = F\n(C)⁺ = C\n(A)⁺ = AFG (Wait, check if A → G can be derived from A → F and F → G. Yes. So remove A → G).\n// (2) Minimalize LHS\nIn BCD → A, we have C → D. So BCD → A can be simplified to BC → A.\nFinal Minimal Set:\nBC → A\nBC → E\nA → F\nF → G\nC → D\n","date":"2023-02-09T08:10:00+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/89/","title":"Relational Database Theory: Database Learning Part 4"},{"content":" SQL Series\nDatabase Learning 1: Introduction: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/86 Database Learning 2: Relational Model: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/87 Database Learning 3: SQL: This article\nDatabase Learning 4: Relational Database Theory: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/89 Database Learning 5: Normal Forms: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/90 Database Learning 6: Database Design: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/91 Database Learning 7: Database Control Functions: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/92 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview SQL Classification DDL (Data Definition Language) In a database system, every database, table, view, and index is an object.

INSERT Statement Two ways to insert data: direct tuple insertion or using query results.\nDirect tuple insertion 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 insert into table_name[(column_list)] values (tuple_values)[, ...] -- Or insert into table_name[(column_list)] (table (tuple_values)[, (tuple_values), ...]) -- Example insert into student values (\u0026#39;108\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Zhang San\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;M\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;2000-01-01\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;09033\u0026#39;), (\u0026#39;109\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Li Si\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;M\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;2000-05-05\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;09034\u0026#39;) -- Insert specific columns insert into student(sno, sname, ssex, sbirthday) values (110, \u0026#39;Wang Wu\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;M\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;2000-04-18\u0026#39;) Insert from a query result 1 2 3 4 5 insert into table_name[(column_list)] select \u0026lt;query_statement\u0026gt; -- Example insert into student select 111, \u0026#39;Zhao Liu\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;M\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;2000-03-19\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;09035\u0026#39; 2. DELETE Statement 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 delete from \u0026lt;table_name\u0026gt; [where \u0026lt;condition\u0026gt;] -- Example delete from student -- Deletes all content in the table -- Delete tuple where sno is 111 delete from student where sno = 111 3. UPDATE Statement 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 update \u0026lt;table_name\u0026gt; set \u0026lt;column_name\u0026gt; = \u0026lt;expression\u0026gt;[, ...] [where \u0026lt;condition\u0026gt;] -- Example update student set class = \u0026#39;09058\u0026#39; where sno = 110 -- Or update student set class = \u0026#39;09057\u0026#39;, ssex = \u0026#39;F\u0026#39; where sno = 110 and class = \u0026#39;09058\u0026#39; (III) DQL: Data Query Language DQL is implemented via the SELECT statement. Complete syntax:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 select \u0026lt;column_list_or_expressions\u0026gt; from \u0026lt;table_list\u0026gt; [where \u0026lt;row_condition\u0026gt;] [group by \u0026lt;column_list\u0026gt;] [having \u0026lt;group_condition\u0026gt;] [order by \u0026lt;column_name\u0026gt; [asc|desc]] 1. Projection Queries SELECT retrieves specific columns. Use , for multiple columns. In FROM, list all involved tables.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 -- Examples select 1 + 1 select sno * 100 from student -- Query student sno and scores select student.sno, score.degree from student, score -- Query all columns select * from student Use DISTINCT to remove duplicate rows.\n1 2 3 -- Query distinct courses that were taken select distinct cno from score Use AS for column aliasing.\n1 2 3 -- Example select sno as \u0026#39;student_id\u0026#39; from student 2. Selection Queries Selection filters records based on specific criteria.\nCommon operators:\nOperator Syntax Description Set Membership IN / NOT IN In set / Not in set String Matching LIKE Pattern match with _ and % Null Comparison IS NULL / IS NOT NULL Is null / Is not null Arithmetic \u0026gt;, \u0026gt;=, \u0026lt;, \u0026lt;=, =, \u0026lt;\u0026gt; Standard comparison operators Logic AND, OR, NOT Standard logical operators \u0026lt;1\u0026gt; Range Comparison 1 2 3 4 5 6 -- Query scores between 60 and 80 select * from score where degree between 60 and 80 -- \u0026#39;between\u0026#39; is inclusive: [60, 80] -- Equivalent to: where degree \u0026gt;= 60 and degree \u0026lt;= 80 \u0026lt;2\u0026gt; String Matching 1 where [not] like \u0026#39;pattern\u0026#39; [escape \u0026#39;escape_char\u0026#39;] %: Any number of characters _: Any single character \u0026lt;3\u0026gt; Set Comparison 1 2 3 4 -- Query scores that are 85, 86, or 88 select * from score where degree in (85, 86, 88) \u0026lt;4\u0026gt; Logical Combinations 1 2 3 4 -- Query all female students in class 09031 select * from student where class = \u0026#39;09031\u0026#39; and ssex = \u0026#39;F\u0026#39; 3. Sorting Queries Use ORDER BY for sorting.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 -- Ascending (default) select sno, sname from student order by sno -- Descending select sno, sname from student order by sno desc Multiple columns can be specified.\n1 2 3 4 -- Sort by cno ascending, then degree descending select * from score order by cno asc, degree desc ORDER BY must be the last clause!\n4. Aggregate Functions Aggregate functions calculate a single value from a set of values. Usually used with GROUP BY.\nFunction Description AVG Average value COUNT Number of items (COUNT(*) for total rows) MIN Minimum value MAX Maximum value SUM Total sum STDEV Standard deviation General format:\n1 [all|distinct] expr ALL is the default. DISTINCT only considers unique values.\n1 2 3 4 -- Count students in class \u0026#39;09031\u0026#39; select count(*) as \u0026#39;total\u0026#39; from student where class = \u0026#39;09031\u0026#39; 5. Data Grouping Aggregate functions return one result. Mixing raw columns with aggregate functions without grouping causes errors. GROUP BY changes the scope of the aggregate function to each group. Use HAVING to filter groups.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 -- Query sno where min score \u0026gt; 70 and max score \u0026lt; 90 select sno from score where degree is not null group by sno having min(degree) \u0026gt; 70 and max(degree) \u0026lt; 90 Execution order:\nWHERE: Filter rows GROUP BY: Group rows Aggregate functions calculated HAVING: Filter groups 1 2 3 4 -- Average score per course select cno, avg(degree) from score group by cno HAVING filters groups (usually with aggregates). WHERE filters rows. When using SELECT with columns and aggregates, all columns must be in GROUP BY.\n6. Table Joins Specify tables in FROM and conditions in WHERE.\n1 2 3 select \u0026lt;columns\u0026gt; from \u0026lt;tables\u0026gt; where \u0026lt;join_condition\u0026gt; Common columns require prefixes (e.g., student.sno).\n\u0026lt;1\u0026gt; Inner Join Theta join, Equi-join, Natural join. INNER JOIN is the basic join.\nEqui-join 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 -- Query names, course IDs, and scores select student.sname, score.cno, score.degree from student, score where student.sno = score.sno -- Or using syntax: select student.sname, score.cno, score.degree from student inner join score on student.sno = score.sno Table aliases simplify queries:\n1 2 3 select x.sname, y.cno, y.degree from student x, score y where x.sno = y.sno Non-equi join: Relationship is not \u0026ldquo;=\u0026rdquo;.\nSelf-join: Joining a table to itself.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 -- Students in course \u0026#39;3-105\u0026#39; with scores higher than student \u0026#39;109\u0026#39; in the same course select x.cno, x.sno, x.degree from score x, score y where x.cno = \u0026#39;3-105\u0026#39; and x.degree \u0026gt; y.degree and y.sno = \u0026#39;109\u0026#39; and y.cno = \u0026#39;3-105\u0026#39; order by x.degree desc \u0026lt;2\u0026gt; Outer Join LEFT OUTER JOIN (or LEFT JOIN) RIGHT OUTER JOIN (or RIGHT JOIN) FULL OUTER JOIN (or FULL JOIN) 1 2 3 4 -- Left join example select course.cname, teacher.tname from course left join teacher on (course.tno = teacher.tno) 7. Subqueries \u0026lt;1\u0026gt; General Subquery Used when a query condition depends on another query. Frequently in the WHERE clause.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 -- Students born in the same year as student \u0026#39;105\u0026#39; select sno, sname, year(sbirthday) as \u0026#39;birth_year\u0026#39; from student where year(sbirthday) = ( select year(sbirthday) from student where sno = \u0026#39;105\u0026#39; ) \u0026lt;2\u0026gt; Correlated Subquery In a correlated subquery, the inner query references columns from the outer query and executes once for each candidate row in the outer query.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 -- Students whose score is lower than the course average select sno, cno, degree from score a where degree \u0026lt; ( select avg(degree) from score b where a.cno = b.cno and degree is not null ) \u0026lt;3\u0026gt; EXISTS Subquery EXISTS returns true if the subquery returns any rows.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 -- Names and departments of all teachers who teach a course select tname, depart from teacher a where exists ( select * from course b where a.tno = b.tno ) NOT EXISTS negates the logic.\n8. Set Operations Combine multiple SELECT results:\nUNION: Union (Set sum) INTERSECT: Intersection EXCEPT: Difference 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 -- Union example -- Names, genders, and birth years of all teachers and students select sname, ssex, year(sbirthday) from teacher union select sname, ssex, year(sbirthday) from student (IV) DCL: Data Control Language DCL controls access rights, usually managed by the DBA (Database Administrator).\nDatabase Security Security factors:\nMalicious access/destruction Sensitive data leakage Environmental vulnerabilities Controls:\nIdentity Authentication (passwords, biometrics, etc.) Access Control Discretionary Access Control (DAC): Users can grant permissions to others. Discretionary Access Control (DAC) Functions:\nNotify system of authorization via GRANT and REVOKE. Check requests against authorizations in the data dictionary. Standard permissions: DELETE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE. SELECT is equivalent to READ. REFERENCES restricts the ability to create foreign keys.\n1. GRANT Syntax 1 2 3 4 grant \u0026lt;privileges\u0026gt; on \u0026lt;object_type\u0026gt; \u0026lt;object_name\u0026gt; to \u0026lt;user\u0026gt; [with grant option] PUBLIC: Grants permission to all users. WITH GRANT OPTION: Allows the user to grant that permission to others. 2. REVOKE Syntax 1 2 3 revoke \u0026lt;privileges\u0026gt; on \u0026lt;object_type\u0026gt; \u0026lt;object_name\u0026gt; from \u0026lt;user\u0026gt; Database Roles Roles represent groups of users (e.g., CEO, Developer).\nCreate Role: create role \u0026lt;role_name\u0026gt; Grant to Role: grant \u0026lt;privilege\u0026gt; on \u0026lt;object\u0026gt; to \u0026lt;role\u0026gt; Assign Role to User: grant \u0026lt;role\u0026gt; to \u0026lt;user\u0026gt; [with admin option] Revoke from Role: revoke \u0026lt;privilege\u0026gt; on \u0026lt;object\u0026gt; from \u0026lt;role\u0026gt; View Mechanism A view is a virtual table derived from base tables or other views. It hides unnecessary data from users for security and simplicity.\nCreate View 1 2 3 create view \u0026lt;view_name\u0026gt; as select \u0026lt;query\u0026gt; [with check option] Subqueries usually shouldn\u0026rsquo;t use ORDER BY or DISTINCT. WITH CHECK OPTION ensures UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE operations on the view satisfy the view\u0026rsquo;s query condition. 1 2 3 4 5 6 -- Example: View for CS students create view cs_student as select sno, sname, ssex from student where depart = \u0026#39;CS\u0026#39; with check option Drop View 1 drop view \u0026lt;view_name\u0026gt; Auditing Records all database operations to an audit log to detect illegal behavior.\n1 2 AUDIT UPDATE ON score; NOAUDIT UPDATE ON score; Data Encryption Uses algorithms to transform plaintext into ciphertext for storage.\nIndexes Indexes allow the DB engine to find data without scanning the whole table.

Here are some basic terms:\nRelation: A relation is a two-dimensional table. Each relation has a name. Tuple: A row in the table is a tuple, corresponding to a record value in a storage file. Attribute: Columns in a table are called attributes. Each column has an attribute name. Attribute values correspond to data items or field values in a record. Domain: The range of values an attribute can take. Relation Schema: A description of the relation. It consists of the relation name and its set of attributes. The format is: RelationName(Attribute 1, ..., Attribute n). Usually, one relation schema corresponds to the structure of one relation file.\nCandidate Key: An attribute or set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple. Primary Key: If a relation has multiple candidate keys, one is chosen as the primary key. Prime Attribute: Attributes included in any candidate key are called prime attributes. Others are non-prime attributes. Foreign Key: If an attribute (or group of attributes) in a relation is not a key for that relation but is a key for another relation, it is a foreign key. All-key: When all attributes of a relation schema form the candidate key. Superkey: A set of attributes that contains a key. Definition of the Relational Model A relation schema can be formally represented as: R(U, D, dom, F)\nWhere R is the relation name, U is the set of attributes, D is the domain of the attributes, dom is the mapping from attributes to domains, and F is the set of data dependencies between attributes.\nCommonly abbreviated as R(U) or R($A_1$, $A_2$, \u0026hellip;), where R is the relation name and $A_1$, $A_2$ are attribute names.\nA relational model consists of three parts: relational data structure, relational operations, and relational integrity constraints.\nRelational Data Structure The logical data structure in a relational model is a simple 2D table.\nRelational Operations The relational model defines a set of operations for data manipulation.\nCommon operations include: Select, Project, Join, Divide, Union, Intersection, Difference (queries), as well as Insert, Delete, and Update.\nRelational Integrity Constraints There are three main integrity rules:\nEntity Integrity: The primary key cannot be null or partially null. Referential Integrity: If a foreign key X in relation $R_2$ matches the primary key of relation $R_1$, then every value of X in $R_2$ must either exist in the primary key of $R_1$ or be null. User-defined Integrity: Constraints defined by the user for specific data requirements. Relational Algebra Operators Operator Category Symbol Meaning Set Operators ∪\n–\n∩\n× Union\nDifference\nIntersection\nCartesian Product Specialized Relational Operators σ\nπ\n⋈\n÷ Select\nProject\nJoin\nDivide Comparison Operators ＞\n≥\n＜\n≤\n＝\n≠ Greater than\nGreater or equal\nLess than\nLess or equal\nEqual\nNot equal Logical Operators ¬\n∧\n∨ Not\nAnd\nOr Traditional Set Operations Specialized Relational Operators Join Joins include θ-join, Equijoin, and Natural join.\nθ-join: Join condition uses any comparison operator (not just equals). Equijoin: Join condition uses the equality operator. Natural Join: An equijoin that removes duplicate attributes. This is the most common join. Project Projection is a vertical operation. It selects specific attribute columns A from relation R to form a new relation, denoted as $π_A(R)$.\nSelect Selection is a horizontal operation. It selects tuples from relation R that satisfy a given condition F, denoted as $σ_F(R)$.\nOuter Join An extension of the join operation to handle missing information.\nLeft Outer Join: Includes all tuples from the left relation. If no match is found in the right relation, attributes from the right are filled with NULL. Right Outer Join: Includes all tuples from the right relation. If no match is found in the left relation, attributes from the left are filled with NULL. Full Outer Join: Combines both Left and Right outer joins.

Data is organized, described, and stored according to specific data models, featuring low redundancy, high data independence, easy scalability, and accessibility for various users.\nDatabase Management System (DBMS) A layer of data management software situated between the user and the operating system. Like an OS, it is fundamental computer software.\nKey Functions:\nData Definition Data Organization, Storage, and Management Data Manipulation Transaction Management and Operational Management Database Establishment and Maintenance Other functions (communication, data conversion, interoperability, etc.) Database System (DBS) A system that stores, manages, processes, and maintains data, consisting of the database, DBMS (and its development tools), applications, and the Database Administrator (DBA).\nEvolution of Computer Data Management Manual Management Phase (Before the mid-1950s) Data is not saved, not shared, and lacks independence. File System Phase (Late 1950s to mid-1960s) Data can be saved, but sharing is poor, redundancy is high, and independence is low. Database System Phase (Starting from the late 1960s) The emergence of DBS shifted information systems from being \u0026ldquo;program-centric for data processing\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;shared database-centric,\u0026rdquo; achieving structuralization of overall data. High shareability, low redundancy, and easy expansion: Redundancy is significantly reduced, saving storage space while maintaining high data independence. Classification of Data Models Depending on the purpose, models are divided into two levels. Models abstracted from the information world are called Conceptual Data Models. Models abstracted from the computer world supported by a DBMS are called Structural Data Models (or simply Data Models).\nConceptual Data Model (Conceptual Model) This model is independent of computer systems and doesn\u0026rsquo;t involve how information is represented in a system. It describes the information structure for a specific organization from a user perspective. It\u0026rsquo;s used for modeling the information world, typically using the Entity-Relationship (E-R) method. It\u0026rsquo;s primarily used in database design.\nCommon terms:\nEntity: An object that exists objectively and can be distinguished from others. Attribute: A characteristic describing an entity. Key: A set of attributes that uniquely identifies an entity. Entity Type: An abstraction of similar entities using the entity name and its attributes. Entity Set: A collection of entities of the same type. Domain: The range of possible values for an attribute. Relationship: The correspondence between entities. Three types of relationships: One-to-One (1:1) One-to-Many (1:N) Many-to-Many (M:N) The conceptual model represented by the E-R method is called an E-R Diagram. Entities use rectangles, attributes use ovals, connected to entities by undirected edges.\nStructural Data Model (Logical Model) This model directly addresses the logical structure of a database. Every DBMS is based on a specific structural model. It\u0026rsquo;s primarily used for DBMS implementation.\nMain models include: Hierarchical, Network, Relational, and Object-Oriented.\nHierarchical Model Uses a \u0026ldquo;tree structure\u0026rdquo; to represent relationships. The data structure is a \u0026ldquo;directed tree.\u0026rdquo; Network Model Uses a \u0026ldquo;graph structure\u0026rdquo; to represent relationships. Relational Model Uses a two-dimensional table structure to represent entities and their relationships. Each table consists of rows and columns and is called a \u0026ldquo;relation.\u0026rdquo; A relation schema describes the relation. A relational model is a collection of relation schemas. Physical Model The lowest level of abstraction. It describes how data is represented and accessed internally within the system, or how it is stored and accessed on disks or tapes. It is oriented towards the computer system.\nDatabase System Architecture While database products vary, most share a common architecture: \u0026ldquo;Three-level Schema and Two-level Mapping.\u0026rdquo;\nThree-level Schema Conceptual Schema (Base Tables) Also called the logic schema. It\u0026rsquo;s the description of the logical structure and characteristics of all data in the database—the common view for all users. External Schema (Views) Also called the user schema or sub-schema. It\u0026rsquo;s the interface between the user and the DBS, describing only the part of the data the user needs. Internal Schema (Storage Files) Also called the storage schema. A database has only one internal schema. It describes the physical structure and storage method—how data is organized inside the database. Two-level Mapping DBS provides two mappings between the three schemas: Schema/Internal Mapping and External/Schema Mapping. These mappings ensure high logical and physical independence.\nSchema/Internal Mapping (Storage) Exists between the conceptual and internal levels. It handles the transformation between the conceptual schema and the internal schema. When the storage structure changes, the DBA updates this mapping so the conceptual schema remains unchanged. This ensures physical independence for applications. External/Schema Mapping (Views) Exists between the external and conceptual levels. It handles the transformation between external schemas and the conceptual schema. When the conceptual schema changes, the DBA updates the mappings so the external schemas remain unchanged. This ensures logical independence for applications. Data independence means separating the data definition from the program. This is guaranteed by the DBMS\u0026rsquo;s two-level mapping functions.\nPhysical Independence: User applications are independent of the physical storage of data. Logical Independence: User applications are independent of the logical structure of the database. This independence allows data definitions to be separated from apps. Since the DBMS manages data access, application development is simplified, reducing maintenance and modification costs.\nComponents of a Database System Hardware Platform and Database Sufficient RAM, disks/arrays, and high I/O throughput for data transfer. Software DBMS, the OS supporting it, high-level languages with database interfaces and their compilers, dev tools, and the specific database application systems.

Disks serve as permanent storage, while RAM (Random Access Memory) and swap space are used for temporary storage. For instance, when you run a command, it\u0026rsquo;s copied from the hard drive to RAM so the CPU (Central Processing Unit) can access it faster.\nThe CPU can access data from RAM much quicker than from the hard drive. However, because RAM is costly and data is lost when power is removed, disk capacity is far greater than RAM.\nWhen RAM is full due to running too many processes or a process with a memory leak, if the system doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide a way to extend memory, new processes will fail. This is where swap space comes in. Algorithms are used to move some data from RAM to disk, and then swap it back when needed.\nWhen you need to exchange files between different operating systems, the VFAT filesystem is commonly used.\n12.2 Partitioning Hard Drives Changing partitions can prevent your system from booting. It\u0026rsquo;s recommended to practice with an empty drive until you\u0026rsquo;re proficient before applying it to a live system.\n12.2.1 Understanding Partition Tables Traditionally, PC architecture computers used MBR (Master Boot Record) partition tables to store information about hard drive partition sizes and layout. However, in recent years, a new standard called GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) Partition Table has been adopted on some UEFI-based computers, replacing the older BIOS system boot method.\nThe inherent limitations of the MBR specification led to the need for GUID partitions. MBR partitions are limited to 2TB, while GUID partitions can create partitions up to 9.4ZB.\nThe fdisk command doesn\u0026rsquo;t support GPT partitions; you can use the parted command instead.\n12.2.2 Viewing Disk Partitions fdisk -l /dev/sda or parted -l /dev/sdb\nSCSI or USB storage devices, represented by sd? devices (e.g., sda, sdb), can have up to 16 minor devices (e.g., the primary /dev/sdc device and /dev/sdc1 to /dev/sdc15), totaling 15 partitions.\nNVMe SSD storage devices, represented by nvme devices (e.g., nvme0, nvme1), can be divided into one or more namespaces (most devices only use the first) and partitions. For example, /dev/nvme0n1p1 refers to the first partition in the first namespace on the first NVMe device.\nFor x86 computers, a disk can have a maximum of 4 primary partitions. If you want more than 4 partitions, at least one must be an extended partition. Any partitions beyond the four primary ones are logical partitions, using space from the extended partition.\n12.2.3 Creating a Single-Partition Drive The general process for adding a storage medium:\nInstall the new hard drive or insert the new USB flash drive. Partition the new hard drive. Create a filesystem on the new hard drive. Mount the filesystem. If you\u0026rsquo;re using the parted command for modifications, proceed with caution at each step, as parted changes take effect immediately. The fdisk command, however, is reversible; changes are only applied when you explicitly confirm.\nData is invaluable, handle with care.\nDetermine the name of the newly added device.\nThere are many ways, for example, by checking system logs: journalctl -f\nFor example, let\u0026rsquo;s assume the assigned name is /dev/sdb.\nIf the device is auto-mounted, you need to unmount it first.\nCheck if /dev/sdb is mounted: mount | grep sdb\nUnmount the partition: umount /dev/sdb1\nUse the parted command to create a partition.\nparted /dev/sdb\nAfter executing, you will be in parted command mode. You can use parted single-letter commands to manage partitions.\nDelete a partition.\nThe single command p lists all partitions.\nUse the rm command, then press Enter and input the corresponding Number to delete a partition.\nCreate a GPT partition table.\nUse the command mklabel gpt\nCreate a new partition.\nEnter the mkpart command. The system will prompt you for the partition name, filesystem type, and then the start and end of the partition.\nFor example, name it yexca-UDisk, use xfs as the filesystem type, and partition from 1MB to 123GB:\n1 2 3 4 5 (parted) mkpart Partition name? []? yexca-UDisk File system type? [ext2]? xfs Start? 1 End? 123GB Check if the partition was created correctly.\nThe single command p lists all partitions.\nAfter the partition is created, you need to create a filesystem on it.\nFor example, to create an xfs filesystem: mkfs -t xfs /dev/sdb1\nIf the -t option is omitted, an ext2 filesystem is created by default.\nMount the filesystem.\n1 2 3 4 # Create the mount directory mkdir /mnt/tmp # Mount /dev/sdb1 to /mnt/tmp mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/tmp Unmount the filesystem.\nUse the command umount /dev/sdb1\nBy default, USB devices are generally auto-mounted when inserted.\nIf you need to manually mount, add a line to /etc/fstab:\n1 /dev/sdb1 /mnt/tmp xfs defaults 0 1 This line has six fields:\nPartition Mount directory Filesystem type Mount options at boot (e.g., defaults for default options) Whether to use the dump command to back up partition files (0 for no backup) Filesystem check order (0 for no check, 1 for root, 2 for others) 12.2.4 Creating a Multi-Partition Disk Using the fdisk command as an example:\nEnter fdisk command mode.\nfdisk /dev/sdb\nCreate partitions.\nSingle command n, then choose p for a primary partition or e for an extended partition. Select the partition number (default is usually fine).\nThen specify the allocated space. The starting sector can be default; after pressing Enter, input the ending space. For example, to allocate 5 GB, enter +5G. If you enter a bare number, it will be interpreted as sectors.\nFor the fourth partition, which would be an extended partition, you can accept the default for both start and end sectors.\nCheck partitions.\nSingle command p.\nThe default partition type is Linux. If you want to change the partition type:\nUse command t, select the partition number, then enter L to view the list of partition types. Find the hexadecimal code, then enter it to change.\nReview changes and save them.\nSingle command p to review, single command w to save changes.\nAfter making changes, check if the kernel is aware of the partition table modifications.\n1 2 3 4 5 grep sdb /proc/partitions # If the expected output is not shown, execute the following command partprobe /dev/sdb # Check again grep sdb /proc/partitions Create filesystems.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # Create an ext4 filesystem mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb1 # Create swap space mkswap /dev/sdb2 # Create an ext2 filesystem (default) mkfs /dev/sdb3 # Create a VFAT filesystem mkfs -t vfat /dev/sdb4 # Make this partition an LVM physical volume pvcreate /dev/sdb5 12.3 Managing Partitions with Logical Volume Management If disk space runs out, you might have to copy data to a larger disk, a process that requires downtime and is inefficient.\nLVM (Logical Volume Management) provides a flexible and efficient way to handle changing storage requirements. With LVM, you can add physical disk partitions to a pool of space called a volume group. Logical volumes then allocate space from the volume group as needed.\n12.3.1 Checking Existing LVM Use the command fdisk -l /dev/sda to check for existing Linux LVM partitions. Let\u0026rsquo;s assume /dev/sda2 is an LVM partition.\nCheck if this LVM partition is used in an LVM group:\npvdisplay /dev/sda2\nAssuming the volume group (VG Name) is vg_abc, view the volume group information:\nvgdisplay vg_abc\nFrom this, you can see the PE (Physical Extent) Size, which is the minimum storage unit used by the physical volume.\nView the allocation locations of the volume group\u0026rsquo;s PEs:\nlvdisplay vg_abc\nThe output will show multiple logical volume names. These logical volumes can be mounted directly by name, just like physical volumes.\n12.3.2 Creating LVM Logical Volumes Using LVM logical volumes is a top-down process, while creating them is a bottom-up process. First, create one or more physical volumes (pv), then use the physical volumes to create a volume group (vg), and finally create logical volumes (lv) from the volume group.\nPrepare a storage device with an LVM partition.\nThe creation process was mentioned in 12.2.4.\nAdd this physical volume to a volume group.\nvgcreate myvg0 /dev/sdb5\nView the volume group.\nvgdisplay myvg0\nIf the partition is 400M, you can use 396M of space (in 4M units).\n1 2 3 4 5 6 # Create a logical volume from a portion of the volume group space, e.g., create a 1G logical volume lvcreate -n name -L 1G myvg0 # Check if the logical volume exists ls /dev/mapper/myvg0* # If the following output is shown, creation was successful /dev/mapper/myvg0-name Create a filesystem and mount it.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 # Create an ext4 filesystem mkfs -t ext4 /dev/mapper/myvg0-name # Create a mount directory mkdir /mnt/tmp # Mount mount /dev/mapper/myvg0-name /mnt/tmp # Check if mounting was successful df -h /mnt/tmp Alternatively, you can add an entry to /etc/fstab for automatic mounting.\n12.3.3 Extending LVM Logical Volumes If you run out of space on a logical volume, you can add space without unmounting it. To do this, the volume group must have available space, and then you can extend the logical volume.\nCheck remaining space.\n1 2 3 4 # Check available space in the volume group vgdisplay myvg0 # Check available space in the logical volume df -h /mnt/tmp Extend the logical volume.\nlvextend -L +1G /dev/mapper/myvg0-name\nResize the filesystem.\nresize2fs -p /dev/mapper/myvg0-name\nCheck if resizing was successful.\ndf -h /mnt/tmp\n12.4 Mounting Filesystems In fact, the mount command and automatic mount configuration (the /etc/fstab file) have already been covered in the previous two sections.\n12.4.1 Supported Filesystems Enter the command cat /proc/filesystems to view supported filesystem types. The following is just a partial list:\nFilesystem Description ext4 Successor to the popular ext3 filesystem. Supports volumes up to 1EB and files up to 16 TB. iso9660 Evolved from the High Sierra filesystem (the original standard for CD-ROMs). Data CD-ROMs typically use this filesystem. Minix Originally used for the Minix version of UNIX. Supports filenames with a maximum of 30 characters. msdos MS-DOS filesystem type, can be used to mount floppies from Windows operating systems. vfat Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s extended FAT filesystem type. exfat An extended FAT filesystem optimized for SD cards, USB drives, and other flash memory. proc Not a true filesystem. It\u0026rsquo;s a Linux kernel filesystem interface. The /proc mount point should be a proc filesystem. Many utilities rely on /proc to access Linux kernel information. ReiserFS A journaling filesystem. Once the default filesystem for several Linux distributions, but now ext and xfs are more common. swap Used for swap partitions. squashfs A compressed and read-only filesystem type. NFS Network Filesystem, used to mount filesystems on other Linux or UNIX computers. ntfs Windows NT filesystem. xfs A high-performance filesystem originally developed by Silicon Graphics, excellent for handling large files. gfs2 A shared-disk filesystem that allows multiple computers to use a shared disk to communicate without going through a network filesystem layer, such as CIFS, NFS, etc. Enter man fs to learn more about Linux filesystem-related information.\n12.4.2 Enabling Swap Space 1 2 3 4 5 6 # View the number of swap partitions free -m # Create a swap partition mkswap /var/opt/myswap # Enable the swap partition swapon /var/opt/myswap If you\u0026rsquo;ve added a swap partition entry to /etc/fstab, such as:\n/var/opt/myswap swap swap defaults 0 0\nYou can enable it using swapon -a.\n12.4.3 Disabling Swap Space swapoff /var/opt/myswap\n12.4.4 Defining Mountable Filesystems with fstab As introduced in 12.2.3, the second field can use UUID instead of the device name, because device names can change.\nView UUIDs: blkid\n12.4.5 Mounting Filesystems with the mount Command Also introduced in 12.2.3.\n12.4.6 Mounting Disk Images in Loopback Mode This involves mounting an ISO image file.\n1 2 3 4 # Create a mount directory mkdir /mnt/tmp # Mount mount -o loop name.iso /mnt/tmp 12.4.7 Using the umount Command You can specify either the device partition name or the directory name.\nDevice partition name: umount /dev/sdb1\nDirectory name: umount /mnt/tmp\nTypically, it\u0026rsquo;s better to use the directory name.\nIf a directory is busy and cannot be unmounted, you can:\nLazy unmount: umount -l Force unmount: umount -f 12.5 Managing Storage with Cockpit GUI. Refer to Chapter 8 for activation.\n","date":"2023-01-03T13:37:48+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/85/","title":"Learning Linux Chapter 12: Managing Disks and Filesystems"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Chapter 11: Managing User Accounts User accounts maintain the boundary between the people using the system and the processes running within it. Groups are a method for assigning system permissions to multiple users at once.\n11.1 Creating User Accounts Everyone using a Linux system should have a separate user account. Having an account provides a dedicated area for storing files and allows for personalizing the user interface (GUI, paths, environment variables, etc.) to suit individual habits.\nYou can use the Cockpit GUI to create accounts. If it\u0026rsquo;s not installed:\n1 2 yum install cockpit -y systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket Then open localhost:9090 in your browser to manage it.\n11.1.1 Adding Users with the useradd Command In most cases, using a GUI is a hassle. You can use the useradd command instead (requires root). The only mandatory parameter is the login name. Useful options include:\nOption Description -c \u0026ldquo;comment\u0026rdquo; Provides a description of the new account. Usually the user\u0026rsquo;s full name. -d home_dir Sets the home directory. Defaults to /home/loginname. -D Doesn\u0026rsquo;t create an account; instead, saves provided info as defaults for future users. -e expire_date Sets an expiration date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Example: -e 2024-08-01 -f -1 Days after password expiration before the account is locked. -1 disables this. -g group Sets the primary group (must exist in /etc/group). Otherwise, a new group with the username is created. -G grouplist Adds the user to supplementary groups (comma-separated). Example: -G wheel, sales, tech -k skel_dir Files for the home directory, copied from skel_dir (default is /etc/skel). -m Automatically creates the home directory. Default on Fedora/RHEL, but not on Ubuntu. -M Do NOT create the home directory, even if -m is specified. -n Disables the default behavior of creating a group matching the username/UID. -o Used with -u uid to create an account with a non-unique UID. -p passwd Sets the password (must be MD5 hashed). If skipped, use passwd user later. Use openssl passwd for MD5 output. -s shell Sets the default shell. Example: -s /bin/csh -u user_id Specifies a UID. If omitted, it\u0026rsquo;s auto-assigned. Regular users start at 1000. Standard usage:\n1 2 3 # As root useradd yexca passwd yexca When creating the yexca account, useradd does the following:\nReads /etc/login.defs and /etc/default/useradd for default values. Checks command-line arguments to see which defaults were overridden. Creates new user entries in /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow. Creates a new group entry in /etc/group. Creates a home directory in /home based on the username. Copies files from /etc/skel to the new home directory (usually login and app startup scripts). A typical entry in /etc/passwd:\nyexca:x:1001:1001::/home/yexca:/bin/bash\nFields are colon-separated: login name, password, UID, primary GID, comment, home directory, and default shell.\nThe x in the password field means the actual encrypted password is stored in /etc/shadow.\nA typical entry in /etc/group:\nyexca:x:1001:\nFields: group name, group password, GID, and a list of users in the group.\n11.1.2 Setting User Defaults useradd determines defaults by reading /etc/login.defs and /etc/default/useradd. You can modify these files to change default behavior.\nIn different Linux distros, login.defs varies. Here are some common ones:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 PASS_MAX_DAYS 99999 PASS_MIN_DAYS 0 PASS_MIN_LEN 5 PASS_WARN_AGE 7 UID_MIN 1000 UID_MAX 60000 SYS_UID_MIN 200 SYS_UID_MAX 999 GID_MIN 1000 GID_MAX 60000 SYS_GID_MIN 201 SYS_GID_MAX 999 CREATE_HOME yes To see other defaults, check /etc/default/useradd or run useradd -D.\nYou can use -D with other options to modify /etc/default/useradd:\n-b default_home — Set the base directory for home directories (usually /home). -e default_expire_date — Set the default account expiration date (YYYY-MM-DD). -f default_inactive — Set days after password expiry before an account is disabled. -g default_group — Set the default primary group. Usually, a new group with the same name/ID is created anyway. -s default_shell — Default shell. 11.1.3 Modifying Users with usermod The usermod command is a straightforward way to change account parameters.\nOption Description -c \u0026ldquo;username\u0026rdquo; Changes the comment/description. -d home_dir Changes the home directory. -e expire_date Assigns a new expiration date (YYYY-MM-DD). -f -1 Changes days after password expiry before permanent lock. -1 disables it. -g group Changes the primary group (group must exist). -G grouplist Sets supplementary groups. Use -Ga to append to existing groups. -l login_name Changes the login name. -L Locks the account (adds an \u0026lsquo;!\u0026rsquo; before the encrypted password in /etc/shadow). -m Moves content from old home to new home. Only works with -d. -o Used with -u to allow non-unique UIDs. -s shell Changes the shell. -u user_id Changes the UID. -U Unlocks the account (removes the \u0026lsquo;!\u0026rsquo; in /etc/shadow). 11.1.4 Deleting Users with userdel The command userdel -r yexca deletes the user from /etc/passwd. The -r flag ensures the home directory /home/yexca is also removed.\nBefore deleting, it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to find any orphaned files using find: find / -user yexca -ls or find / -uid 1001 -ls.\nFiles not assigned to a user can be a security risk. You should assign them to a real account. Use find / -nouser -ls to find files not associated with any existing user.\n11.2 Understanding Group Accounts Groups are useful for sharing a set of files among multiple users.\nUse the chgrp grpName fileOrDir command to change the group ownership of a file or directory.\n11.2.1 Using Group Accounts Every user is assigned to a primary group, indicated by the fourth field in the /etc/passwd entry.\nA user can belong to multiple supplementary groups or none at all. If user yexca is a member of groups yexca and hi, the entries in /etc/group look like this:\nyexca:x:1001:yexca\nhi:x:1002:yexca\nOnly root can change group memberships; regular users can\u0026rsquo;t change their own groups or add others to their groups.\nIf you want to create a file as a specific group, use the newgrp command to temporarily switch your effective group.\nUsers with root privileges can use gpasswd to set a password for a group.\n11.2.2 Creating Group Accounts Create: groupadd groupName\nAssign GID: groupadd -g gid groupName\nTo modify a group, use the group name or GID:\ngroupmod -g gid userName\ngroupmod -n groupName userName\nTo change supplementary groups, use the usermod command mentioned earlier.\n11.3 Managing Users in the Enterprise ACL (Access Control Lists) technology allows you to assign specific permissions for files or directories to any user or group.\n11.3.1 Setting Permissions with ACLs Two main commands: setfacl to set and getfacl to view directory permissions.\nWhen setting, use -m to modify or -x to remove permissions. For example:\nsetfacl -m u:userName:rwx filename\n11.3.2 Adding Collaboration Directories for Users When using chmod, there\u0026rsquo;s a special set of three permission bits often ignored. These set special permissions on commands and directories.\nExample: chmod 775 /home/yexca/tmp.txt is actually 0775.\nName Value Letter Set UID (SUID) 4 u+s Set GID (SGID) 2 g+s Sticky Bit 1 o+t Creating a Group Collaboration Directory (Setting the GID bit) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 # Create a group for collaboration groupadd -g 301 cooperation # Add users usermod -aG cooperation yexca # Create the directory mkdir /mnt/co-tmp # Assign the group to the directory chgrp cooperation /mnt/co-tmp # Change directory permissions chmod 2775 /mnt/co-tmp # The permissions should now appear as rwxrwsr-x Now, if user yexca creates a file in /mnt/co-tmp, the file\u0026rsquo;s group will be cooperation instead of yexca.\nCreating a Restricted Deletion Directory (Sticky Bit) Command: chmod 1775 /mnt/tmp\nIn a restricted deletion directory, only the root user or the file owner can delete a file, even if others have write permissions.\nThe /tmp directory is a classic example of this (permissions are rwxrwxrwt).\nSet UID (SUID)\nAn executable with the SUID bit set (rwsr-xr-x) means that when others execute it, the process runs with the permissions of the file\u0026rsquo;s owner.\nExample: The su command. All users can run it, but the resulting process belongs to root.\n11.4 Centralized User Accounts By default, Linux authenticates users against /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow. However, you can use other methods.\nExamples include LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), NIS (Network Information Service), Winbind, and more.\n","date":"2023-01-02T12:29:03+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/84/","title":"Linux Learning Chapter 11: Managing User Accounts"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Chapter 10: Getting and Managing Software 10.1 Managing Software on the Desktop Manage via software centers and GUIs.\n10.2 Beyond the Software Window The software available in the GUI \u0026ldquo;Software\u0026rdquo; app is limited.\n10.3 Understanding Linux RPM and DEB Packages Software packages are often called tarballs (compressed archives). They contain executables (commands), documentation, configuration files, and libraries.\nDEB (.deb) Packages Created by the Debian GNU/Linux project. Used by Debian and its derivatives (Ubuntu, Linux Mint, KNOPPIX, etc.). Use apt or dpkg commands to install, manage, update, and remove software.\nRPM (.rpm) Packages Originally the Red Hat Package Manager, now known as the RPM Package Manager. It\u0026rsquo;s the preferred format for SUSE, Red Hat distributions (RHEL, Fedora), and others based on Red Hat (CentOS, Oracle Linux, etc.). Managed via the original rpm command, the enhanced yum, or the modern dnf command.\nyum is eventually being replaced by the dnf command.\n10.3.1 Understanding DEB Packages Debian packages store files and metadata related to the software in an archive format. Files include executables, configs, and other project items. Metadata includes dependencies, licenses, size, descriptions, etc.\nUse apt* commands to fetch (apt-get), search (apt-cache search), view details (apt-cache show), install (apt-get install), upgrade (apt-get upgrade), or list installed software (apt-cache pkgnames).\nUse the aptitude command for a screen-oriented menu inside the shell to install software.\n10.3.2 Understanding RPM Packages An RPM package merges different files, each providing a specific function. Inside are the commands, configs, and docs that make up the software, plus metadata (content info, source, runtime requirements, etc.).\nUse rpm -q -i packageName to view info about a specific software.\n10.4 Managing RPM Packages with yum 10.4.1 Transitioning from yum to dnf DNF stands for Dandified yum https://github.com/rpm-software-management/dnf/ .\nWhile dnf maintains basic command-line compatibility with yum, a key difference is its strict API and encouragement of extensions and plugins.\nThe following yum commands can all be used as dnf commands.\nFor more info on dnf, see https://dnf.readthedocs.io/ .\n10.4.2 How yum Works Basic syntax: yum [options] command\nExample: Installing Firefox: yum install firefox\nChecking /etc/yum.conf Inside this file:\ngpgcheck: Whether to verify packages.\ninstallonly_limit=3: Max versions of the same package to keep (don\u0026rsquo;t set below 2 to ensure you always have at least two kernel packages).\nclean_requirements_on_remove=True: Remove dependencies when uninstalling (if no other software uses them).\nbest=True: Prioritize the latest version when upgrading.\ncachedir: Cache location.\nkeepcache: Whether to keep the cache.\ndebuglevel: Logging detail level (higher is more detailed).\nmetadata_expire: Metadata timeout.\nFor details, use man yum.conf.\nChecking /etc/yum.repos.d/*.repo files To enable a repository, place the .repo file here. Content looks like:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 [myrepo] # Start, repo name in `[]` name=My repo # Detailed description baseurl=https://rpmrepo.yexca.net/ # Fictional URL # RPM URLs can be http://, ftp://, file:// enabled=1 # Enable this repo (defaults to enabled if omitted) gpgcheck=1 # Check package signatures gpgkey=file:///etc/MYKEY # Path to the key for checking packages You can enable any number of repos, but yum checks every single one every time it runs, downloading metadata to the local system. Don\u0026rsquo;t enable too many.\nDownloading RPM packages and metadata from YUM repos There is a repodata directory in the rpm directory, summarizing all enabled repos.\nMetadata is stored in /var/cache/yum. It refreshes after the timeout (default 6h for yum, 48h for dnf).\nInstalling RPM packages to the Linux filesystem Once downloaded to cache, yum runs the rpm command to install. It executes any pre-install scripts, copies files (commands, configs, docs) to locations specified by RPM metadata, and runs post-install scripts.\nStoring YUM repo metadata in the local RPM database Metadata from each repo is eventually copied to the local RPM database, stored in several files within /var/lib/rpm.\n10.4.3 Using yum with Third-party Repos For stability, use official repos. For convenience on a personal machine, you can enable the RPM Fusion third-party repo. See https://rpmfusion.org/ .\n10.4.4 Managing Software with yum Commands Searching for packages yum search keyword\nGet detailed info yum info firefox\nIf you know the command, config, or library name but not the package name: yum provides keyword\nListing packages using the list subcommand: yum list firefox\nyum list available\nyum list installed\nyum list all\nView dependencies and providers: yum deplist firefox | less\nInstalling and Removing Packages install installs one or more packages plus dependencies. yum install firefox or yum -y install firefox for non-interactive installation.\nreinstall to fix a broken installation. yum reinstall firefox\nremove deletes software and unused dependencies. yum remove firefox\nAlternatively, use history to rollback.\nUse yum history to view logs, yum history info 12 for details on ID 12, and yum history undo 12 to revert transaction 12.\nUpdating Packages yum check-update to see what\u0026rsquo;s new, yum update to update everything, yum update firefox to update only Firefox.\nUpdating Package Groups yum supports package groups for easier management of full environments.\nyum grouplist | less to see groups.\nyum groupinfo LXDE to see packages in the LXDE group.\nyum groupinstall LXDE to install the whole group.\nyum groupremove LXDE to remove the whole group.\nMaintaining RPM Database and Cache yum clean packages to remove downloaded installers.\nyum clean metadata to clear metadata.\nyum clean all\nIf the RPM database gets corrupted (rare):\nyum check to inspect the cache and DB.\nrpm --rebuilddb to rebuild the database.\nNote: rpm is generally the best command for interacting with the local RPM database.\nDownloading RPMs from YUM Repos Download without installing to the current directory:\nyumdownloader firefox\ndnf download firefox\n10.5 Installing, Querying, and Verifying with the rpm Command Mostly used for local package files.\n10.5.1 Installing and Removing with rpm Install rpm -i packageName\nRequires the full filename (basename, version, kernel, etc.).\nUpgrade rpm -Uhv packageName\n-h prints # marks (progress), -v provides verbose output.\nFreshen (Update only if already installed) rpm -Fhv *.rpm\nReinstall rpm -Uhv --replacepkgs packageName\nDowngrade rpm -Uhv --oldpackage packageName\nRemove Only requires the basename (e.g., firefox).\nrpm -e firefox\nNote: This doesn\u0026rsquo;t remove dependencies.\n10.5.2 Querying RPM Info Use the -q option to query info about installed packages, like description (-qi), file list (-ql), or config files (-qc).\nUse the basename: rpm -qi firefox\nOther queries: dependencies (-q --requires), provided capabilities (-q --provides), install/uninstall scripts (-q --scripts), and the changelog (-q --changelog).\nUse --queryformat for specific tags and --querytags to see all available tags.\nThese query the local DB. To query a local file (not yet installed), add the -p option and use the full filename: rpm -qip zsh-5.7.1-1.fc30.x86_64.rpm\n10.5.3 Verifying RPM Packages Use the -V option to check installed packages against the original metadata to see if anything changed.

These items are saved in a plain text file that can be executed as a command.\nSimilar to batch files (.bat) in Windows.\n7.1.1 Executing and Debugging Shell Scripts The main advantage of shell scripts is that you can open them in any text editor to view the contents. The biggest drawback is that large or complex scripts usually run slower than compiled programs. There are two basic ways to run a shell script:\nPass the script name as an argument to the shell, for example: bash myscript\nAdd the interpreter name (#!/bin/bash) to the first line, grant execution permissions (chmod +x myscript), and run it by specifying the path, for example: (./myscript.sh)\nArguments following the script name on the command line are passed as parameters.\nComments start with #\nYou can add set -x at the beginning of the script or use $ bash -x myscript to display the commands being executed.\n7.1.2 Understanding Shell Variables Variable names in the shell are case-sensitive. Note that there should be no spaces around the equals sign (=) during definition, for example:\nNAME=value\nYou can assign constants such as text, numbers, and underscores to variables.\nYou can also assign the output of a command to a variable, for example: MYDATE=$(date) assigns the output of the date command to the variable MYDATE.\nThis way, every time MYDATE is used, the date command result is assigned. You can use single quotes ' if you want the result of the command at the time of assignment.\nSpecial shell characters: dollar sign ($), quotes ('), asterisk (*), exclamation mark (!), etc.\nIf you want to display $HOME in the terminal, you need to escape the $. Use echo '$HOME' or echo \\$HOME. Specifically:\nIf you want the shell to interpret a single character literally, use a backslash \\.\nIf you want to interpret a group of characters literally, wrap them in single quotes (').\nIf you want to interpret only part of a group of characters literally, use double quotes (\u0026quot;). Inside double quotes, the dollar sign ($), quotes ('), and exclamation mark (!) are still interpreted, but other characters (like the asterisk *) are not.\nTo assign a value, use the variable name directly. To reference it (get its value), prefix the name with a dollar sign ($).\nExample: Assigning one variable\u0026rsquo;s value to another: newVar=\u0026quot;$oldVar\u0026quot;\nSpecial Shell Positional Parameters Positional parameters, or command-line arguments, are named $0, $1, $2\u0026hellip;$n.\n$0 is the name of the script being called, while the others are assigned the values passed from the command line. For example:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 #!/bin/bash echo \u0026#34;The first parameter is $1, the second is $2\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;The script name is $0\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;Total parameters passed: $#\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;All parameters are: $@\u0026#34; Executing ./myscript hello bye results in:\n1 2 3 4 The first parameter is hello, the second is bye The script name is /home/yexca/tmp/myscript Total parameters passed: 2 All parameters are: hello bye Another useful parameter is $?, which captures the exit status of the last executed command. Usually, a normal exit returns 0.\nReading Parameters Use the read command to get user input.\n1 2 3 4 #!/bin/bash read -p \u0026#34;Please enter two nouns: \u0026#34; var1 var2 echo \u0026#34;You entered $var1 and $var2\u0026#34; Parameter Expansion in Bash To get a variable\u0026rsquo;s value, use the dollar sign ($), e.g., $var. This is shorthand for ${var}.\nBash has rules for expanding parameter values in different ways. Here are common ones using ${var} as an example:\nExample Description ${var:-value} If variable is unset or empty, expand to \u0026ldquo;value\u0026rdquo; ${var#pattern} Strip the shortest match of pattern from the front of var\u0026rsquo;s value ${var##pattern} Strip the longest match of pattern from the front of var\u0026rsquo;s value ${var%pattern} Strip the shortest match of pattern from the end of var\u0026rsquo;s value ${var%%pattern} Strip the longest match of pattern from the end of var\u0026rsquo;s value These features allow for useful applications:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 myFileName=/home/yexca/myfile.txt # file becomes myfile.txt file=${myFileName##*/} # dir becomes /home/yexca dir=${myFileName%/*} # name becomes myfile name=${file%.*} # extension becomes txt extension=${file##*.} 7.1.3 Performing Arithmetic in Shell Scripts Bash uses untyped variables. Unless you use declare, variables are treated as strings. They automatically convert to integers during calculations; no need to specify types during assignment.\nYou can use the built-in let command, the external expr command, or the bc command for integer math.\nExamples: let result=$num/16 or let num=$RANDOM.\nThere are also increment operators: i++ and ++i.\nThe let command requires no spaces between operands and operators.\nThe expr command requires spaces between operands and operators.\nThe bc command has no space requirements and can handle floating-point math.\n7.1.4 Using Programming Structures in Shell Scripts \u0026ldquo;if\u0026hellip;then\u0026rdquo; Statement 1 2 3 if [ $var -eq 1 ]; then echo \u0026#34;The var is 1\u0026#34; fi For numbers, -eq works well. For comparing string values, the equals sign (=) is better.\n1 2 3 if [ $str = \u0026#34;hello\u0026#34; ]; then echo \u0026#34;hello\u0026#34; fi There is also the inequality operator !=.\nUse elif for more options and else for the default case.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 str=\u0026#34;$HOME\u0026#34; if [ -f \u0026#34;$str\u0026#34; ]; then echo \u0026#34;$str is a regular file\u0026#34; elif [ -d \u0026#34;$str\u0026#34; ]; then echo \u0026#34;$str is a directory\u0026#34; else echo \u0026#34;???\u0026#34; fi Common test conditions:\nOperator What it tests -a file Does file exist (same as -e) -b file Is file a block special device -c file Is file a character special device (serial lines, terminals) -d file Is file a directory -e file Does file exist (same as -a) -f file Does file exist and is it a regular file (not a directory, socket, pipe, link, etc.) -g file Does file have the SGID bit set -h file Is file a symbolic link (same as -L) -k file Does file have the sticky bit set -L file Is file a symbolic link (same as -h) -n string Is string length greater than 0 -O file Do you own the file -p file Is file a named pipe -r file Is file readable -s file Does file exist and is it larger than 0 bytes -S file Does file exist and is it a socket -t file Is file descriptor connected to a terminal -u file Does file have the SUID bit set -w file Is file writable -x file Is file executable -z string Is string length 0 Comparing two variables:\nOperator What it tests expr1 -a expr2 Are both expressions true expr1 -o expr2 Is either expression true file1 -nt file2 Is file1 newer than file2 (modification time) file1 -ot file2 Is file1 older than file2 (modification time) file1 -ef file2 Are both files linked (hard or symbolic link) var1 = var2 Does var1 equal var2 var1 -eq var2 Does var1 equal var2 (integer) var1 -ge var2 Is var1 greater than or equal to var2 var1 -gt var2 Is var1 greater than var2 var1 -le var2 Is var1 less than or equal to var2 var1 -lt var2 Is var1 less than var2 var1 != var2 Does var1 not equal var2 var1 -ne var2 Does var1 not equal var2 (integer) You can also combine test operators with \u0026amp;\u0026amp; and || for logic similar to C\u0026rsquo;s ternary operator.\nC: a\u0026gt;b ? a : b\nShell: [ $a -gt $b ] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; echo $a || echo $b\nStandalone examples: [ $a -eq $b ] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; echo $a returns $a if a equals b.\n[ -d \u0026quot;$dirName\u0026quot; ] || mkdir \u0026quot;$dirName\u0026quot; creates the directory if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist.\ncase Command Similar to switch in C, used for selection.

Most are designed to work with standard input/output.\nGeneral Regular Expression Parser (grep) A tool for finding patterns in files or text. Use it for searching.\nFormat: grep [pattern] [input]\nCheck man grep for more.\nRemoving Sections of Text (cut) cut extracts fields from text or files. For example:\ngrep /home /etc/passwd | cut -d':' -f6\nFirst, grep gets lines from /etc/passwd containing /home, then cut splits those lines using : as a delimiter and takes the sixth field (-f6).\nTranslating or Deleting Characters (tr) tr is a character-based translator used to replace or delete characters.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 # Convert uppercase to lowercase FOO=\u0026#34;AbcDEF\u0026#34; echo $FOO | tr [A-Z] [a-z] # Replace spaces with underscores in filenames for file in *; do f=$(echo \u0026#34;$file\u0026#34; | tr [:blank:] [_]) [ \u0026#34;$file\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;$f\u0026#34; ] || mv -i -- \u0026#34;$file\u0026#34; \u0026#34;$f\u0026#34; done Stream Editor (sed) sed is a simple script editor for tasks like deleting lines matching a pattern or replacing strings.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s complex; refer to online documentation for details.\n7.1.6 Using a Simple Shell Script A phone list example:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 #!/bin/bash # (@)/ph # A very simple telephone list # Type \u0026#34;ph new name number\u0026#34; to add to the list, or # just type \u0026#34;ph name\u0026#34; to get a phone number PHONELIST=~/.phonelist.txt # If no command line parameters ($#), there # is a problem, so ask what they\u0026#39;re talking about. if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then echo \u0026#34;Whose phone number did you want? \u0026#34; exit 1 fi # Did you want to add a new phone number? if [ $1 = \u0026#34;new\u0026#34; ]; then shift echo $* \u0026gt;\u0026gt; $PHONELIST echo $* added to database exit 0 fi # Nope.

If an input is H (High), connect from its original line (first column). Then, connect these to an AND gate. Repeat this for all underlined entries from step 2.\nConnect all AND gate outputs to an OR gate.\nCircuit Simplification Digital circuit design flow: Problem definition -\u0026gt; Truth table -\u0026gt; Simplification -\u0026gt; Circuit diagram.\nSimplify using Karnaugh Maps (K-maps).\nConvert the truth table into a K-map. When building the truth table, columns usually start with the most significant bit, e.g., [C, B, A], with the result Z. A K-map is a 2D truth table, typically using 0s and 1s for logic levels. For three inputs, you might use B, A for rows/columns and C for the other axis, then fill the 2D table with the results.\nK-map Basics for Simplification K-maps wrap around horizontally and vertically because adjacent cells (including wrap-around) differ by only one bit.\nSimplification Process\nGroup adjacent 1s together. Find commonalities among the variables within each group (rows and columns). If a common variable\u0026rsquo;s value is 0, use its complement (e.g., A becomes !A). Example\nC\\BA 00 01 11 10 0 1 1 1 In the table above, the commonalities are C=0 and A=1, so the expression is !C * A.\nSimplification Rules\nGroups must be rectangular (or square) with sides of length 1, 2, or 4. Groups can overlap. Aim for the fewest, largest possible groups. Note: Groups can span across the edges (left-right, top-bottom wrap-around). If no further groups can be formed, the circuit is as simplified as possible.\nAfter simplification, draw the circuit diagram. Just follow the circuit drawing steps (starting from step 3 in the previous section) for all derived expressions.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Cares in Circuits When defining inputs, due to the nature of binary numbers, there might be \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t care\u0026rdquo; inputs that don\u0026rsquo;t need consideration.\nFor instance, if inputs represent months (1-12) using four binary bits, there are 16 possible inputs. Numbers like 0, 13, 14, and 15 are \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t cares\u0026rdquo; because they\u0026rsquo;re invalid month values.\nThese \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t care\u0026rdquo; inputs can be represented by \u0026lsquo;-\u0026rsquo; in a K-map and can be included in groups to further simplify the expression.\nBuilding Sequential Circuits Sequential circuits require both combinational logic and flip-flops.\nRegarding the \u0026ldquo;memory\u0026rdquo; in sequential circuits: Think of a vending machine. It remembers the total amount inserted. Without memory, it would only recognize the last coin\u0026rsquo;s value.\nA flip-flop, like a clock (CLK), is introduced. Inputs only affect outputs when the CLK is triggered; otherwise, the output remains unchanged.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take drawing an electronic die as an example.\nDraw the state transition diagram. How does the electronic die change over time? If \u0026ldquo;stop\u0026rdquo; is low, it cycles from 1 to 6, then back to 1. If \u0026ldquo;stop\u0026rdquo; is high, it stays at a specific point.\nRepresent states using binary numbers. Represent each situation or state using binary, then create a state transition table. Design the circuit from the state transition table, using D flip-flops to store states.\nDesign the combinational circuit. Determining the next state from the current state is, essentially, a combinational circuit.\n","date":"2022-12-04T16:54:29+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/80/","title":"My Thoughts on \"Manga Guide to Digital Electronics\""},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Chapter 6: Managing Running Processes Linux is a multi-user, multi-tasking operating system. Multi-tasking means multiple programs can run simultaneously. An instance of a running program is called a process.\nYou can start, pause, stop, or kill processes via the shell. You can also move processes to the background or bring them to the foreground.\n6.1 Understanding Processes A process is a running instance of a command. Every process in the system is identified by a Process ID (PID), which is unique to the current system. Besides the PID, a process is associated with a specific user account and group, which determines the system resources the process can access.\nCommands used to display process information primarily pull raw data from the /proc file system. Each process stores its information in a subdirectory within /proc named after its PID.\n6.2 Listing Processes Use the ps command or the top command. The top command provides a more screen-oriented way to list processes.\n6.2.1 Using the ps Command Using ps u displays the username and other detailed information.\nVSZ: Virtual Set Size. Shows the size of the process image in KB.\nRSS: Resident Set Size. Shows the size of the program in physical memory.\nVSZ is the amount of memory allocated to the process, while RSS is the amount of memory the process is actually using (representing physical memory that cannot be swapped).\nSTAT column: S indicates a sleeping process, R indicates a running process, and + indicates the process is associated with a foreground operation.\nView all processes for the current user: ps ux | less\nView processes for all users: ps aux | less\nYou can also customize the output columns and sort them. For example:\n1 ps -eo pid,user,uid,group,gid,vsz,rss,comm --sort=-vsz | less -e displays every running process, -o specifies the columns to display (where comm is the command name), and --sort=-vsz sorts by the VSZ column in descending order.\n6.2.2 Using the top Command The top command defaults to displaying processes sorted by current CPU usage percentage.\nOperations within the top command:\nCommand Description h Help M Sort by memory usage 1 Toggle display of all CPU usage (for multi-CPU systems) R Reverse sort order u Enter a username to show only that user\u0026rsquo;s processes r Change process priority (nice value) k Kill a process (kill command) 6.2.3 Using System Monitor A GUI tool for the GNOME desktop.\n6.3 Managing Background and Foreground Processes On systems without a GUI, you must use the shell for all operations. Although the Bash shell doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a GUI to manage programs, you can move active programs between the foreground and background. This allows you to run many programs and switch to the one you need to handle.\n6.3.1 Starting Background Processes To put a command in the background:\nAppend an \u0026amp; to the end of the command.\nUse the at command to run commands later.\nFor a running process, press Ctrl+Z to stop it, then type fg to bring it to the foreground or bg to start it running in the background.\nTo prevent background output from cluttering your foreground work, redirect it to the null device: 2\u0026gt;/dev/null.\nUse the jobs command to view background jobs (use -l to see PIDs). A + next to a job number indicates the most recent background job, while - indicates the job placed in the background just before the most recent one.\n6.3.2 Using Foreground and Background Commands To reference a background job, use % followed by the job number (from the jobs output). Other ways to reference jobs:\n% — References the most recent background job (the one with the +).\n%string — Job starting with \u0026ldquo;string\u0026rdquo; (must be unique).\n%?string — Job containing \u0026ldquo;string\u0026rdquo; anywhere in the command line (must be unique).\n%-- — References the job placed in the background before the most recent one (the one with the -).\nUse fg %1 to bring job #1 to the foreground. Use bg %5 to resume a stopped job #5 in the background.\nNote: The vi command stops automatically when moved to the background. Remember to save your file before backgrounding it to avoid data loss.\n6.4 Killing and Modifying Processes You can send different signals to a process to change its behavior or modify its processor priority.\n6.4.1 Using kill and killall While these commands are often used to terminate a process, they actually send signals. Signals are represented by numbers or names.\nSignal Number Description SIGHUP 1 Reread configuration files SIGINT 2 Interrupt via keyboard (Ctrl+C) SIGQUIT 3 Quit via keyboard SIGABRT 6 Abort signal generated by abort(3) SIGKILL 9 Kill signal (cannot be ignored) SIGTERM 15 Termination signal (default) SIGCONT 19, 18, 25 Continue a stopped process SIGSTOP 17, 19, 23 Stop a process For the last two signals, the first value applies to Alpha and SPARC, the middle to x86, and the last to MIPS architectures.\nThe default is the SIGTERM (15) signal. While processes can handle or ignore various signals, no process can block SIGKILL (9) or SIGSTOP.\nUsing kill to send a signal via PID: 1 kill [signal] [PID] Example: Killing process 2333: kill -9 2333 or kill -SIGKILL 2333.\nUsing killall to send a signal by name: Useful for killing multiple processes with the same name, but be careful not to kill essential processes accidentally.\nExample: Restarting gnome-shell: killall -1 gnome-shell\n6.4.2 Setting Processor Priority with nice and renice When the Linux kernel decides which process gets CPU time, it considers the \u0026ldquo;nice\u0026rdquo; value, ranging from -20 to 19. The default is 0.\nA lower nice value means higher priority. Only the root user can set negative values (increase priority). Normal users can only increase the nice value (decrease priority).\nUse the nice command to start a process with a specific priority, or renice to change the priority of an already running process by PID.\nnice -n +5 updatedb \u0026amp; runs the updatedb command in the background with a priority offset of +5.\nrenice -n 3 2333 changes the nice value of PID 2333 to 3.\n6.5 Limiting Processes with cgroups A nice value set for a process does not necessarily apply to its child processes. In other words, nice cannot limit the total amount of system resources a specific user or application can use.\nYou can use cgroups (control groups) to define a process as a \u0026ldquo;task\u0026rdquo; within a specific control group. You can set up tasks in a hierarchy, including \u0026ldquo;daemon\u0026rdquo; tasks (setting default limits for background servers) and sub-tasks with specific limits for things like httpd or vsftpd.\nWhen a task starts a process, the child process inherits the parent\u0026rsquo;s limits. These limits can cover storage, processor scheduling, process reporting, CPU allocation, device access, and memory usage.\nConfiguring cgroups can be complex, involving editing /etc/cgconfig.conf to create groups or /etc/cgrules.conf to limit specific users/groups. You can use the cgcreate command to add groups to the /sys/fs/cgroup hierarchy. Warning: incorrect settings may prevent the system from booting.\n","date":"2022-12-03T15:07:03+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/79/","title":"Linux Learning Chapter 6: Managing Running Processes"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Chapter 5: Working with Text Files Most Linux configuration is done by editing plain text files. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re modifying files in the /etc directory to configure local services or editing Ansible playbooks to manage hosts, plain text files are everywhere in these tasks.\n5.1 Editing Files with vim and vi vim is an improved version of vi. They work similarly, but vim includes features like tutorials and syntax highlighting. I recommend using vim.\nIn fact, in many Linux distributions, vi is just an alias for vim. Running alias vi usually outputs alias vi='vim', though the root user often doesn\u0026rsquo;t have this alias set.\nOther text editors exist in Linux, such as nano, gedit, jed, joe, kate, kedit, mcedit, and nedit. Among these, jed and joe are common for plain text.\n5.1.1 Getting Started with vi vi has three modes: the primary ones are Command Mode and Input Mode, plus Ex Mode. By default, you enter a file in Command Mode (after running the vi file command).\nCommand Mode means you need to enter a command (one or two letters, sometimes with optional numeric parameters) to tell vi what you want to do before you can change any text.\nNote: Commands are case-sensitive.\nAdding Text To enter Input Mode, type an input command letter.\nCommand Description a Append command. Enter text to the right of the cursor. A Append at the end of the line. Start entering text at the end. i Insert command. Enter text to the left of the cursor. I Insert at the beginning of the line. Start at the start of the line. o Open below. Open a new line below the current one and enter Insert Mode. O Open above. Insert a new line above the current one and enter Insert Mode. Once in Insert Mode, --INSERT-- will appear at the bottom of the screen.\nAfter finishing your input, press Esc to return to Command Mode (sometimes you might need to press it twice).\nMoving in Text Use these keys to move a single character:\nKey Description Arrow Keys Up, Down, Left, Right h, j, k, l Left, Down, Up, Right Backspace, Space Left, Right Commands for moving multiple characters:\nCommand Description w Move to the start of the next word (separated by space, tab, or punctuation). W Move to the start of the next word (separated by space or tab). b Move to the start of the previous word (space, tab, or punctuation). B Move to the start of the previous word (space or tab). 0 (zero) Move to the start of the current line. $ Move to the end of the current line. H Move to the top-left of the screen (first line on screen). M Move to the first character of the middle line on the screen. L Move to the bottom-left of the screen (last line on screen). Deleting, Copying, and Changing Text These commands can be combined with movement keys (arrows, PgUp, PgDn, letters) and numbers to specify exactly what to delete, copy, or change.\nCommand Description x Delete character under cursor X Delete character before cursor d\u003c?\u003e Delete some text c\u003c?\u003e Change some text y\u003c?\u003e Copy (yank) some text The \u0026lt;?\u0026gt; after each command represents the movement command used, for example:\ndw \u0026mdash; Delete one word after the cursor. db \u0026mdash; Delete one word before the cursor. dd \u0026mdash; Delete the entire current line. c$ \u0026mdash; Change from the current character to the end of the line (deletes then enters Input Mode). c0 \u0026mdash; Change from the character before the cursor to the start of the line. cl \u0026mdash; Delete current character and enter Input Mode. cc \u0026mdash; Delete current line and enter Input Mode. yy \u0026mdash; Copy the current line to the buffer. y) \u0026mdash; Copy the sentence to the right of the cursor to the buffer. y} \u0026mdash; Copy the paragraph to the right of the cursor to the buffer. You can also use numbers to modify these commands:\n3dd \u0026mdash; Delete 3 lines starting from the current line. 3dw \u0026mdash; Delete the next 3 words. 5cl \u0026mdash; Change the next 5 characters. 12j \u0026mdash; Move down 12 lines. 5cw \u0026mdash; Delete the next 5 words and enter Input Mode. 4y) \u0026mdash; Copy the next 4 sentences. Pasting (Placing) Text Place the last text stored in the buffer into the file.\nCommand Description P Paste to the left of the cursor; if a full line, paste above. p Paste to the right of the cursor; if a full line, paste below. Repeating Commands After deleting, changing, or pasting text, use . to repeat the action. For example, after replacing \u0026ldquo;Joe\u0026rdquo; with \u0026ldquo;Jim\u0026rdquo; (cw), find the next occurrence and press . to repeat the change.\nExiting vi In Command Mode, use ZZ to save and exit. Alternatively, press : to enter Ex Mode.\nCommand Description :w Save the current file without exiting. :wq Save and exit (same as ZZ). :q Exit, but only works if no changes were made. :q! Force exit without saving changes. Other Commands u \u0026mdash; Undo changes. Ctrl+R \u0026mdash; Redo (undoes the previous undo). :!command \u0026ndash; Run a shell command directly after :!, e.g., :!date to see the current date. You can even use :!bash to start a new shell, but it\u0026rsquo;s better to save your work first. Ctrl+g \u0026mdash; Displays the filename, current line number, total lines, percentage of file content, and current column. 5.1.2 Navigating Through Files If the file is long, use these methods to move faster:\nCommand Description Ctrl+f Page forward one full screen. Ctrl+b Page backward one full screen. Ctrl+d Scroll forward half a screen. Ctrl+u Scroll backward half a screen. G Go to the last line of the file. nG Go to line n. 5.1.3 Searching Text Search forward or backward using / and ?. You can also use metacharacters:\n/hello* \u0026mdash; Search forward for lines starting with \u0026ldquo;hello\u0026rdquo;. ?[pP]rint \u0026mdash; Search backward for \u0026ldquo;print\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Print\u0026rdquo;. After starting a search, use n or N to search in the same or opposite direction.\n5.1.4 Using Ex Mode The vi editor was originally based on the ex editor. While it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work in full-screen mode, you can use Ex Mode commands to find and change text on one or more lines.\nEnter Ex Mode from Command Mode using ::\n:g/Local \u0026mdash; Search for the word \u0026ldquo;Local\u0026rdquo; and print the relevant lines. :s/Local/Remote \u0026mdash; Replace the first occurrence of \u0026ldquo;Local\u0026rdquo; with \u0026ldquo;Remote\u0026rdquo; on the current line. :g/Local/s//Remote \u0026mdash; Replace the first \u0026ldquo;Local\u0026rdquo; on every line with \u0026ldquo;Remote\u0026rdquo;. :g/Local/s//Remote/g \u0026mdash; Replace every \u0026ldquo;Local\u0026rdquo; in the file with \u0026ldquo;Remote\u0026rdquo;. :g/Local/s//Remote/gp \u0026mdash; Replace every \u0026ldquo;Local\u0026rdquo; in the file and print each affected line. 5.1.5 Learning More Run vimtutor to open a built-in tutorial in the vim editor.\n5.2 Finding Files Use these commands to help locate files on your system:\nlocate \u0026mdash; Find files by name. find \u0026mdash; Find files based on various attributes. grep \u0026mdash; Search for specific text inside files. 5.2.1 Using locate to Find Files by Name Most Linux systems run the updatedb command daily to index filenames into a database. The locate command searches this database. You can manually update it with sudo updatedb. You can only see files that your user has permission to access via locate.\nlocate [str] or locate -i [str] to ignore case. For example, to search for directories containing \u0026ldquo;yexca\u0026rdquo; regardless of case: locate -i yexca.\nNote: Not all files are indexed; the /etc/updatedb.conf file determines which files are excluded from the database.\n5.2.2 Using find to Search for Files find is the most powerful command for searching the filesystem. It can find files based on attributes (metadata) and perform actions on the results.\nNote: File metadata includes owner, group, timestamps, size, permissions, and other info stored in the inode.\nfind vs locate\nfind searches the actual filesystem, so it\u0026rsquo;s slower than locate, but it provides real-time results (whereas locate might miss new files). When using find, specify a starting point to limit the scope and improve speed.\nThe find command has a special -ls option that lists detailed file info, similar to ls -l.\nNote: Regular users will see many errors due to permissions. You can redirect errors to /dev/null by adding 2\u0026gt;/dev/null to the end of the command.\nFinding files by name Use -name and -iname (case-insensitive) for filenames. You can use wildcards (* and ?):\n1 find /etc -iname \u0026#39;*passwd*\u0026#39; This searches /etc for files containing \u0026ldquo;passwd\u0026rdquo; (case-insensitive). If no directory is specified, it searches the current folder.\nUse the -type option to filter by files (-type f) or directories (-type d).\nFinding files by size Use the -size option with + or - prefixes. For example, find /etc -size +10M finds files in /etc larger than 10MB.\n1 find /bigdata -size +500M -size -5G -exec du -sh {} \\; This finds files between 500MB and 5GB in /bigdata and runs du on each to show their size.\nFinding files by user Use -user or -group. You can combine these with -not and -or.\n1 find /home \\( -user yexca -or -user lemon \\) -ls Finds files in /home owned by either yexca or lemon.\nFinding files by permissions Use the -perm option with numeric or symbolic modes.\n-perm -777: Matches if at least all three bits are set. -perm /777 (or +777 in older versions): Matches if any of the bits are set. -perm 777: Exact match. find -perm /002 finds files that are writable by \u0026ldquo;others,\u0026rdquo; regardless of other permissions.\nFinding files by date and time Time options (-atime, -ctime, -mtime) search based on days since access, change, or metadata modification. Minute options (-amin, -cmin, -mmin) do the same for minutes.\nPrefix the value with - for \u0026ldquo;less than\u0026rdquo; (from now until then) and + for \u0026ldquo;more than\u0026rdquo; (further back in time).\nChanges in the last 10 minutes: 1 find /etc -mmin -10 Permission changes in the last three days: 1 find /bin /usr/bin -ctime -3 Files not accessed for over 300 days: 1 find /var/www -atime +300 Using \u0026rsquo;not\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;or\u0026rsquo; logic Owned by yexca but not in the yexca group: 1 find /home -user yexca -not -group yexca -ls Owned by yexca AND larger than 1GB: 1 find /home -user yexca -and -size +1G -ls Executing commands on found files Use -exec to run a command on every match without confirmation, or -ok to ask for confirmation first. The syntax is:\n1 2 find [options] -exec command {} \\; find [options] -ok command {} \\; {} represents the found filename. The command must end with \\;.\n1 find /etc -iname passwd -exec echo \u0026#34;I found {}\u0026#34; \\; 5.2.3 Using grep to Search Inside Files grep searches for specific text strings within files. It can print the matching lines or just the filenames. grep also works with standard output.\nOption Description -i Ignore case. -v Search for lines NOT containing the text. -r Search directories recursively. -l Show only the names of matching files. \u0026ndash;color Highlight the matching text (usually in red). Recursively search for \u0026ldquo;root\u0026rdquo; in /etc/sysconfig: 1 grep -ri --color root /etc/sysconfig/ Search for \u0026ldquo;inet\u0026rdquo; in the output of a command: 1 ip addr show | grep inet ","date":"2022-11-19T21:07:03+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/78/","title":"Linux Learning Chapter 5: Working with Text Files"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash-lite Deploying on Windows 11.

These include terminals (tty*), hard drives (hd* or sd*), RAM (ram*), and CD-ROMs (cd*). Users can access devices directly via these files, though apps usually hide them. /etc Contains administrative configuration files. Most are plain text and can be edited with any text editor if you have the right permissions. /home Contains directories for every user with a login account (except root, which uses /root). /media A standard location for auto-mounting devices (especially removable media). Usually uses the volume name as the mount point. /lib Contains shared libraries needed by apps in /bin and /sbin to boot the system. /mnt Before /media became standard, /mnt was the common mount point for many devices. Some bootable Linux systems still use it for partitions and remote file systems. Many use it for temporary mounts. /misc Sometimes used for auto-mounting file systems on request. /opt Directory structure for storing add-on application software. /proc Contains information about system resources. /root The home directory for the root user. Kept separate from /home for security reasons. /sbin Contains administrative commands and daemons. /sys Contains parameters for tuning block storage and managing cgroups. /tmp Contains temporary files used by applications. /usr Contains user docs, games, graphics files (X11), libraries (lib), and other commands/files not needed during boot. Files in /usr are generally static after installation and can technically be mounted as read-only. /var Contains data directories used by various apps. Includes files for FTP (/var/ftp) or Web (/var/www) servers, system logs (/var/log), and spool files (/var/spool, like mail/cups). Files here change frequently. On servers, /var is often a separate partition. 4.1 Basic File System Commands cd, pwd, mkdir, rmdir, ls, touch\n4.2 Using Metacharacters and Operators Certain special characters are known as metacharacters or operators.\n4.2.1 File Matching Metacharacters (Wildcards) Metacharacter Description * Matches any number of characters ? Matches any single character [\u0026hellip;] Matches any character within the brackets; can include ranges of letters or numbers separated by a hyphen. Example: ls [a-g]* lists files or directories starting with letters a through g.\n4.2.2 File Redirection Metacharacters Metacharacter Description \u0026lt; Directs file content into a command. This is default behavior and often omitted. Example: less bigfile is same as less \u0026lt; bigfile. \u0026gt; Directs standard output (stdout) to a file. Overwrites the file if it exists. 2\u0026gt; Directs standard error (stderr) to a file. \u0026amp;\u0026gt; Directs both stdout and stderr to a file. \u0026raquo; Appends command output to the end of an existing file. Example command:\n1 man chmod | col -b \u0026gt; /tmp/chmod Formats the man page (man), strips backspaces (col -b), and saves output to /tmp/chmod (overwriting it if it exists).\n1 echo \u0026#34;Hello World!\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/hello Appends Hello World! to the file ~/hello.\nAnother type of redirection is called here text (or here document):\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ed /etc/resolv.conf \u0026lt;\u0026lt; resendit a nameserver 100.100.100.100 . w q resendit This uses the ed editor to automate adding a DNS server IP to /etc/resolv.conf (usually in a script run by root) using the content between the resendit tags.\n4.2.3 Brace Expansion Using {} allows you to expand a set of characters across filenames, directories, or arguments:\n1 touch memo{1,2,3,4,5} Creates 5 files: memo1 through memo5.\n1 touch {John,Bill,Sally}-{Breakfast,Lunch,Dinner} Creates 9 files.\n1 touch {a..f}{1..5} Creates 30 files from a1 to f5.\n4.3 Listing Files and Directories Usually, ls is aliased to ls --color=auto. Check aliases with:\n1 alias ls Use ls -la to see detailed info (-l) and hidden files (-a).\nColumn File Directory 1 Permissions Permissions 2 Number of links Number of links 3 Owner Owner 4 Group Group 5 Size in bytes Size of the directory file itself (not contents) 6 Last modification date/time Last modification date/time 7 Filename Directory name Notes:\nTime/date format depends on the LANG variable. An executable might have s permissions (-rwsr-sr-x), meaning any user can run it, but the process runs with the ownership of the app owner/group (SetUID/SetGID). If permissions end in t (drwxrwxr-t), it\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;sticky bit\u0026rdquo;. Users can add files, but cannot delete other users\u0026rsquo; files. SetGID on a directory makes new files inherit the directory\u0026rsquo;s group. If you see capital S or T instead of execution bits, it means SetGID or the sticky bit is set, but the execution bit is off. A plus sign at the end (-rw-rw-r-+) indicates extended attributes like ACLs or SELinux. A dot indicates SELinux attributes. cd ~yexca goes to yexca\u0026rsquo;s home. cd - returns to the previous working directory (stored in $OLDPWD). cd . refers to the current directory ($PWD).\nls flags: -t sorts by modification time; -F adds / to directories, * to executables, and @ to symlinks; --hide=yexca hides specific files/dirs; -S sorts by size; -d shows info about the directory itself instead of its contents.\n4.4 Understanding File Permissions and Ownership The first column of ls -l:\nThe first character is the file type:\nLetter Type - File d Directory l Symbolic link b Block device c Character device s Socket p Named pipe The next nine characters are permissions: first three for user (u), middle three for group (g), last three for others (o). (Acronym: ugo).\nPermissions mean slightly different things for files vs. directories:\nPermission File Directory Read View file content List contents of the directory Write Change content, rename, or delete Add or delete files/subdirectories within it Execute Run file as a program Enter the directory (cd), search it, or access file metadata Check any file/dir permissions with ls -ld.\nIn Fedora and RHEL, new users get their own group with the same name. This is the User Private Group (UPG) scheme.\n4.4.1 Using chmod (Numeric) to Change Permissions r = 4; w = 2; x = 1\n1 chmod -R 755 ~/myfile Recursively (-R) sets ~/myfile and its contents to 755 (rwxr-xr-x).\n4.4.2 Using chmod (Symbolic) to Change Permissions 1 chmod ug+rx files 1 chmod -R o-x ~/myfile 4.4.3 Using umask for Default Permissions Normal user defaults: files rw-rw-r--, directories rwxrwxr-x. Root user defaults: files rw-r--r--, directories rwxr-xr-x. These are set by umask. Type umask to see the value (e.g., 0002).\nThe umask value is subtracted from 666 (files) or 777 (dirs). A umask of 002 results in 775 for dirs and 644 for files (execution bits are off by default for files).\nTo change umask temporarily: umask [value]. Example: umask 000 creates wide-open files/dirs. To make it permanent, add the umask command to your .bashrc file. 4.4.4 Changing File Ownership Only root can change ownership.\n1 chown user:group /etc/file Changes /etc/file to be owned by user and group.

After enabling a lot of plugins, the desktop takes quite a while to appear after booting. I\u0026rsquo;ll need to disable some unused ones later.\nTheme I discovered the GNOME Look website through some reading . After browsing a bit, the very first theme I saw really caught my eye.\nLinks Theme: Fluent round gtk theme GitHub: vinceliuice/Fluent-gtk-theme: Fluent design gtk theme for linux desktops Installation According to the GitHub README, the transparent version requires the Blur Me extension. However, when I checked, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t compatible with my GNOME version (still isn\u0026rsquo;t as of writing this). I didn\u0026rsquo;t install the transparent version initially, but I eventually found a compatible one: Blur my Shell (the transparency looks amazing!).\nClone the repository via Git: 1 git clone https://github.com/vinceliuice/Fluent-gtk-theme.git Run the script: 1 ./install.sh You can add options for customization; check the README for previews.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 -d, --dest DIR Specify destination directory (Default: /usr/share/themes) -n, --name NAME Specify theme name (Default: Fluent) -t, --theme VARIANT Specify theme color variant(s) [default|purple|pink|red|orange|yellow|green|grey|all] (Default: blue) -c, --color VARIANT Specify color variant(s) [standard|light|dark] (Default: All variants) -s, --size VARIANT Specify size variant [standard|compact] (Default: All variants) -i, --icon VARIANT Specify icon variant(s) for shell panel [default|apple|simple|gnome|ubuntu|arch|manjaro|fedora|debian|void|opensuse|popos|mxlinux|zorin] (Default: Windows icon) --tweaks Specify versions for tweaks [solid|float|round|blur|noborder|square] solid: no transparency version float: floating panel round: rounded windows blur: blur version for \u0026#39;Blur-Me\u0026#39; noborder: windows and menu with no border square: square windows button -h, --help Show help Icons The theme has a matching icon set—gotta have it.\nLinks GitHub: vinceliuice/Fluent-icon-theme: Fluent icon theme for linux desktops Installation Similar to the theme, clone the repo first:\n1 git clone https://github.com/vinceliuice/Fluent-icon-theme.git Then run the script:\n1 ./install.sh Customization via options is also available; refer to the README.\nDock Extension used: Dash to Dock for COSMIC I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure how to get the exact dock from the theme preview, but this extension works well. You can achieve the transparency effect in the settings.\nMusic Player: Rhythmbox The default music player is decent, but the lack of a \u0026ldquo;repeat one\u0026rdquo; feature is incredibly annoying.\nGitHub: fossfreedom/alternative-toolbar: Modern, minimal and music-focused interface for Rhythmbox Installation Installation is straightforward. These are the steps for Fedora:\nFirst, download the archive from Releases , then configure the environment:\n1 sudo dnf install intltool git gnome-pkg-tools gobject-introspection glib2-devel pkg-config python3-gobject python3 Extract the files, enter the directory, and run:\n1 ./configure --prefix=/usr 1 make 1 sudo make install Uninstallation Run this command in the installation folder:\n1 sudo make uninstall Desktop Wallpaper I looked into using Wallpaper Engine videos as my desktop background.\nVideo Desktop This setup didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to handle dual monitors well (no auto-scaling) and flickered on every loop. I decided to drop it.\nEnvironment Setup mplayer First, enable the rpmfusion repo:\n1 sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-32.noarch.rpm Then install via dnf:\n1 sudo dnf install mplayer xwinwrap This only has an Ubuntu package, but you can run the binary directly after extracting it.\nSource: GitHub Deb download: xwinwrap_0.3.2git20171223_amd64.deb Extract the file, copy it to /usr/local/bin, and give it execution permissions.\nCommand For a single monitor:\n1 xwinwrap -ni -o 1 -fdt -fs -s -st -sp -b -nf -- mplayer -framedrop -nosound -loop 0 -wid WID -quiet ~/Pictures/bg.mp4 For dual monitors (this displays on the right monitor):\n1 xwinwrap -g 1920x1080+1920+0 -fdt -ni -b -nf -- mplayer -framedrop -nosound -loop 0 -wid WID -quiet ~/Pictures/bg.mp4 Check xwinwrap --help or the relevant section in the second reference article for more options.\nScheduled Wallpaper Rotation Possible, but requires specific formatting, naming, and manual file editing to add new images. Too much hassle, so I dropped this too.\nCreate Wallpaper Rotation Scope Create ~/.backgrounds/pic.xml with content like this (replace paths as needed):\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 \u0026lt;background\u0026gt; \u0026lt;starttime\u0026gt; \u0026lt;year\u0026gt;2022\u0026lt;/year\u0026gt; \u0026lt;month\u0026gt;9\u0026lt;/month\u0026gt; \u0026lt;day\u0026gt;17\u0026lt;/day\u0026gt; \u0026lt;hour\u0026gt;1\u0026lt;/hour\u0026gt; \u0026lt;minute\u0026gt;00\u0026lt;/minute\u0026gt; \u0026lt;second\u0026gt;00\u0026lt;/second\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/starttime\u0026gt; \u0026lt;static\u0026gt; \u0026lt;duration\u0026gt;4000.0\u0026lt;/duration\u0026gt; \u0026lt;file\u0026gt;~/.backgrounds/pic/00001.jpg\u0026lt;/file\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/static\u0026gt; \u0026lt;transition type=\u0026#34;overlay\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;duration\u0026gt;847.0\u0026lt;/duration\u0026gt; \u0026lt;from\u0026gt;~/.backgrounds/pic/00001.jpg\u0026lt;/from\u0026gt; \u0026lt;to\u0026gt;~/.backgrounds/pic/00050.jpg\u0026lt;/to\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/transition\u0026gt; \u0026lt;static\u0026gt; \u0026lt;duration\u0026gt;4000.0\u0026lt;/duration\u0026gt; \u0026lt;file\u0026gt;~/.backgrounds/pic/00050.jpg\u0026lt;/file\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/static\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/background\u0026gt; static defines display time (seconds) and location.\ntransition defines the transition time between images.\nCreate Config File Create ~/.backgrounds/pic-timed.xml:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 \u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE wallpapers SYSTEM \u0026#34;gnome-wp-list.dtd\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- /usr/share/gnome-background-properties --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;wallpapers\u0026gt; \u0026lt;wallpaper deleted=\u0026#34;false\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;name\u0026gt;Default Background\u0026lt;/name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;filename\u0026gt;~/.backgrounds/pic.xml\u0026lt;/filename\u0026gt; \u0026lt;options\u0026gt;zoom\u0026lt;/options\u0026gt; \u0026lt;shade_type\u0026gt;solid\u0026lt;/shade_type\u0026gt; \u0026lt;pcolor\u0026gt;#3465a4\u0026lt;/pcolor\u0026gt; \u0026lt;scolor\u0026gt;#000000\u0026lt;/scolor\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/wallpaper\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/wallpapers\u0026gt; Copy or link this file to /usr/share/gnome-background-properties/.

I wanted a NAS, but the budget didn\u0026rsquo;t allow it. So, I used four projects to set up a portal, anime, manga, and audio library on my own PC.\nPicking up where we left off last time , let\u0026rsquo;s keep tinkering.\nFinal Result Everything is deployed using Docker. Theoretically, it can be replicated on any platform that supports Docker.\nAdjusted the domain to link.start.icu. Originally there was no .icu, but the browser couldn\u0026rsquo;t resolve it without a TLD, so I added it (strangely, it looks better now). Mobile view image alignment is a bit\u0026hellip; off (it\u0026rsquo;s a mess). When I have time, I\u0026rsquo;ll deploy this to a server as a navigation page (though not being able to change titles directly is a pain, and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to mess with JS). Note: Deployed using Docker Desktop. Since the process is almost identical to last time , I won\u0026rsquo;t repeat the deployment steps.\nLogging into Docker Hub Apparently, you need to log in to use docker pull on some setups.\nFirst, register an account on the official site: Docker Hub Then initialize credentials by running:\n1 gpg --generate-key After entering your info, note the string on the line below pub in the output. Copy and replace [pub] in the following command:\n1 pass init [pub] Then log in via Docker Desktop.\nAnime - Jellyfin Docker Hub: jellyfin/jellyfin Official Site: Jellyfin: The Free Software Media System 1 docker pull jellyfin/jellyfin The cover art scraping isn\u0026rsquo;t perfect.

The UI looked great, but then I found out adding local libraries required installing their closed-source software. That software can access almost every file on the system (except the ones I actually mounted). Uninstalled. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll reconsider it if I ever build a proper NAS.\nDashboard - Heimdall Docker Hub: linuxserver/heimdall/ Official Site: Heimdall Application Dashboard 1 docker pull linuxserver/heimdall The second reference article mentions Unified Authentication, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t need it (mostly because it looked complicated).\nFinal Thoughts Based on this experience, you might not actually need to pay for a dedicated NAS OS. Buying PC parts to build a host, installing Linux, and using various open-source projects should provide a great experience.\nIf the command line is too much, you can always install a lightweight GUI like Xfce or JWM.\nReferences Talking about how to use Docker to build a \u0026ldquo;Synology\u0026rdquo;-like setup - SMZDM NAS can also use [Unified Authentication] - SMZDM Setting up your own media server with Plex \u0026amp; Docker - RIN\u0026rsquo;S HOME Building a better anime library with Jellyfin + Bangumi - Hatsune ","date":"2022-09-16T15:00:01+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/73/","title":"Personal Intranet Tinkering"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash-lite Intro Activated a plugin, now the backend is throwing a 502.\nAccessing the Database Navigate to the wp_options table.

Change IPv4 to Manual. Set the addresses as IP, 255.255.255.0, Router IP. For DNS, add the Router IP. I kept the automatic toggle checked.\nLocal DNS While IP access works, a domain name is much easier to remember.\nOn the router, go to Network - Hostnames. Enter your desired domain in the Hostname field and the computer\u0026rsquo;s IP in the IP Address field.\nInstalling Docker I went with Docker Desktop for the GUI.\nSet up the Repository 1 dnf -y install dnf-plugins-core 1 2 3 sudo dnf config-manager \\ --add-repo \\ https://download.docker.com/linux/fedora/docker-ce.repo Download the RPM Package Download it from the Official Website .\nOnce downloaded, double-click to install.\nInstalling Komga Docker Configuration File Sharing\nIn Docker Desktop, go to Settings - Resources - File sharing and add the path to your manga.\nNote: If the shared directory is missing (not mounted) on the next boot, Docker will fail to start.\nNetwork Settings\nNot sure if this is strictly necessary, but I set the subnet to match my own in Settings - Resources - Network.\nInstallation via CLI Run this directly in the shell:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 docker run \\ --name=komga \\ --user 1000:1000 \\ -p 2333:8080 \\ -v /home/yexca/komga/config:/config \\ -v /home/yexca/komga/data:/data \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ gotson/komga:latest -p: Maps the host port (left) to the container port (right). -v: Volume mapping. Maps a host directory (/home/yexca/komga/config) to the container (/config). Note: You cannot map hidden files (files starting with .) from the host.\nInstallation via GUI After the previous step, gotson/komga will appear in the Images tab of Docker Desktop.

There are other shells, such as the C shell (csh) popular among BSD UNIX users, the Korn shell (ksh) popular in UNIX System V, Dash (Ubuntu\u0026rsquo;s default shell, faster than Bash), Tcsh (an improved C shell), and Ash (very similar to the Bourne shell).\n3.1 Shell and Terminal Windows Using Terminal Windows Through the GUI, you can open a terminal emulator (sometimes called a Terminal window) to start a shell.\nMost systems open it via the Ctrl+Shift+T shortcut. In Fedora, look for it in the applications or press Alt+F2 and type gnome-terminal.\nUsing Virtual Consoles Most Linux systems with a GUI run multiple virtual consoles at startup. Besides the one running the GUI, you can open multiple shell sessions.\nSwitch virtual consoles using Ctrl+Shift+F1~F6. In Fedora, tty1 is gdm (login screen), tty2 is the first desktop, tty3 is the second (plain text), and so on.\nCommand Prompt For regular users, the default prompt is a simple dollar sign:\n$\nFor the root user, the default prompt is a pound sign (also known as a number sign or hash tag):\n#\nA vivid illustration of the US root being in the UK.\n3.2 Choosing a Shell Use the who command to display the current logged-in username, the virtual console, and the login time.\nUse grep username /etc/passwd. The end of the output shows the default shell being used.\nYou can switch shells by typing the command for it, such as ksh, tcsh, csh, sh, dash, or others (assuming they are installed).\nLearning Bash is important not just because it\u0026rsquo;s the default in most installs, but because it\u0026rsquo;s the standard for most Linux certification exams.\n3.3 Running Commands While many commands run just by typing their name, it\u0026rsquo;s common to follow them with options and arguments to change their behavior.\n3.3.1 Understanding Command Syntax Most commands have one or more options to modify behavior. Options are usually a single letter preceded by a hyphen -. You can combine multiple single-letter options or use a hyphen for each.\nSome options are full words, usually preceded by a double hyphen --. For example, to use the help option, you type --help. Typing -help would be interpreted as four options: -h, -e, -l, and -p. While some commands don\u0026rsquo;t follow the double-hyphen rule, most do for word-based options.\nMost commands also accept arguments after options or at the end of the line. An argument is a block of extra info, like a filename, directory, username, or device. You can usually use any number of arguments as long as you don\u0026rsquo;t exceed the total character limit of the command line.\nSometimes an argument is associated with an option and must follow it immediately. For single-letter options, the argument is usually after a space. For full-word options, the argument follows an equals sign =.\nExample:\n1 tar -cvf backup.tar /home/yexca The options mean create (c) a file (f) named backup.tar containing all files in /home/yexca, and show verbose details (v) once finished. Since backup.tar is an argument for the f option, it must follow it.\n1 ls --hide=Desktop The --hide option tells ls not to show the file or directory named Desktop. Note there is no space between the option and the argument.\nOther commands to try: The uname command shows the system type. Add the -a option to see the hostname and kernel version.\nWhen logged in, Linux assigns you an identity including a username, group name, user ID (UID), and group ID (GID). It also tracks the session time and location. Use the id command to see identity info.\nDistros with SELinux (Security Enhanced Linux) enabled show extra info at the end of id output, like:\ncontext=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023\nSELinux provides a way to strictly lock down Linux system security.\nUse who -uH to add idle time and process ID info (u) and print headers (H).\nIDLE shows how long the shell has been open without input. PID is the Process ID of the login shell. COMMENT shows the remote computer name (if logging in over a network) or the local X Display name (if using a Terminal window), such as :0.0.\n3.3.2 Finding Commands To find the command you typed, the shell searches through a \u0026ldquo;path\u0026rdquo;. For commands not in the path, you must provide the full path to the executable.\nUse echo $PATH to see the shell\u0026rsquo;s PATH environment variable.\nReference: Linux bin Directory - yexca’Blog Unlike some other OSs, Linux does not check the current directory for executables by default before searching the path. It only runs an executable in the current directory if it\u0026rsquo;s in the PATH or if you provide an absolute or relative path.\nNot all commands are in the PATH directories. Some are built into the shell. You can also override commands using aliases. Here is the order the shell uses to check input:\nAliases: Names set by the alias command. Type alias to see current ones.\nShell Reserved Words: Words reserved by the shell for special purposes.\nFunctions: Groups of commands that run together in the current shell.\nBuilt-in Commands: Commands built into the shell with no external file, like cd, echo, exit, pwd, history, fg (bring background command to foreground), set (set shell options), and type (show command location).\nFile System Commands: Commands stored in the computer\u0026rsquo;s file system (represented by the PATH variable).\nTo find where a command comes from, use type or which. Use type -a to show all known locations of a command.\nIf a command isn\u0026rsquo;t in the PATH, use locate to find it. locate can access any reachable part of the system.\nlocate searches the entire file system, not just command directories. If it can\u0026rsquo;t find a recently added file, run updatedb as root to update the database.\n3.4 Using Command History Repeating long, complex, or error-prone commands saves a lot of trouble.\n3.4.1 Command Line Editing By default, Bash uses Emacs-based command line editing. If you prefer vi, add set -o vi to your .bashrc file.\nNavigation Keys: Key Name Meaning Ctrl+F Forward one char Move forward one character Ctrl+B Backward one char Move backward one character Alt+F Forward one word Move forward one word Alt+B Backward one word Move backward one word Ctrl+A Start of line Go to the beginning of the line Ctrl+E End of line Go to the end of the line Ctrl+L Clear screen Clear screen, leave cursor at top Editing Keys: Key Name Meaning Ctrl+D Delete current Delete character at cursor Backspace Delete previous Delete character before cursor Ctrl+T Swap characters Swap current and previous characters Alt+T Swap words Swap current and previous words Alt+U Uppercase word Change current word to uppercase Alt+L Lowercase word Change current word to lowercase Alt+C Capitalize Capitalize the first letter of the word Ctrl+V Insert special Add a special character (e.g., a Tab) Cut and Paste Keys: Key Name Meaning Ctrl+K Cut to end Cut all characters after the cursor Ctrl+U Cut to start Cut all characters before the cursor Ctrl+W Cut prev word Cut the word before the cursor Alt+D Cut next word Cut the word after the cursor Ctrl+Y Paste current Paste the most recently cut text Alt+Y Paste earlier Cycle back to earlier cut text and paste Ctrl+C Delete line Delete the entire command line 3.4.2 Command Line Completion To reduce typing, Bash provides tab completion. Type a few characters and hit Tab. Bash can complete:\nCommands, aliases, or functions. Variables: If the text starts with $. Usernames: If the text starts with ~. ~username represents that user\u0026rsquo;s home directory. Hostnames: If the text starts with @, using entries from /etc/hosts. To add hostnames from other files, set the HOSTFILE variable to that filename (using the same format as /etc/hosts).\nIf there are multiple matches, double-tap Tab to list them all.\n3.4.3 Repeating History Commands Every line you type is saved to the shell\u0026rsquo;s history list.\nUse history to see the list, or add a number to see the most recent entries.\nUse the exclamation mark ! to rerun commands. These execute immediately without confirmation.\n!n \u0026mdash; Run command by number. e.g., !255. !! \u0026mdash; Run the previous command. !?string? \u0026mdash; Run the command containing the string. Besides running history directly, you can find and edit specific commands:\nKey Function Description Arrow keys orCtrl+P \u0026amp; Ctrl+N Step Traverse history list line by line Ctrl+R Reverse search Incremental search backward. Matches appear as you type Ctrl+S Forward search Incremental search forward (doesn\u0026rsquo;t work in all terminals) Alt+P Reverse search Search backward for a string. Hit Enter to see the match Alt+N Forward search Search forward for a string You can also use the fc command. Typing fc followed by a number or range (e.g., fc 233 255) opens those commands in a text editor (default is vi). When you close the editor, the commands run sequentially.\nWhen the shell closes, history is saved to .bash_history in your home directory (default limit is 1000 lines).\nTo exit without saving history, use kill -9 PID on the shell process.\nSetting HISTFILE to /dev/null or clearing HISTSIZE won\u0026rsquo;t stop the save if the shell exits normally.\n3.5 Connecting and Expanding Commands The real power of the shell lies in redirecting input/output between commands or files.\nShells use metacharacters to link or expand requests. These include |, \u0026amp;, ;, ), (, \u0026lt;, and \u0026gt;.\n3.5.1 Pipes Between Commands The pipe | connects the output of one command to the input of another. Example:\n1 cat /etc/passwd | sort | less This lists the contents of /etc/passwd, sorts them, and sends the result to less for viewing.\n3.5.2 Sequential Commands Use a semicolon ; to separate multiple commands on one line. Example:\n1 date ; troff -me VertLargeDocument | lpr ; date This formats a large document and shows the time before and after.\n3.5.3 Background Commands For long-running tasks, use the ampersand \u0026amp; to run them in the background. Example:\n1 troff -me VertLargeDocument | lpr \u0026amp; Don\u0026rsquo;t close the shell or kill the process before it finishes, or the task will terminate.\n3.5.4 Command Expansion Command substitution lets you use the output of one command as an argument for another.\nThe two forms are $(command) and command (backticks).\nExample:\n1 vi $(find /home | grep xyzzy) The shell runs the substitution first: find looks in /home, grep filters for \u0026ldquo;xyzzy\u0026rdquo;, and vi opens the resulting files one by one.\nNote: Don\u0026rsquo;t run this from the root directory or you might try to edit thousands of files.\n3.5.5 Arithmetic Expansion To pass arithmetic results to a command, use $[expression] or $((expression)). Example:\n1 echo \u0026#34;I am $[2022-1957] years old\u0026#34; Output: I am 65 years old.\n1 echo \u0026#34;There are $((ls | wc -w)) files in this directory\u0026#34; This counts the files (ls | wc -w) and outputs the number.\n3.5.6 Variable Expansion Use the dollar sign $ to expand variables. It prints the value of the variable, not the name. Example:\n1 ls -l $BASH Prints the long listing for the bash command: -rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 1390064 Jan 20 2022 /usr/bin/bash.\n3.6 Using Shell Variables The shell uses variables to store session info. Use set to see all variables.\nA subset of these are environment variables, which are passed to new shells opened from the current one. Use env to see these.\nSystem files also set variables for mail, paths, and config locations. Prefix the name with $ to reference the value.\nMany variables are preset at startup. Here are some common ones:\nVariable Description BASH Full path to the Bash command. Usually /bin/bash BASH_VERSION The version number of Bash EUID Effective User ID. Assigned from /etc/passwd at startup FCEDIT Editor used by the fc command. Default is vi HISTFILE Location of the history file, usually $HOME/.bash_history HISTFILESIZE Max history entries. Older ones are dropped when limit is reached HISTCMD Returns the current command number in the history list HOME Home directory HOSTTYPE System architecture (e.g., i386, x86_64) MAIL Mailbox location, usually /var/spool/mail/$USER OLDPWD The previous working directory OSTYPE OS identification (e.g., Linux or Linux-gnu) PATH Colon-separated list of directories searched for commands PPID Process ID of the parent process PROMPT_COMMAND A command to run before displaying the prompt PS1 Main shell prompt. PS2, PS3, etc., are for extra prompts PWD Current working directory RANDOM Generates a random number from 0-32767 SECONDS Seconds since the shell started SHLVL Shell nesting level. Increments when you start a sub-shell TMOUT Auto-logout time in seconds if the shell is idle 3.6.1 Creating and Using Aliases Use alias to list or create aliases.\n1 alias p=\u0026#39;pwd ; ls -CF\u0026#39; Running p now runs pwd then ls -CF. Use unalias to remove it.\n3.6.2 Exiting the Shell Type exit or press Ctrl+D.\n3.7 Customizing Your Shell Environment 3.7.1 Shell Configuration Multiple config files determine shell behavior:\nFile Description /etc/profile System-wide environment info for all users at login. Collects settings from /etc/profile.d /etc/bashrc Runs for every Bash shell. Sets default prompt and aliases ~/.bash_profile User-specific login settings. Usually sets environment variables and runs .bashrc ~/.bashrc Specific to Bash. Read at login and every new shell. Best place for aliases ~/.bash_logout Runs at logout. Usually clears the screen To change /etc/profile or /etc/bashrc, you need root access. It\u0026rsquo;s better to create /etc/profile.d/custom.sh for system-wide changes instead of editing the main files.\nnano Editor A simple text editor. Ctrl+O to save, Ctrl+X to exit.\n3.7.2 Setting the Prompt The prompt is set by the PS1 variable. Special characters include:\nCharacter Description \\! Current command history number \\# Command number in the current session \\$ $ for users, # for root \\W Basename of current directory \\[ Start of non-printing characters (for colors/bolding) \\] End of non-printing characters \\\\ Backslash \\d Date (Day Month Date) \\h Hostname \\n Newline \\nnn Character represented by octal number nnn \\s Shell name \\t Current time (HH:MM:SS) \\u Username \\w Full path of current directory Temporary change: export PS1=\u0026quot;[\\t\\w]\\$\u0026quot;\nPermanent change: Add the PS1 value to ~/.bashrc.\nRead more: Bash Prompt HOWTO 3.7.3 Adding Environment Variables You might want to add variables to .bashrc:\nTMOUT \u0026mdash; Seconds before auto-logout. PATH \u0026mdash; Search directories. To add /home/yexca/bin: PATH=$PATH:/home/yexca/bin ; export PATH This reads the current PATH, appends the new one, and exports it. Never add . (current directory) to your PATH for security reasons.\nCustom Variables: Create shortcuts for your workflow. MYWORKDIR=/home/yexca/work ; export MYWORKDIR Then just use cd $MYWORKDIR. 3.8 Getting Info on Commands Some commands are built into the shell. Use help | less or help command for info.\nMost commands support the --help or -h option.\nUse info and man command for in-depth documentation.\nManual (man) pages are the standard for Linux documentation. They are divided into 8 sections:\nSection Name Description 1 User Commands Commands run by normal users 2 System Calls Kernel programming functions 3 C Library Functions Interface functions for programming libraries 4 Devices and Special Files Files representing hardware/software devices 5 File Formats File types and config file formats 6 Games Games on the system 7 Miscellaneous Overviews of protocols, file systems, etc. 8 Admin Tools Commands requiring root/admin privileges Use man -k to search the database. If there are no results, run mandb as root to initialize it.\nUse man 5 passwd to view section 5 specifically.\nNavigate using Page Up/Down or Enter/Arrow keys. Search using / followed by the string. n for next match, N for previous. Press q to exit.\n","date":"2022-09-12T15:04:10+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/69/","title":"Linux Learning Chapter 3: Using the Shell"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Introduction Since we\u0026rsquo;ve already covered the Windows command line, we can\u0026rsquo;t skip Linux.\nWindows article: Downloading YouTube videos via Command Line Download yt-dlp I recommend setting up a Python environment first, then heading to Releases · yt-dlp/yt-dlp · GitHub to download yt-dlp.

Although the final result was, well, something, I learned quite a bit along the way.\nThe Start Searching openwrt connect shenlan authentication on the browser led me to a post on Ensine Wireless Forum . In the replies, I found an open-source project: coffeehat/BIT-srun-login-script . This project showed me there was a Go version supporting multiple platforms, including OpenWRT, so I started tinkering.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the project author\u0026rsquo;s article: Analysis and Python Implementation of Shenlan Campus Network Login - BIT Version Before Tinkering OpenWRT versions didn\u0026rsquo;t provide compiled binaries (IPK files). My limited skills meant I couldn\u0026rsquo;t understand the README. I asked a classmate, who told me it was a Linux command. However, after trying it, I realized it was for compiling the Linux kernel. I gave up on trying on my physical machine and started using a virtual machine.\nReference: Building a custom kernel/zh-cn - Fedora Project Wiki Let\u0026rsquo;s Tinker A friend sent me configuration - How to fix make error \u0026ldquo;No rule to make target \u0026lsquo;menuconfig\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; when building a kernel for Beagleboard? - Unix \u0026amp; Linux Stack Exchange , so I followed its advice.\nSetting Up a Virtual Machine I\u0026rsquo;m using Fedora\u0026rsquo;s built-in virtualization software, \u0026ldquo;Boxes.\u0026rdquo; First, I tried installing CentOS 8. My ISO was on an external drive, so I mounted it and selected it. It failed to create the VM. I tried CentOS 7, failed. Then Ubuntu, failed.\nAfter multiple failures, I almost doubted the software, even though I\u0026rsquo;d successfully created a Windows 10 VM with it before. I opened the error log, but it was gibberish. However, I noticed a Chinese character in a path. I changed the path to English and tried again. Failed.\nThe next day, I thought, since it\u0026rsquo;s about kernel compilation, maybe Kali Linux would work. I copied the Kali ISO from my USB to my computer. Although the installation ultimately failed, it ran successfully. Did the system need to be local?\nSo, I copied the CentOS 7 ISO to ~/Documents/ and the installation succeeded. Since I only needed to compile an IPK, I used the root user.\nConnecting to the Network I assumed creating a Linux VM in Linux would automatically share the network. So, I directly ran wget https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.19.6.tar.xz. The result was \u0026ldquo;cannot resolve host.\u0026rdquo; Using ifconfig, I saw no IP address.\nI followed the guide Setting Static IP in a Virtual Machine (CentOS Example) to get the VM online. For file modification, I just needed to change ONBOOT to yes and add two DNS entries.\nInstalling Git After getting online, I installed Git using yum install git. Then, I configured my name and email.\n1 git config --global user.name \u0026#34;Name\u0026#34; 1 git config --global user.email \u0026#34;email@example.com\u0026#34; Transferring Files I continued trying to download the Linux kernel using wget. I tried three or four times, with downloads failing around 50% and at very slow speeds.\nNote: Using wget -c URL allows for resuming interrupted downloads.\nThen, the \u0026ldquo;Boxes\u0026rdquo; software seemed to support direct drag-and-drop. I downloaded the file on my main computer and dragged it over. It failed. The file wasn\u0026rsquo;t transferred. Considering the target location was ~/Downloads/ and I was using the root account, I followed Adding Users and Administrator Users in Linux to create a new user. (I almost ran the step to delete the user.)\nI switched to the new user with su username, created the ~/Downloads/ directory, and dragged the file again. Still failed.\nI tried using Boxes\u0026rsquo; sharing feature to share my computer\u0026rsquo;s ~/Public folder. No matter how I tried, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t see it in the VM. (I suspect this software only works well with RHEL and Fedora.)\nSSH Transfer Then I remembered SSH transfer (because ftp wasn\u0026rsquo;t installed, and I was too lazy to install it).\nI enabled SSH on my local machine and then used the scp command to transfer files via SSH.\n1 scp username@servername:/path/filename ~/Downloads/ First, I needed the IP address. In the VM, I ran ip route and got the IP: 10.0.2.2.\nThen, I used the scp command to transfer.\nExtracting Files I used the tar command to extract the files.\n1 tar -xzvf filename.tar.xz Uh oh, this isn\u0026rsquo;t a gzip compressed file. How do I extract it?\nSSH Transfer I\u0026rsquo;ll use SSH transfer again. Just add -r to the scp command to transfer directories.\nFirst Attempt Following the steps, I placed the extracted files in /usr/src/. I copied the config file from /boot to /usr/src/linux-5.19.6/.config. However, whether I put the config file in .config/ or .config, the make menuconfig command still wouldn\u0026rsquo;t run.\nConclusion Tinkering failed. I\u0026rsquo;ll try again later.\nHowever, while writing this article, I noticed the original post suggested running Python directly on OpenWRT. I\u0026rsquo;ll try that if I have time.\nAnother Attempt I consulted a friend who had successfully connected to the school network (though he used a regular router). He changed his router\u0026rsquo;s MAC address to his computer\u0026rsquo;s. Then, when he plugged in the network cable, the authentication page automatically forwarded to his computer. After authenticating, he had internet access, but it was through Ruijie\u0026rsquo;s web authentication.\nConsidering Shenlan uses Portal authentication (web page authentication), and it\u0026rsquo;s web-based, can I authenticate by modifying HTTP packets? Are there Linux commands to send HTTP packets? I searched and found curl and wget can simulate get and post requests. (So I opened Fiddler to capture packets, trying to replicate the authentication process.)\nJust kidding. I connected my router to the school network, then connected my computer to the router via Ethernet cable. I entered the IP address of the authentication page, completed authentication, and the router had internet access.\nSimulating HTTP GET or POST Requests with Linux Commands Although I didn\u0026rsquo;t end up using them, I\u0026rsquo;ll document them since I found them.\nGET Request curl 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ## If the URL points to a file, it can be downloaded directly curl URL ## Display all information curl -i URL ## Display only header information curl -l URL ## Show the full parsing process of the GET request curl -v URL wget 1 wget URL POST Request curl 1 2 3 4 5 6 ## Use the -d parameter to include parameters in the request curl -d \u0026#34;param1=value1\u0026amp;param2=value2\u0026#34; \u0026#34;URL\u0026#34; curl -d \u0026#39;param1=value1\u0026amp;param2=value2\u0026#39; -X POST URL curl -d \u0026#39;param1=value1\u0026#39; -d \u0026#39;param2=value2\u0026#39; -X POST URL wget 1 2 ## Use the --post-data parameter wget --post-data \u0026#39;user=name\u0026amp;passwd=passwd\u0026#39; URL Another Conclusion Sometimes, you can overcomplicate things. A simple solution might be overlooked if you only think about it and dismiss it without trying. This whole detour happened because I initially dismissed the \u0026ldquo;Another Attempt\u0026rdquo; part. (If my data plan wasn\u0026rsquo;t so limited, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have bothered trying.)\nAs I write this, two famous quotes come to mind:\nLearning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous.\nExperience is the mother of all knowledge.\nSo, sometimes you should just go for it and try, don\u0026rsquo;t let overthinking limit you!\nReferences Asking for Help: How to Flash Firmware for Shenlan Campus Network Portal Authentication? - Xiaomi Wireless Routers and Xiaomi Wireless Related Devices - Ensine Wireless Forum configuration - How to fix make error \u0026ldquo;No rule to make target \u0026lsquo;menuconfig\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; when building a kernel for Beagleboard? - Unix \u0026amp; Linux Stack Exchange Setting Static IP in a Virtual Machine (CentOS Example) - yexca\u0026rsquo;Blog Installing Git - Leo Xuefeng\u0026rsquo;s Official Website Adding Users and Administrator Users in Linux - yexca\u0026rsquo;Blog How to Switch Between Users in Linux System_M Li Li\u0026rsquo;s Blog - CSDN Blog_linux switch system Using SSH to Transfer Files - SegmentFault Linux tar Command - CoderBae Portal Authentication Principles - Cao Shihong\u0026rsquo;s Blog Linux Command to Send Http GET or POST Requests (curl and wget methods)_cyl937\u0026rsquo;s Blog - CSDN Blog ","date":"2022-09-05T21:24:23+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/66/","title":"Tinkering with OpenWRT for Shenlan Network Authentication"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash Intro I stumbled upon YouTube-dl and found it super handy for downloading entire channels. The only catch was the webm format it outputted isn\u0026rsquo;t always compatible. So, I looked into ffmpeg commands for format conversion.\nConfig File Later, I realized a simple config file tweak would do the trick. Just add this line to your config:\n1 --merge-output-format mp4 Here\u0026rsquo;s my full config file:\n1 -o \u0026#39;C:/Users/yexca/Downloads/Video/%(uploader)s/%(upload_date)s%(title)s%(id)s.%(ext)s\u0026#39; --merge-output-format mp4 Single Command You can quickly transcode with this command:\n1 ffmpeg -i before.webm after.mp4 But doing it one by one is way too slow, which led me to think about batch processing.\nBatch Processing Create a new Notepad file and paste this code:\n1 for %%a in (*.webm) do ffmpeg -i \u0026#34;%%~a\u0026#34; -vcodec copy -f mp4 \u0026#34;%%~na.mp4\u0026#34; Here, (*.webm) is the original file type, and \\\u0026quot;%%~na.mp4\\\u0026quot; is the desired output file type.\nSave it as run.bat, drop it into the target folder, and run it.\nHowever, having to edit it every time for different files isn\u0026rsquo;t super practical.\nDOS Script So, I dove a bit into .bat files and quickly whipped up the following script (FYI: GB2312 encoding is needed for proper Chinese output in the command line).\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 echo off :0 echo Please enter a number to select an operation echo 1.

(Note: Reading the book and writing this took 5 days).\nHTTP Message Structure There are two types of HTTP messages: Request and Response.\nHTTP Request An HTTP request consists of three parts: the Request Line, the Request Headers, and the Body.\nThe first line (Request Line) contains the Method, URI, and protocol version. Example: GET https://blog.yexca.net/ HTTP/2 The second part is the Headers. The third part is the Body. Note: There is an empty line between the Headers and the Body.\nHTTP Response The structure of an HTTP response is basically the same as a request, also divided into three parts: the Response Line (Status Line), the Response Headers, and the Body.\nThe first line contains the protocol version, status code, and status message. Example: HTTP/2 200 The second part is the Headers. The third part is the Body. Note: There is an empty line between the Headers and the Body.\nHTTP Methods and Status Codes URL Format URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It\u0026rsquo;s used to describe the address of a resource on the Internet.\nThe basic format of a URL is:\nschema://host[:port#]/path/.../[?query-string][#anchor]\nAttribute Description schema Specifies the underlying protocol (e.g., http, https, ftp) host The IP address or domain name of the HTTP server port# The default port for HTTP is 80; it can be omitted if using the default. Otherwise, it must be specified path The path to the resource query-string Data sent to the HTTP server anchor An internal page hyperlink HTTP Request Methods No. Method Description 1 GET Requests a specific resource and returns the entity body 2 HEAD Similar to GET, but the response has no body; used to retrieve headers 3 POST Submits data to be processed (e.g., form submission or file upload). Data is included in the body. May create new resources or modify existing ones 4 PUT Replaces the content of the target resource with the uploaded data 5 DELETE Requests the server to delete the specified resource GET vs. POST GET data is appended to the URL, separated by a ? (query-string, key-value pairs), and parameters are connected with \u0026amp;. POST puts data in the HTTP message Body. GET has size limits (due to browser URL length limits). POST has no size limits for data. In code, GET typically uses Request.QueryString to get variables, while POST uses Request.Form. HTTP Status Codes Status codes are in the HTTP response. The server uses them to tell the client what happened. They are divided into five categories.\nStatus Code Defined Range Category 1XX 100–101 Informational: Request received, continue processing 2XX 200–206 Success: Request successfully received, understood, and accepted 3XX 300–305 Redirection: Further action needed to complete the request 4XX 400–415 Client Error: Request has bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled 5XX 500–505 Server Error: Server failed to fulfill a valid request Common Status Codes Name Meaning 200 OK: Server successfully processed the request 301/302 Moved Permanently / Found (Redirect): The URL has moved. The response should contain a Location URL 304 Not Modified: Client\u0026rsquo;s cached version is up to date; use the cache 404 Not Found: Resource not found 401 Unauthorized: Authentication required 501 Not Implemented (Source mentions Internal Server Error): Server encountered an error 206 (Partial Content) The 206 status code means the server successfully processed a partial GET request. This is used for resumable downloads or online video streaming.\nExample of a video request:\nBrowser sends GET with Header: Range: bytes=5303296-5336063. Server returns 206 with Header: Content-Range: bytes 5303296-5336063/12129376. 301 vs. 302 (Redirects) After receiving 301 or 302, the browser makes a new request to the URL in the Location header.\n301: Old address is permanently moved. Search engines transfer authority to the new URL. (e.g., switching domains). 302: Old address still exists; the redirect is temporary. (e.g., redirecting to a login page). 304 (Not Modified) Indicates the cached version is still valid and can be used.\n400 (Bad Request) Syntax error in the client request. The server cannot understand it (e.g., malformed form data or corrupted Cookies).\n401 (Unauthorized) Authentication error. Used when HTTP Basic Authentication is required but the Authorization header is missing or invalid.\n404 (Not Found) Server cannot find the resource. Can also be used to hide a resource (refuse request without reason). For example, BV1AB4y1D7Ft is only visible if logged in and favorited; otherwise, it returns 404.\n403 (Forbidden) The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it. Unlike 401, re-authenticating makes no difference.\n500 (Internal Server Error) Generic server error. Could be code bugs, DB connection issues, uncaught exceptions, or null pointers.\n503 (Server Unavailable) Server is temporarily unable to handle the request (overloaded or down for maintenance).\nFull list of status codes Visit: HTTP Status Codes - Runoob HTTP Headers Headers use the \u0026ldquo;key: value\u0026rdquo; format, one per line.\nCache-related Headers Both requests and responses use headers for caching. Caching allows retrieving files from local storage instead of the original server.\nCookie A type of HTTP cache/storage. Key-value format (e.g., ip_country=CN). Browsers send them via the \u0026ldquo;Cookie\u0026rdquo; header; servers set them via \u0026ldquo;Set-Cookie\u0026rdquo;.\nAccept Media types the client can handle. Accept: text/html means the browser wants HTML. * is a wildcard.\nAccept-Encoding Related to compression. The browser tells the server which compression algorithms it supports (e.g., Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate).\nAccept-Language The languages the client understands (e.g., Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8,zh-CN;q=0.6). Note: language $\\neq$ character set.\nUser-Agent Identifies the client\u0026rsquo;s OS, browser version, engine, etc. Example: User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:103.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/103.0.\nReferer Indicates the source page the user came from. Used for analytics and hotlink protection.\nConnection In HTTP/1.1, Connection: Keep-Alive is default. It keeps the TCP connection open for multiple requests.\nHost Specifies the target host and port. Port 80 is usually hidden.\nHTTP Caching Caching exists at the browser, server, and proxy levels. It reduces redundant data, saves time, and lowers server load.\nJudging Cache Freshness The server checks cache validity in two ways:\nLast-Modified / If-Modified-Since: Browser sends the last modification time. If the file hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed, the server returns 304. ETag / If-None-Match: Browser sends a unique hash (ETag) of the file content. Cache Headers Request Headers Name Description Cache-Control: max-age=0 Force revalidation If-Modified-Since Last modification time of the cached file If-None-Match ETag value of the cached file Cache-Control: no-cache Do not use cache Pragma: no-cache Do not use cache (Legacy) Response Headers Name Description Cache-Control: public Can be cached by public proxies/users Cache-Control: private Cache only for specific user Cache-Control: no-cache Must validate with server before using cache Cache-Control: no-store Never cache (for sensitive data) Cache-Control: max-age=60 Cache expires in 60s (relative) Date Time response was sent Expires Absolute expiration time Last-Modified Last modification time on server Etag Unique hash of the server file Note: Cache-Control takes precedence over Expires.\nETag Entity Tag. A hash string representing the file state. It solves issues where Last-Modified isn\u0026rsquo;t precise enough (it only goes down to the second) or where modification times change but content doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nForcing No Cache Ctrl+Shift+R forces a refresh, adding Cache-Control: no-cache to the request.\nDirect Cache Use Typing the URL in the address bar usually results in a \u0026ldquo;cache hit\u0026rdquo; if valid, without even checking the server.\nCompression and URL Encoding HTTP compression reduces the size of text content (HTML, JS, CSS) during transfer.\nCompression Process Browser sends Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate. Server generates response, compresses the Body with gzip, updates Content-Length, and adds Content-Encoding: gzip. Browser receives response and decompresses it. Note: Browsers usually don\u0026rsquo;t compress requests.\nEncoding Types Encoding Description gzip GNU zip compress UNIX compress deflate zlib format identity No encoding (Default) gzip is the most efficient and widely used.\nDeep Dive into Cookies HTTP is stateless. Each request is independent. Sessions solve this by maintaining state between the browser and server.\nSessions vs. Cookies Server creates a session and sends the Session ID to the browser. Browser stores the ID and sends it back in subsequent requests. Server identifies the user via the ID. Cookies are the mechanism browsers use to store this ID.\nWhat are Cookies? Small data stored as key=value pairs, separated by semicolons. Primarily used for authentication, user preferences, and ad tracking. Some regions (EU) have laws requiring user consent for cookies.\nCookie Attributes Expires: When it expires. If omitted, it\u0026rsquo;s a session cookie (deleted when browser closes). Path: The scope of the cookie. / means the whole site. HttpOnly: Prevents JavaScript from reading the cookie. Essential for security against XSS. Categories Session Cookie: Temporary, stored in memory. Persistent Cookie: Stored on disk with an expiration date. Used for \u0026ldquo;auto-login.\u0026rdquo; HTTP Basic Authentication Used by some desktop apps and routers. The client sends username:password encoded in Base64 via the Authorization header.\nProcess:\nServer returns 401 and a WWW-Authenticate header. Browser prompts for credentials. Browser sends Base64 encoded credentials. Disadvantages Stateless: Every request must be authenticated. Insecure: Base64 is easily reversed. Must use HTTPS. No Logout: Cannot log out without closing the browser or clearing history. Vulnerable to replay attacks. Digest Authentication An improved version of Basic Auth. It uses hashes (MD5) and a \u0026ldquo;nonce\u0026rdquo; (number used once) from the server to prevent password sniffing and replay attacks.\nReferences “Graphing HTTP” Summary - yexca\u0026rsquo;Blog HTTP Status Codes - Runoob Cookie locations in IE/Firefox/Chrome Replay Attack - Wikipedia What is a REST API?

These directories are just conventions, but following them is a good idea—nobody wants a messy system, especially on Linux.\nPriority These bin directories in Linux all store commands. If there are executables with the same name in different directories, the execution order is determined by priority. You can check your $PATH environment variable to see this priority:\n1 2 [yexca@yexca-PC ~]$ echo $PATH /home/yexca/.local/bin:/home/yexca/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin Paths are separated by :. The earlier a path appears in the list, the higher its priority.\n/bin Essential system commands. bin is short for binary. This directory contains fundamental executables required for the system to run, such as: cat, cp, chmod, df, dmesg, gzip, kill, ls, mkdir, more, mount, rm, su, tar, etc.\n/usr/bin Executables pre-installed by the system that may change during system updates.\nIt also contains execution scripts for software installed later. It mainly houses essential executables for applications and tools like: c++, g++, gcc, chdrv, diff, dig, du, eject, elm, free, gnome*, gzip, htpasswd, kfm, ktop, last, less, locale, m4, make, man, mcopy, ncftp, newaliases, nslookup, passwd, quota, smb*, wget, etc.\n/usr/local/bin The place for users to put their own executables. It\u0026rsquo;s recommended to use this directory because system updates won\u0026rsquo;t overwrite files here that share names with system defaults.\n/sbin Short for \u0026ldquo;Superuser bin.\u0026rdquo; It contains essential programs for system administration, such as: cfdisk, dhcpcd, dump, e2fsck, fdisk, halt, ifconfig, ifup, ifdown, init, insmod, lilo, lsmod, mke2fs, modprobe, quotacheck, reboot, rmmod, runlevel, shutdown, etc.\n/usr/sbin Contains system administration programs installed by the user or the distribution, such as: dhcpd, httpd, imap, in.*d, inetd, lpd, named, netconfig, nmbd, samba, sendmail, squid, swap, tcpd, tcpdump, etc.\nReferences Linux /usr/bin与/usr/local/bin区别_学亮编程手记的博客-CSDN博客 /bin,/sbin,/usr/sbin,/usr/bin 目录之简单区别_IT农夫的博客-CSDN博客 ","date":"2022-08-31T00:27:09+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/60/","title":"The bin Directories in Linux"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash Intro Here\u0026rsquo;s a list of things I install after setting up Fedora.\nChange Terminal Shortcut Open Settings \u0026gt; Keyboard, then find View and Customize Shortcuts at the bottom.\nCustom Shortcuts\nName: Shell Terminal\nCommand: gnome-terminal\nShortcut: Custom\nUpdate System 1 sudo dnf update Change Screenshot Shortcut Still prefer Windows-style shortcuts.\nUnder Screenshot, change Interactive Screenshot to Win+Shift+S.\nChange User Directories to English Chinese directories are a pain to use with the terminal.\nFirst, switch the language to English.\n1 export LANG=en_US Then update user directories.\n1 xdg-user-dirs-gtk-update At this point, it\u0026rsquo;ll ask if you want to change user folders to English.

Since I\u0026rsquo;m into static sites, using Git to sync web files is really practical.\nInstall Git Log in as ROOT, then punch in these commands:\n1 2 yum install curl-devel expat-devel gettext-devel openssl-devel zlib-devel perl-devel yum install git Create User Let\u0026rsquo;s create a Git group and a user to run the Git service.\n1 2 groupadd git useradd git -g git Get Your Public Key This part is about getting your public key from your own machine. We\u0026rsquo;ll use Windows as an example.\nYour id_rsa.pub file is stored in %UserProfile%/.ssh/.\nIf it\u0026rsquo;s not there, just open cmd and run ssh-keygen; it\u0026rsquo;ll generate one for you.\nImport Public Key Import the public key (or keys) into /home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys, one per line. If the file doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, create it:\n1 2 3 4 5 cd /home/git/ mkdir .ssh chmod 755 .ssh touch .ssh/authorized_keys chmod 644 .ssh/authorized_keys Then use vi or vim to import the public key. For vim usage, check out: Vim Text Editing Initialize Git Repository Pick a directory for your Git repo. Let\u0026rsquo;s say /home/gitrepo/repo.git.\n1 2 3 4 5 cd /home mkdir gitrepo chown git:git gitrepo cd gitrepo git init --bare repo.git The commands above create a bare Git repository. Server-side Git repos usually end with .git. Next, change the repo\u0026rsquo;s owner to the git user:\n1 chown -R git:git runoob.git Clone Repository 1 2 3 git clone git@YourIP:RepoDirectory // For example git clone git@127.0.0.1:/home/gitrepo/repo.git Sync Directory The auto-sync feature uses Git hooks.\nNavigate to your repo directory: /home/gitrepo/repo.git\n1 2 cd /home/gitrepo/repo.git cd hooks Create and edit the post-receive file:\n1 vi post-receive Add the following content to the file:\n1 2 #!/bin/sh git --work-tree=SyncTargetDirectory --git-dir=RepoLocation checkout -f For example:\n1 2 #!/bin/sh git --work-tree=/home/www/hexo --git-dir=/home/gitrepo/repo.git checkout -f Then set read/write permissions for the file:\n1 chmod +x post-receive Change the owner of the repo.git directory to the git user.\n1 chown -R git:git /home/gitrepo/repo.git Update Code If you\u0026rsquo;re sure nothing\u0026rsquo;s changed and you just need to update local code, simply use:\n1 git pull The proper workflow:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 // Check local branch file status to avoid conflicts during update. git status // If files are modified, you can revert them to the original state; if files need to be updated to the server, you should merge to the server first, then update locally. git checkout – [file name] // Check current branch status. git branch // If it\u0026#39;s a local branch, you need to switch to the remote branch on the server. git checkout remote branch git pull Other Commands 1 2 3 4 git branch // Check branches git checkout aaa // Switch to branch \u0026#39;aaa\u0026#39; git branch aaa // Create branch \u0026#39;aaa\u0026#39; git checkout -b aaa // Create branch \u0026#39;aaa\u0026#39; locally and switch to it. The branch will only be created on the server when you push. Disable Shell Login for Git User For security, we need to prevent the git user from logging in via shell. You can do this by editing /etc/passwd:\n1 vi /etc/passwd Change this:\n1 git:x:1004:1004::/home/git:/bin/bash To this:\n1 git:x:1004:1004::/home/git:/usr/bin/git-shell This way, the git user can still use Git normally via SSH, but can\u0026rsquo;t log into the shell.\nReferences Linux chown Command - Runoob Tutorial Git Server Setup - Runoob Tutorial Git - Generating Your SSH Public Key Introduction to SSH Keys and Their Use in Git - Jianshu Git - Getting Git on a Server Git: Updating Local Code - ftToday\u0026rsquo;s Blog - CSDN How to Set Up a Hexo Blog on a Server - Alibaba Cloud Developer Community Linux Permissions Explained (chmod, 600, 644, 700, 711, 755, 777, 4755, 6755, 7755) - Lin20\u0026rsquo;s Blog - CSDN Detailed Analysis of Linux /etc/passwd file - Jtianlin - Blog Garden ","date":"2022-08-13T10:28:50+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/57/","title":"Set Up Git Server and Sync to a Specific Directory"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview This article was written by Hiyoung Original article: https://blog.hiyoung.icu/2022/08/11/607cac6fe835/ Most mainstream streaming platforms support embedding code for external links.

By the time I actually understood it, RSS was already on the decline. Projects like RSSHub were keeping the flame alive, but I eventually gave up on it due to frequent connection issues. However, as I\u0026rsquo;ve discovered more blogs, I\u0026rsquo;ve returned to RSS to stay updated and keep track of what I\u0026rsquo;ve read.\nWhat is RSS? RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication. It\u0026rsquo;s a format specification for web feeds. Websites use it to provide titles, summaries, or full articles to subscribers. Users can aggregate these links into a single tool to read everything in one place.\nIn other words, while mainstream media pushes content to us (passive consumption), RSS is about actively seeking knowledge. You find your own sources, and the feed only shows what you actually subscribed to.\nWhy use RSS? Pick up your phone, open any news app, and the homepage is nothing but \u0026ldquo;recommendations.\u0026rdquo; Between infinite scrolling and big-data algorithms, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to waste a whole day on low-quality, one-sided content. I hate that feeling of time slipping away. I believe relaxation should be intentional, not passive. Using RSS is my way of resisting the \u0026ldquo;information cocoon.\u0026rdquo;\nOn a small scale, it\u0026rsquo;s about marking unread articles and following blogs I care about. On a larger scale, as recommendation algorithms get more precise, they limit our horizons. RSS helps maintain the ability to actively seek information and learn.\nHow to use it First, you need an RSS reader. I use QuiteRSS , which is open source.\nNext, you need subscription feeds. You\u0026rsquo;ll have to find these yourself. If a site doesn\u0026rsquo;t explicitly provide one, check RSSHub (ensure your network connection is stable).\nHow to find RSS feeds: How to find the RSS feed URL for Feedzy RSS Feeds For example, this site\u0026rsquo;s feed is: https://blog.yexca.net/feed.xml To check if a link is a valid feed: Feed Validator for Atom and RSS Just copy the feed URL, open your software, and create a new source.\nAfterword I had high hopes for this post, but when I actually sat down to write, I found it hard to express exactly what I was feeling. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ve been \u0026ldquo;poisoned\u0026rdquo; by too much low-quality web content for too long—I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten how to write properly.\nI had a lot of thoughts before starting, but they didn\u0026rsquo;t quite make it to the page. It is what it is.\nReferences / Recommended Reading What is the RSS for HACG?

It\u0026rsquo;s a retelling, so some details might not be exact.\nMission Brief Passed a test from some shadowy figure, got HackShop access, and then the first mission dropped.\nThe mission brief: \u0026ldquo;The client wants the login credentials of the user Daronane. The remote ip of the victim is 54.44.37.52. It\u0026rsquo;s important that you access the correct machine behind the public ip. The victim\u0026rsquo;s ip LAN is 172.16.6.7\u0026rdquo;\nMission Analysis Target: Daronane\u0026rsquo;s login. Victim\u0026rsquo;s public IP: 54.44.37.52. LAN IP: 172.16.6.7.\nInitial Probe Following Grey Hack Single Player Game Guide (1) - MapleGe \u0026rsquo;s method, I tried\u0026hellip;\nFirst, whois command for the admin email: Eggett@sabmi.net. Sent a \u0026ldquo;Login issue\u0026rdquo; email. Got Daronane\u0026rsquo;s password: pierra.\nTried ssh Daronane@pierra 54.44.37.52 to connect to 54.44.37.52. Failed. Error: incorrect user/password.\nFigured I mistyped (manual input, right?). Tried a few more times, even copy-pasting. Still incorrect user/password. Gave up on that.\nBrowsed the IP. No clues, just \u0026ldquo;Metlifegroup. Everything you need for your tech company\u0026rdquo; and a pic (Raspberry Pi?). Guessed it was a forum, and Daronane a user there?\nGame Localization Remembered missing some Exploits tutorial info when hitting HackShop. Searched for game localization. Found [简体中文](simplified Chinese) on the Workshop, subscribed, restarted. UI still English.\nFound Workshop download: steam_folder\\steamapps\\workshop\\content\\605230\\2825584160. README.md said to drop its contents into C:\\Users\\%UserName%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Loading Home\\Grey Hack\\ .\nActually, just custom_lang.json in that folder was enough.\nRestarted the game, hit language on the left, picked Chinese. Localized.\nReading the Manual Read the Exploits section in the localized manual (tbh, it felt almost the same as unlocalized). Still couldn\u0026rsquo;t wrap my head around it.\nFurther Exploration Kept digging for guides, found nada. Then hit Grey Hack: A Relatively Simple Mission - Bilibili .\nThe term \u0026ldquo;script kiddie\u0026rdquo; in the article clicked: Exploits are basically real-world attack scripts.\nMisguided Exploration Grabbed scanlib and scanrouter from HackShop.\nRan scanlib 54.44.37.52. Output: Missing metaxploit. No idea what that meant.\nnmap 54.44.37.52 showed two open ports: 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP).\nscanrouter revealed Kernel_router.so:V1.0.0 on the server. Searched for scripts, found one: \u0026ldquo;Get access to a shell\u0026rdquo;, no requirements.\nDownloaded it to /home/yexca/hacktool. Navigated there, ran KernelRouterAccess 54.44.37.52. Error: Can't find metaxploit library in the /lib path or the current folder.\nNote: Initially, I didn\u0026rsquo;t rename this script. Later, I renamed it to KernelRouterAccess for clarity in this post. Other scripts mentioned here were also renamed after initial download, differing from their store names.\nError pointed to a missing file. /lib? Was the target server missing the file, thus couldn\u0026rsquo;t recognize it and grant access?\nRethinking nmap showed ports 22/80. My guess: victim\u0026rsquo;s a forum user. So, HackShop for an HTTP script. Found one: \u0026ldquo;Grant access to the file /etc/passwd and decipher its contents.\u0026rdquo; Requirement: \u0026ldquo;Minimum number of 1 users registered in the computer\u0026rdquo;. Forum implied multiple users, unlikely they\u0026rsquo;d dev as root.\nDownloaded the script, ran HttpPasswd 54.44.37.52 80. Same error: Can't find metaxploit library in the /lib path or the current folder.\nNo surprise there. scanrouter only found Kernel_router.so:V1.0.0, no libhttp.so or anything similar.\nPicked the HTTP script because that article said: \u0026ldquo;Just get the mission done; no remote connection needed, and local script execution leaves no traces.\u0026rdquo;\nOkay, let\u0026rsquo;s retry SSH. HackShop for SSH scripts. Found one: \u0026ldquo;Take advantage of a vulnerability in the ssh service to inject a new password to a registered user.\u0026rdquo; Requirement: \u0026ldquo;Any user logged in the computer.\u0026rdquo; Devs would have logged in, so this should work.\nDownloaded, ran SSHPasswd 54.44.37.52 22. Still hit with Can't find metaxploit library in the /lib path or the current folder.\nWTF??? Is their /lib totally empty? Am I supposed to try every script type to map /lib contents? I\u0026rsquo;ll go broke!\nOn the Right Track Hit the search engine for guides. Nothing.\nRecalled the error: Can't find metaxploit library in the /lib path or the current folder. I only saw /lib and metaxploit before. But \u0026ldquo;or the current folder\u0026rdquo;? Did that mean my local script directory? Would I need to download every libssh.so-like dependency just to run an exploit?\nChecked the black market, no libssh.so or similar. Recalled apt-get exists in-game (like real Linux). Ran apt-get search ssh. Bingo, libssh.so popped up. apt-get install libssh.so to install SSH.\nInstalled. Ran SSHPasswd 54.44.37.52 22. Still got Can't find metaxploit library in the /lib path or the current folder.\nSeriously, I\u0026rsquo;m out!!!\nBack to HackShop. Scrolled through Tools. metaxploit.so jumped out. Wait, isn\u0026rsquo;t that the \u0026ldquo;metaxploit\u0026rdquo; from the error? Pair that with \u0026ldquo;current folder\u0026rdquo; – was it missing this all along?\nDownloaded it to the script dir (/home/yexca/hacktool). Since scanrouter only saw Kernel_router.so, I ran KernelRouterAccess 54.44.37.52. Boom! Access granted!\nGaining Access Got access, first thought: delete logs. FileExplorer.exe to /var/system.log. Permission denied. Guest access, great. Tried /etc/passwd for password files. Still Permission denied. (Seriously, I probed almost every file).\nUgh, what\u0026rsquo;s the point of this script then?!\nSSH script changes passwords, too risky. Switched to the HTTP script to grab passwords. HttpPasswd 54.44.37.52 80. Got: can't read /etc/passwd. Permission denied. Saw I was still guest. I was like\u0026hellip;\nEnded up using the SSH script. SSHPasswd 54.44.37.52 22, new password 114514. Successfully changed Farraze\u0026rsquo;s password.\nRan ssh Farraze@114514 54.44.37.52, got into the victim\u0026rsquo;s machine. cat /etc/passwd pulled the encrypted root password info.\nLocally, touch mima.txt, pasted the root password info, then decipher mima.txt. Root password: 44444 (seriously?).\nexit to disconnect. ssh root@44444 54.44.37.52 got me in as root.\nInside the Machine First thing inside: delete logs. Users: Ralancl, Farraze. No Daronane. Still a forum user? Scoured the machine, found zip. (Transferred their cash to my account, btw~).\nMission brief mentioned 172.16.6.7.\nping 172.16.6.7. \u0026ldquo;Ping successful\u0026rdquo;. My own machine couldn\u0026rsquo;t ping it (obvious, it\u0026rsquo;s an internal network).\nnmap 172.16.6.7 for open ports. Got command not found.\nUgh, guess I\u0026rsquo;ll have to drop my command binaries into /bin on this machine.\nCopied. Ran nmap 172.16.6.7 again. Port 3306 open, service employees. What\u0026rsquo;s employees?\nSearch engine confirmed: 3306 is usually a DB port. SQL script time.\nPassword Acquired Hit HackShop, searched scripts. Found one: \u0026ldquo;Take advantage of a vulnerability in the sql service to inject a new password to a registered user.\u0026rdquo; Requirement: \u0026ldquo;Any user logged in the computer.\u0026rdquo; DB creation implies users logged in.\nDownloaded. SqlChangePasswd 172.16.6.7 3306. Error: Connection refused. Address unreachable. Access denied. Right, DBs are usually whitelisted.\nMoved script and metaxploit.so to victim\u0026rsquo;s /root. Retried the command, set password to 114514 for user Osquel.\nOkay, now what? Password changed, but only 3306 is open. Can\u0026rsquo;t get in! XD\nAlright, back to HackShop. Script search. Found one: \u0026ldquo;Prints the contents of the file /etc/passwd\u0026rdquo;. Requirement: \u0026ldquo;Any user logged in the computer.\u0026rdquo; Same as the last one.\nDropped the script into victim\u0026rsquo;s /root. SqlPrintPasswd 172.16.6.7 3306. Got all user passwords, Daronane included.\nCopied to my machine, decrypted: password pierra.\n??? Sent the password to the client. Confirmed???\nSeriously\u0026hellip;\nEpic! (From YouTuber Hei Biaoke)\nAfterword Got the password via email from the start. Then I spent ages getting it again. (Speechless, seriously).\nGot 200, but my scripts cost way more (net loss, lol). Still, scripts are reusable, and the exploration was pretty fun!\nGuides for this game are practically nonexistent. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for one, hope this helps!\n","date":"2022-08-03T22:41:06+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/54/","title":"Logging My First Grey Hack Mission (Password Acquisition)"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by Gemini-3-flash Written by Hiyoung Original Article: https://blog.hiyoung.icu/2022/08/03/0b5e2db181ab/ I\u0026rsquo;ve been using GitHub a lot lately to store code from my learning process.

It\u0026rsquo;s definitely better to write these things down for future reference.\nIn this article, the Wi-Fi that the OpenWRT router connects to is referred to as the \u0026ldquo;upstream router,\u0026rdquo; and the OpenWRT device itself is the \u0026ldquo;router.\u0026rdquo;\nPrerequisites Ensure the LAN IP address of your router (the one used to access the web UI) is different from the upstream router\u0026rsquo;s address. If they conflict, you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to access the internet.\nChanging the Router\u0026rsquo;s LAN Address Go to Network -\u0026gt; Interfaces, click Edit for the LAN interface, and change its IPv4 address.\nFor example, if the upstream router is at 192.168.1.1, you can change your router to 192.168.5.1.\nAfter clicking Save \u0026amp; Apply, use the new address in your browser to access the router\u0026rsquo;s backend.\nConnecting the Router to Wi-Fi Go to Network -\u0026gt; Wireless, click Scan, find the Wi-Fi you want to connect to, and click Join Network. Enter the network name and password, click Submit, and then click Save \u0026amp; Apply.\nSetting up the Router\u0026rsquo;s Wi-Fi Hotspot If your router is dual-band (2.4G and 5G), it\u0026rsquo;s best to create your hotspot on a different band than the one used for the relay for maximum compatibility. (If the other band already has a Wi-Fi network active, it might already be ready to use.)\nIf you only have a single band, you must create a new network on that same band. Note that this may not always work, as some hardware doesn\u0026rsquo;t support simultaneous receiving and transmitting on a single radio.\nSetting up the Wi-Fi follows the standard process: go to Network -\u0026gt; Wireless, add a network, enter the SSID (Wi-Fi name) and password, then Save \u0026amp; Apply.\nReferences OpenWrt Advanced Tutorial: Wireless Relay Configuration Guide - iyzm.net ","date":"2022-06-23T14:50:21+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/49/","title":"OpenWRT Wireless Relaying"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash This article was written by Hiyoung Original article: https://blog.hiyoung.icu/2022/08/18/5be9517606f2/ Batch Process Images with Photoshop Automation Scripts Click Window -\u0026gt; Actions in the menu bar (Shortcut: Alt+F9).

Well, my miHoYo BBS cookies expired and needed replacing, so I\u0026rsquo;m documenting the process for future reference.\nTools \u0026amp; Original Tutorial Genshin Impact Helper - Yindan\u0026rsquo;s Blog The original post covers many methods, which can be a bit cluttered. This post focuses on the specific method I use.\nTencent Cloud Function Cleanup Make sure to freeze your Tencent Cloud Functions to avoid any unexpected charges.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t need the service anymore, you can cancel your account, but be aware that account deletion requires a photo of you holding your ID.\nPrerequisites Your server must be able to reach miHoYo\u0026rsquo;s servers: https://mihoyo.com Run ping mihoyo.com in your SSH terminal to verify connectivity.\nOne of my servers couldn\u0026rsquo;t connect, so I had to switch to another one.\nDocker Installation Use the official one-click script. It\u0026rsquo;s verified to work on Debian 10 and CentOS 7 (use the root account).\nInstallation command:\n1 curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | bash -s docker --mirror Aliyun For users in Mainland China, you can use the DaoCloud mirror:\n1 curl -sSL https://get.daocloud.io/docker | sh Script Installation Pull the image with the following command:\n1 docker pull yindan/genshinhelper CentOS Error I encountered a Can't Connect to Docker Daemon error on CentOS.\nEnsure you are root, then run:\n1 systemctl start docker Basic Usage Getting the Cookie To get your miHoYo Cookie, refer to: Genshin Resin Tracker/Push – yexca\u0026rsquo;Blog Note: The Cookie must include the account_id and cookie_token fields.\nFor multiple accounts, separate Cookies with a #, for example: Cookie1#Cookie2#Cookie3.\nSimple Configuration 1 2 3 4 docker run -d --name=genshinhelper \\ -e COOKIE_MIHOYOBBS=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;COOKIE_MIHOYOBBS\u0026gt;\u0026#34; \\ --restart always \\ yindan/genshinhelper:latest Just replace \u0026lt;COOKIE_MIHOYOBBS\u0026gt; with your actual Cookie.\nReconfiguring/Updating Cookies To reconfigure, you usually need to remove and redeploy the container.\nAlternatively, if using a configuration file, you just need to swap the Cookie (though Cookies tend to last a long time).\nCommon Commands 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 # View all Docker containers docker ps -a # View logs docker logs -f genshinhelper --tail 100 # Restart docker restart genshinhelper # Update docker pull yindan/genshinhelper docker rm -f genshinhelper # Then redeploy using the basic or advanced method # Uninstall docker rm -f genshinhelper docker image rm yindan/genshinhelper Advanced Usage You can download the example file and modify it.\nGithub: config.json Telegram: https://t.me/genshinhelperupdates/5 Installation Assuming your config file is at /etc/genshin/config.json, use this command to map the volume:\n1 2 3 4 docker run -d --name=genshinhelper \\ -v /etc/genshin:/app/genshincheckinhelper/config \\ --restart always \\ yindan/genshinhelper:latest Configuration You can strip the config file down to only the parameters you need. If you only need the Cookie, it can look like this:\n1 2 3 { \u0026#34;COOKIE_MIHOYOBBS\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;COOKIE_MIHOYOBBS\u0026gt;\u0026#34; } Config Parameters RANDOM_SLEEP_SECS_RANGE: Random sleep range in seconds before check-in. Set to \u0026ldquo;0-0\u0026rdquo; to disable. CHECK_IN_TIME: Daily check-in time. This depends on the environment time, not the timezone. For Docker, set the timezone using TZ=Asia/Shanghai.

I just think she\u0026rsquo;s super cute (I didn\u0026rsquo;t even know it was Jia Ran at first). Yeah, this thing has quite a few bugs, and autostart doesn\u0026rsquo;t always trigger, but she\u0026rsquo;s just too adorable!\nThis extension also lets you change the background, but I\u0026rsquo;m not a big fan of that, so I skipped it.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s How It Looks Installation Open VS Code, then search for A-SOUL-live2d in Extensions and install it.\nExtension link: A-SOUL-live2d - Visual Studio Marketplace Honestly, you can just check the extension page for the installation process; no need to read my crappy article.\nBasic Usage Once installed, restart VS Code. Then, at the very bottom of the Explorer view, you\u0026rsquo;ll see LIVE2D-A-SOUL. Expand it (if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t expand, restart VS Code again).\nNext, in Supplementary Settings, click Generate plugin dependency files. Restart VS Code, then click Start live2d.\nJia Ran will pop up in the bottom right corner! You can hover your mouse over her, drag the third icon in the top right to move her position, and click the first icon to change her size.\nAfter adjusting her position and size, you can enable Autostart in Configuration Info, then click Save Current Configuration. Now, Jia Ran will appear every time you open VS Code~\nOther Features The following is copied from the plugin description:\nBasic Operations\nStart/Stop live2d: Self-explanatory. Starts the live2d character, defaulting to the bottom right. Save Current Configuration: After adjusting live2d size, scale, and drag position, you can save the settings. They\u0026rsquo;ll be loaded automatically next time. Reset Default Position: Use this if the current position is abnormal and cannot be dragged. [Scaling also resets] Background Image Click to Switch: The button is the second icon to the right of the character. Save Background Image: Only works if a background image is currently present. Only one can be saved; clicking again will overwrite the old one. Load Background Image: Loads the saved background image. Timed Switching: Self-explanatory. Check if the switch button is spinning to determine if the timed function is enabled. Background Image Style Configuration Download Background Image Configuration Info\nAutostart: Self-explanatory. When enabled, live2d will automatically start when VS Code launches. Positioning Dependency: The corner used for character positioning. Supplementary Settings\nPlugin Dependency Files: Plugin dependency files are automatically generated when the plugin is first installed and launched. Generate: If live2d fails to start normally, try clicking this button to force regeneration and overwrite existing configuration. Remove: Before uninstalling this plugin, please try to perform this operation first. It can remove all modifications the plugin made to VS Code files. Character Features\nGaze follows mouse [Drawback: Currently unable to follow across the entire page] Click Interaction A-SOUL Fan Navigation Website Entry Switch Background Image Switch Model Skating Rink Audio Test A-SOUL Fan-Created Content Website Entry Model Source Regarding Warnings Using it will pop up a Code corruption warning. The original author states:\nThis plugin runs by modifying VS Code\u0026rsquo;s JS files, so it will show the following prompt during first installation or VS Code upgrades. Please select [Don\u0026rsquo;t show again].\nAudio Support The current plugin only has a simple voice test; for now, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to consider this feature.\nVS Code\u0026rsquo;s Electron version does not include ffmpeg , so you need to replace the built-in ffmpeg dynamic link library for normal playback (you\u0026rsquo;ll need to replace it after every VS Code update).\nVS Code for Windows 1.31.0 - 1.35.1 didn\u0026rsquo;t require replacement; versions 1.36.0 and later don\u0026rsquo;t have this luxury.\nVS Code for macOS 1.43+ crashes after replacement Solution Uninstallation First, Remove from Supplementary Settings, then uninstall the plugin from the Extensions view.\n","date":"2022-06-01T06:01:00+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/45/","title":"Jia Ran in the Bottom Right Corner of VS Code"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by Gemini-3-flash Introduction I recently set up a personal page using GitHub Pages (it\u0026rsquo;s gone now), so here\u0026rsquo;s a quick guide on how to build a site and use a custom domain.\nThis post doesn\u0026rsquo;t cover complex site generators, since I basically just wrote a single Markdown file.\nCreate a GitHub Repository First, sign up for a GitHub account. Once logged in, create a new repository .\nThe Repository name should be username.github.io. For example, if my GitHub username is yexca, I would enter yexca.github.io.\nGit Environment Setup On Windows, just download and run the installer from the official Git website.\nAfter installation, open Git Bash and run the following commands:\n1 2 git config --global user.name \u0026#34;Your Name\u0026#34; git config --global user.email \u0026#34;email@example.com\u0026#34; Replace Your Name with your name and email@example.com with your email.\nFor example:\n1 2 git config --global user.name \u0026#34;yexca\u0026#34; git config --global user.email \u0026#34;yexca@duck.com\u0026#34; GitHub Desktop Installation If you\u0026rsquo;re already familiar with Git (though if you were, why are you reading this?), you can skip this step.\nGo to the GitHub Desktop website to download and install it.\nClone the Repository Open GitHub Desktop, log in, and clone the repository you just created to a local folder.\nThe app will show the repository interface with some quick actions on the right.\nI use VS Code, so I\u0026rsquo;ll click \u0026ldquo;Open in Visual Studio Code\u0026rdquo;.\nBuild the Site Create a README.md file and edit it using Markdown (shameless plug for my own Markdown notes).\nOnce edited and saved, go back to GitHub Desktop, click \u0026ldquo;Commit to main\u0026rdquo;, then click \u0026ldquo;Push origin\u0026rdquo;.\nNow, visit username.github.io to see your site. (If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t show up immediately, give it a few minutes).\nCustom Domain GitHub Pages Go to your repository settings, find \u0026ldquo;Pages\u0026rdquo; on the left, enter your custom domain under \u0026ldquo;Custom domain\u0026rdquo;, and click \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo;.\nNote: You can also choose a Jekyll theme here.\nDNS In your domain\u0026rsquo;s DNS settings, add a CNAME record pointing your domain to username.github.io, where username is your GitHub username.\nHTTPS For some reason, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get HTTPS working directly through GitHub, so I used Cloudflare .\nEnable the proxy in DNS settings, then under \u0026ldquo;SSL/TLS\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Edge Certificates\u0026rdquo;, toggle on \u0026ldquo;Always Use HTTPS\u0026rdquo;.\nOther Site Builders Since I didn\u0026rsquo;t need a full blog, I just used a simple file. If you want a real blog, check out these tools:\nJekyll : Officially supported by GitHub. VuePress : Great for Markdown-centric sites. Gitbook: Good for documentation sites.

This thing is super useful, so I\u0026rsquo;m writing up some learning notes.\nYou can learn on the go with an online editor , or download a desktop editor .\nMy preferred Markdown editor is Typora .\nFor a quick refresh, check out the official Markdown Syntax Cheat Sheet .\nHeadings To create a heading, just use # + space + heading text. There are six levels, mapping to HTML\u0026rsquo;s h1-h6.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 # This is a H1 ## This is a H2 ### This is a H3 #### This is a H4 ##### This is a H5 ###### This is a H6 For general web writing, the H1 is usually the page title, H2s start the main content, and you\u0026rsquo;ll probably use up to H4.\nLine Breaks Just add two or more spaces at the end of a line, then hit Enter. Some editors might add a line break directly.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 这是第一行 //这里有俩空格，后面也有→ 这是第二行 Result:\nThis is the first line // two spaces here, and more after →\nThis is the second line\nItalics \u0026amp; Bold For italics, wrap text with a single *. For bold, use two **.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 3 *This is italics* **This is bold** ***This is italic and bold*** Result:\nThis is italics\nThis is bold\nThis is italic and bold\nBlockquotes To create a blockquote, just add \u0026gt; + space + content at the start of a paragraph.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 3 \u0026gt; This is a level 1 blockquote \u0026gt;\u0026gt; This is a level 2 blockquote \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; This is a level 3 blockquote Result:\nThis is a level 1 blockquote\nThis is a level 2 blockquote\nThis is a level 3 blockquote\nLists You can create ordered and unordered lists.\nOrdered Lists Just add number + . + space + content before each list item.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 3 1. First item 2. Second item 3. Third item Result:\nFirst item Second item Third item Unordered Lists Use +, -, or * + space + content. But don\u0026rsquo;t mix them (for compatibility).\nSub-items can be indented with four spaces or a TAB, then formatted like the parent item.\nHowever, to comply with markdownlint standards, try to use the same symbol for all unordered lists in an article, like always using -.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 - First item - First item sub-item one - First item sub-item two - First item sub-item two sub-item one - Second item - Third item Result:\nFirst item First item sub-item one First item sub-item two First item sub-item two sub-item one Second item Third item Code Inline Code Wrap content you want to turn into inline code with backticks ( ). If your code contains a backtick, use double backticks ( ).\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 `Turn this content into a code block` ``This content contains a \u0026#39;`\u0026#39; oh~`` Result:\nTurn this content into a code block\nThis content contains a '`' oh~\nCode Blocks You can indent each line with four spaces or a TAB.\nAlternatively, wrap the code with triple backticks (```) on the lines above and below. For syntax highlighting, specify the language after the opening triple backticks.\nTo follow best practices, use the triple backtick method.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` C include\u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; int main(void) { printf(\u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34;); } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Result: ``` C include\u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; int main(void) { printf(\u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34;); } Horizontal Rules On a separate line, use three or more *, -, or _.\nFor consistency, it\u0026rsquo;s best to use three asterisks.\nFor example, this code:\n1 *** Result:\nLinks Simple Links Just wrap the URL or email address with \u0026lt;\u0026gt;.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 \u0026lt;https://yexca.net\u0026gt; \u0026lt;yexca@duck.com\u0026gt; Result:\nhttps://yexca.net yexca@duck.com Links with Custom Text [Link text](URL \u0026quot;Optional Title\u0026quot;). The \u0026quot;Optional Title\u0026quot; part can be omitted.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 [yexca\u0026#39;s Blog](https://blog.yexca.net) [yexca\u0026#39;s Blog](https://blog.yexca.net \u0026#34;Actually, it\u0026#39;s yexca and Hiyoung\u0026#39;s blog\u0026#34;) Result:\nyexca\u0026rsquo;s Blog yexca\u0026rsquo;s Blog Reference-Style Links For example, this code:\n1 2 3 4 [blog]: https://blog.yexca.net [contact]: \u0026lt;mailto:yexca@duck.com\u0026gt; This is my [personal blog][blog]. If you have questions, you can [contact me][contact]. Result:\nThis is my personal blog . If you have questions, you can contact me .\nImages Embedding Images ![Alt text](Image URL \u0026quot;Optional Title\u0026quot;). Alt text shows if the image fails to load, and Optional Title appears on hover.\nNote: Some Markdown editors don\u0026rsquo;t support Optional Title (like this site\u0026rsquo;s theme). For best practice, at least ensure Alt text is provided.\nFor example, this code:\n1 ![Image](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/yexca/picx-images-hosting@master/2023/04-网站背景/blog-background.2p10z489pjc0.webp \u0026#34;This is the background of this site\u0026#34;) Result:\nImage with a Link Use the link syntax, but put the image syntax inside the [].\nFor example, this code:\n1 [![Image](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/yexca/picx-images-hosting@master/2023/04-网站背景/blog-background.2p10z489pjc0.webp)](https://www.pixiv.net/artworks/82542737) Result:\nEscaping Characters If you have characters you don\u0026rsquo;t want Markdown to format, just add a \\ before them.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 I want to type *but this will be italic* Adding an escape character \\* will prevent italics and display the character Result:\nI want to type but this will be italic\nAdding an escape character * will prevent italics and display the character\nEmbedded HTML You can use HTML directly. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example with the \u0026lt;details\u0026gt; tag.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \u0026lt;details\u0026gt; \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; Click me \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; Found you! \u0026lt;/details\u0026gt; I can use Markdown **for bold**, and also HTML \u0026lt;i\u0026gt;for italics\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt; at the same time. Since this site\u0026rsquo;s theme doesn\u0026rsquo;t directly parse HTML5, I won\u0026rsquo;t demonstrate it live.\nTables Use three or more - for column headers, | to separate columns, and : for left, right, or center alignment (optional).\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 3 |Title|Content|Notes| |:---|:---:|---:| |Left-aligned|Centered|Right-aligned| Result:\nTitle Content Notes Left-aligned Centered Right-aligned Note: You cannot add headings, blockquotes, lists, images, or HTML tags inside tables.\nStrikethrough Add ~~ before and after the text you want to strike through.\nFor example, this code:\n1 I will always love ~~Dr. War Literature~~ Warma Result:\nI will always love Dr. War Literature Warma\nTask Lists Use - + space + [ ] or [x] + space + content.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 - [ ] This isn\u0026#39;t done yet - [x] This one is finished Result:\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t done yet This one is finished Using Emojis Copy and Paste In most cases, you can directly copy emojis from Emojipedia and paste them. Just ensure your web encoding is UTF-8.\nUsing Emoji Shortcodes This requires Markdown application support, using colons : at the beginning and end.\nYou can look up shortcodes via the Emoji Shortcode List .\nFor example, this code:\n1 :blush:,:smiley: Result:\n😊,😃\nFootnotes Similar to citations or superscripts in academic papers.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 This references Wikipedia[^1], and this references Github[^2]. You can also use English, but no spaces or TABs[^yexca]. [^1]: You can use text here, which will appear at the corresponding position above. [^2]: Or use a link [Github](https://github.com/yexca) [^yexca]: [Personal Homepage](https://lit.link/yexca) Result: The references appear at the very end of the article. Click the superscript to view them.\nThis references Wikipedia1, and this references Github2. You can also use English, but no spaces or TABs3.\nNote: Some editors don\u0026rsquo;t support this.\nReferences Official Markdown Tutorial Learning Markdown You can use text here, which will appear at the corresponding position above.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nOr use a link Github \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nPersonal Homepage \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"2022-05-28T00:59:23+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/43/","title":"Markdown Basics (Learning Notes)"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Introduction I can connect to the game directly, but using a game booster or VPN blocks access.

When using the mv command, make sure the destination directory exists, or it will simply rename the file. Creating a hard link is essentially giving a file an additional name (the data itself remains unchanged). It\u0026rsquo;s similar to creating a pointer to that file in C. Symbolic links are like shortcuts in Windows. You can clearly see the difference using the ls -li command. Hard links have the same byte count as the source file, while symbolic links do not. Creating commands with alias: Use ; to run multiple commands on the same line. Use type to check if a command already exists in the system. Note that aliases created this way disappear when the shell session ends (since they aren\u0026rsquo;t saved to a file). Use unalias to remove an alias. Using \u0026gt; redirects and overwrites the target file, while \u0026gt;\u0026gt; appends to it. To write error messages to a file instead of displaying them on the screen, use 2\u0026gt;. There are two ways to redirect both standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) to the same file: first, add 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 after the filename; second, use \u0026amp;\u0026gt; as the redirection operator.

Basics 1.1 Linux File System Directory Structure Source: Runoob Small arrows in the diagram indicate that the file\u0026rsquo;s actual location is elsewhere.\n/bin: Short for Binaries. Contains the most frequently used commands. /boot:\nCore files used for starting Linux, including bootloader files and kernel images. /dev:\nShort for Device. Contains external device files. In Linux, devices are accessed just like files. /etc:\nShort for Etcetera. Contains all system management configuration files and subdirectories. /home:\nUser home directories. Every user has their own directory, usually named after their account (e.g., alice, bob, eve). /lib:\nShort for Library. Contains basic dynamic shared libraries, similar to DLL files in Windows. Almost all applications require these libraries. /lost+found:\nUsually empty. Contains file fragments recovered after an illegal system shutdown. /media:\nLinux automatically recognizes devices like USB drives and optical drives and mounts them here. /mnt:\nUsed for temporary mounting of other file systems. You can mount an optical drive to /mnt/ to view its contents. /opt:\nShort for optional. Directory for installing extra software (e.g., an ORACLE database). Empty by default. /proc:\nShort for Processes. A virtual file system (pseudo file system) storing files representing the current kernel state. It resides in memory, not on the hard drive. You can access it for system info.\nExample: Disable ping with echo 1 \u0026gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all. /root:\nThe home directory for the system administrator (superuser). /sbin:\nShort for Superuser Binaries. Contains system management programs used by the admin. /selinux:\nSpecific to Redhat/CentOS. SELinux is a security mechanism similar to a firewall but more complex. This directory stores SELinux-related files. /srv:\nStores data required by services after they start. /sys:\nIntroduced in the 2.6 kernel. It installs the sysfs file system, which integrates information from proc (processes), devfs (devices), and devpts (pseudo-terminals). It reflects the kernel device tree. /tmp:\nShort for temporary. Used for storing temporary files. /usr:\nShort for Unix Shared Resources. An important directory containing many user applications and files, similar to \u0026ldquo;Program Files\u0026rdquo; in Windows. /usr/bin:\nApplications used by system users. /usr/sbin:\nAdvanced management programs and system daemons for the superuser. /usr/src:\nDefault location for kernel source code. /var:\nShort for variable. Contains files that frequently change, such as various log files. /run:\nA temporary file system storing info since the system booted. Files are cleared on reboot. If /var/run exists, it should point here. 1.2 Basic File Attributes 1.2.1 Attributes In Linux, the first character indicates whether the entry is a directory, file, or link.\nd: Directory –: File l: Link file b: Storage device interface (random access device) c: Serial port device, like a keyboard or mouse (one-time character device) The following characters are grouped in threes, using rwx. r is read, w is write, and x is execute. If a permission is missing, it\u0026rsquo;s replaced by a dash –.\nFile attributes are defined by the first 10 characters (see below).\nFrom left to right (0-9):\nBit 0 is the file type. Bits 1-3 are owner permissions. Bits 4-6 are group permissions. Bits 7-9 are permissions for others.\n1, 4, 7 represent read (r). 2, 5, 8 represent write (w). 3, 6, 9 represent execute (x).\n1.2.2 Linux File Owner and Group 1. chgrp: Change group Syntax:\n1 chgrp [-R] groupname filename Options:\n-R: Recursive change. Apply to all files and subdirectories. 2. chown: Change owner (and group) Syntax:\n1 2 chown [-R] ownername filename chown [-R] ownername:groupname filename Example: Change install.log owner to bin in the home directory (~):\n1 2 3 4 [root@www ~] cd ~ [root@www ~]# chown bin install.log [root@www ~]# ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 bin users 68495 Jun 25 08:53 install.log Change it back to root:root:\n1 2 3 [root@www ~]# chown root:root install.log [root@www ~]# ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 68495 Jun 25 08:53 install.log 3. chmod: Change permissions Two methods: Numeric and Symbolic.\nThere are nine basic permissions: owner/group/others, each with read/write/execute.\nNumeric values:\nr: 4 w: 2 x: 1 Sum the values for each identity. For example, -rwxrwx—:\nowner = rwx = 4+2+1 = 7 group = rwx = 4+2+1 = 7 others = \u0026mdash; = 0+0+0 = 0 Total: 770.\nSyntax:\n1 chmod [-R] xyz file_or_dir Example: Set .bashrc to full permissions:\n1 2 3 4 5 [root@www ~]# ls -al .bashrc -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 395 Jul 4 11:45 .bashrc [root@www ~]# chmod 777 .bashrc [root@www ~]# ls -al .bashrc -rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 395 Jul 4 11:45 .bashrc For -rwxr-xr–, the score is [4+2+1][4+0+1][4+0+0]=754.\n4. Symbolic permission changes Use u (user), g (group), o (others), and a (all).\n| chmod | u g o a | +(add) -(remove) =(set) | r w x | file/dir | |---|---|---|---|---| Set permissions to -rwxr-xr–:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 touch test1 // Create test1 ls -al test1 // Check default perms #-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Nov 15 10:32 test1 chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=r test1 // Modify perms ls -al test1 -rwxr-xr-- 1 root root 0 Nov 15 10:32 test1 Remove execute permission for everyone:\n1 2 3 chmod a-x test1 ls -al test1 #-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Nov 15 10:32 test1 1.3 vim Text Editing 1.3.1 Three Vim Modes Vim has three main modes: Command mode, Insert mode, and Last line mode (often referred to as general mode in some contexts).\n1.3.2 vim Shortcuts Refer to: https://www.runoob.com/linux/linux-vim.html 1.4 Network Configuration 1.4.1 VMware Network Modes Bridged Mode: VM connects directly to the external network (visible to outside). The host acts as a bridge. The VM gets its own IP from the router.\nNAT Mode: Host and VM create a private network. NAT translates the VM\u0026rsquo;s IP (VM is invisible to outside). Since the host and VM are on different subnets, a virtual network card (VMnet8) connects the host to the VM\u0026rsquo;s LAN.\nHost-only Mode: VM communicates only with the host. No Internet connection.\n1.4.2 Configuring Static IP Refer to: Setting Static IP in VM (CentOS example) 1.4.3 Configuring Hostname 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 hostname # View current hostname vim /etc/hostname # Edit hostname # Reboot to apply # Method 2 hostnamectl set-hostname ... # Takes effect immediately 1 2 # Modify hosts file vim /etc/hosts 1.5 System Management 1.5.1 service Management An executing program or command is a \u0026ldquo;process.\u0026rdquo;\nA process that remains in memory after starting is a \u0026ldquo;service.\u0026rdquo;\n1 2 3 systemctl start|stop|restart|status servicename # Basic syntax /usr/lib/systemd/system/ # Service directory ","date":"2022-04-19T02:53:27+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/38/","title":"Systematic Linux Study Notes"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by Gemini-3-flash Introduction OBS launched on Steam on March 22, 2022.

So I looked into it and wrote this article to document the process. Note: It seems auto-play only works in PC mode. Of course, you can try casting your desktop in VR (doge).\nWithout Using a MIDI File I. Setup To enable automatic piano playback, you\u0026rsquo;ll need two software tools and one browser plugin.\n1) loopMIDI This software is available directly from the official website: loopMIDI-Tobias Erichsen (tobias-erichsen.de) Direct download link: loopMIDISetup_1_0_16_27.zip (May be outdated due to version updates)\n2) Jazz-Plugin When installing, keep the default installation path, otherwise, it might not work correctly.\nWindows: Click to download (Plugin official link) (If the official link doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, you can also click here to download )\nMac OS X: Click to download Linux version: Click to download 3) Browser Plugin: Jazz-MIDI Chrome, Opera, or other Chromium-based browsers (e.g., 360 Secure Browser): Click to install from Chrome Web Store If You Can\u0026rsquo;t Access the Chrome Web Store For Chrome versions before 73, download and use Jazz-MIDI-crx2.crx . For Chrome 73 and later, download and use Jazz-MIDI-crx3.crx .\nAccessing Extensions in Chrome Type (or click here directly) chrome://extensions into the address bar and press Enter to access extensions. As shown: Accessing Extensions in Edge Type (or click here directly) edge://extensions/ into the address bar and press Enter to access extensions. As shown: If a pop-up appears, click Manage extensions.\nAfter Opening the Extensions Interface First, enable \u0026lsquo;Developer mode\u0026rsquo;. In Chrome, it\u0026rsquo;s top-right; in Edge, it\u0026rsquo;s mid-left.\nThen, simply drag the downloaded .crx file into the extensions interface.\nII. Steps 1) Open loopMIDI, Create a New Project To create a new project, enter a name in the bottom-right New port-name field, then click the + (plus) button in the bottom-left.\nOnce done, the project will appear at the top. Here, we\u0026rsquo;ll use Hello World as the project name.\n2) Start Playback \u0026lt;1\u0026gt; Find the Song to Play First, open the website MidiShow – Leading MIDI Music Exchange and Download Site Register, log in, then search for the song you want to play.\n\u0026lt;2\u0026gt; Configure Playback Settings As shown, using Hand in Hand as an example, click the Playback Settings button.\nConfigure as shown. For MIDI Output Device, select the project you just created with loopMIDI, which is Hello World here.\n\u0026lt;3\u0026gt; Start Playing Now, go next to the piano in the Chinese World, select the bench, sit down, and then click play on the webpage.\nIf Using a MIDI File First, ensure the MIDI file is a piano score. Multi-track files might get messy, so edit them yourself if needed.\nI.

I found a tutorial by WGzeyu in the Steam reviews. Since my goal is simple, and their tutorial is quite comprehensive, I\u0026rsquo;m writing this article to summarize it.\n1. Preparation Note: Update 2022.03.25: I checked today and mods for 1.20.0 are available. See step two directly. The data restoration section has also been updated.\n1) Downgrading The current latest version, 1.20.0, doesn\u0026rsquo;t have mods yet. So, you need to downgrade. You can upgrade again after mods are updated.\n\u0026lt;1\u0026gt; Download version 1.19.0 or earlier You can download from this cloud drive provided by WGzeyu . Choose the version you want and download it.\nDirect link: 1.19.0 steam version \u0026lt;2\u0026gt; Replace the 1.20.0 version Extract the downloaded file. Then, open the game\u0026rsquo;s directory via Steam. Go up one level, rename the \u0026ldquo;Beat Saber\u0026rdquo; folder to \u0026ldquo;Beat Saber 1.20.0\u0026rdquo;. Then, rename the downloaded file to \u0026ldquo;Beat Saber\u0026rdquo; and move it into this folder.\n\u0026lt;3\u0026gt; How to restore data \u0026lt;1\u0026gt; Use Steam to open the game directory. Delete \u0026ldquo;Beat Saber IPA\u0026rdquo; from the UserData folder. \u0026lt;2\u0026gt; Copy the following folders (copy as needed):\nUserData (Mod settings) CustomSabers (Lightsaber models) CustomPlatforms (Stage models) CustomAvatars (Avatar models) CustomNotes (Block models) \u0026lt;3\u0026gt; Navigate to the \u0026ldquo;Beat Saber 1.20.0\u0026rdquo; folder.

Official website: ResilioSync Direct link: ResilioSync 64-bit 3) Folders The software mentioned above, except for ResilioSync, are single-file applications. You can place them in a folder for common software.\nYou also need to create a folder where you want to store your songs, e.g., \u0026ldquo;E:\\games\\Beat Saber Song\\\u0026rdquo;. Any location is fine.\n2. Steps 1) Launch Beat Saber once 2) Open \u0026ldquo;ModAssistant\u0026rdquo; Click \u0026ldquo;Agree\u0026rdquo; to access the \u0026ldquo;Mod\u0026rdquo; interface on the left.

Since Koikatu is my favorite, I decided to give it a try. However, I encountered several issues, so I’m documenting them here. Note: the VR version has no story mode, and I used the vanilla version of the game, so there were fewer problems overall.\nPrerequisites / Conditions Some of the following images and text are from the official Oculus Support page . I translated some parts myself, but since my English isn\u0026rsquo;t great, please refer to the official content for accuracy. For full details, see Oculus Link compatibility requirements .\nCable Requirements Oculus Link requires a high-quality USB cable that supports both data and power. For comfort and usability, the cable should be at least 3 meters (10 feet) long.\nPC Requirements Component Recommended Specs CPU Intel i5-4590 / AMD Ryzen 5 1500X or better GPU See table below RAM 8 GB or more OS Windows 10 USB Port At least one USB port Supported GPUs for Oculus Link NVIDIA GPUs Supported Not Supported NVIDIA Titan Z X NVIDIA Titan X X NVIDIA GTX 970 X GTX 1060 (Desktop, 3GB) X GTX 1060 (Desktop, 6GB) X GTX 1060M X GTX 1070 (all) X GTX 1080 (all) X GTX 1650 X GTX 1650 Super X GTX 1660 X GTX 1660 Ti X RTX 20-series (all) X RTX 30-series (all) X AMD GPUs Supported Not Supported AMD 200 Series X AMD 300 Series X AMD 400 Series X AMD 500 Series X AMD 5000 Series X AMD 6000 Series X AMD Vega Series X 1. Launching the Game To launch the VR version, simply open KoikatuVR.exe. Since this uses Steam streaming, you should start SteamVR beforehand.\nBefore playing, make sure to wear your headphones and lock your door to avoid\u0026hellip; unexpected situations. If you can’t, then just play responsibly (doge).\nProblem 1: Can’t Enter SteamVR Step 1: Ensure All Required Software Is Installed 1) Install SteamVR Open Steam, press Win+R, enter steam://run/250820, and hit enter. This will trigger the installation of SteamVR.\n2) Install Oculus Software Go to the Oculus setup page . After installation, additional files will be downloaded, and you’ll be prompted to log in. Make sure your network is working properly.\nIf asked for a payment method, look for a “Skip” button.\nStuck on Loading at Login? You can fix this by modifying your hosts file. I recommend using Huorong (a Chinese antivirus tool) to edit it safely.\nIf you don’t use Huorong, go to C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc, find the file named hosts, and open it with Notepad.\nAdd the following lines at the end:\n1 2 3 4 5 157.240.11.49 graph.oculus.com 157.240.11.49 www2.oculus.com 157.240.8.49 scontent.oculuscdn.com 157.240.8.49 securecdn.oculus.com Save the file. If you\u0026rsquo;re not using Huorong, save it elsewhere first and move it back, removing any .txt extension.\nStep 2: Check the Link Cable The Oculus app will prompt you to test the Link cable during setup. If you skipped it, go to Devices \u0026gt; Quest2 and Touch - USB Test to test again.\nStep 3: Check Settings 1) Quest2 Device Settings When you connect your Quest2 via USB, it will ask if you want to allow data access. Select “Deny.” If you allowed it by mistake, unplug and reconnect, then choose “Deny.”\n2) Oculus Software Settings SteamVR will prompt you to allow “unknown sources.” Click “Allow.”\nAlternatively, go to Settings \u0026gt; General \u0026gt; Unknown Sources in the Oculus software.\nStep 4: Still Not Working? Try This Sequence 1) Quest2 Device After connecting to your PC, you should see a popup asking to “Enable Oculus Link.” Click “Enable.”\nIf no popup appears, go to the Quick Settings panel on the bottom left and click “Oculus Link.”\n2) Start SteamVR Surely you know how to launch SteamVR\u0026hellip; right? (doge)\nIf your VR device is connected before starting Steam, the top-right corner of Steam should show a “VR” button. Click it to start.\nIf not, right-click the Steam icon in your system tray and select the second-last option — that’s SteamVR.\nOr enable the \u0026ldquo;Tools\u0026rdquo; view in your Steam library to find SteamVR listed there.\n2. Starting the Game I don’t really know what to write here — this section exists just to make Problem 2 game-related (doge).\nLaunching KoikatuVR.exe will auto-start SteamVR. So you can open KoikatuVR after launching Oculus Link on your Quest2.\nNote: The game also opens a window on your desktop. You can press Win+D to minimize all windows. But when you take off and put your headset back on, the window may reappear. Just a heads-up.\nProblem 2: Can’t Start the Game / Don’t Know How You might’ve read elsewhere or seen videos saying only certain devices are supported (I forgot which).\nIf you also tested “VR Kanojo” and assumed it uses eye tracking to select — that’s incorrect (I thought so too lol).\nJust press the joystick to bring up a selection line, then use the front trigger to confirm.\n(See 3. Controls for more input info.)\nProblem 3: White Screen After Starting / Stuck on Loading Go to the Koikatu DL page and scroll down to download the コイカツ VR パッチ.\nDirect link: VR Patch Download Unzip the file and run the executable. It’ll create a コイカツ！VR_0531 folder. Copy the contents of the setup folder into your game directory and overwrite when prompted.\nNote: According to the original author, this patch may limit positions to only three. I didn’t verify it myself since I didn’t play far. I initially wanted to play the story in VR, but that’s not supported. Here’s their (edited) fix:\nYou need to use the positions in Story Mode first, then they become available in VR. So just go through all positions during battles, then save at night, exit, switch to VR, and they’ll be available.\nSource (Chinese): Anyone Tried the VR Version? 3. Controls These are based on personal gameplay and only cover the basics. For full controls, consult other guides.\n1) Starting the Game You’ll see two options after launch:\nスタート = Start エンド = End Press the joystick to show a selection line, and confirm with the front trigger.\n2) In-Game Interface Text will appear near your wrist. Use the Y and B buttons to switch tabs.\nThere are two tabs normally and a third (Move) during combat:\nJapanese English Description Function アクション Action Actions Front trigger to act, side trigger for menu, joystick to select システム System System Settings Front trigger to reset position 移動 Move Movement Hold front trigger to rotate view 3) Notes You can only use the joystick to select options while on the “アクション” (Action) tab.\nReferences Oculus Link Official Anyone Tried the VR Version?

The networks we typically use (including the internet) operate based on the TCP/IP suite, and HTTP is a subset of it. For devices on the internet to communicate, they must follow common rules, which we call protocols. (TCP/IP is a general term for various internet-related protocol families, including but not limited to: PPPoE, HTTP, TCP, IP, UDP, IEEE 802.3, etc.)\nThe TCP/IP protocol suite is structured in layers, from top to bottom: Application Layer, Transport Layer, Network Layer, Data Link Layer.\nInternet protocol suite - Wikipedia When communicating using the TCP/IP protocol suite, the client moves down from the Application Layer, and the server moves up from the Data Link Layer. As the client transmits data between layers, each layer adds its header information. Conversely, the server removes headers layer by layer. This method of wrapping data is called encapsulation.\n1.2 IP, TCP, and DNS 1.2.1 IP Protocol The IP protocol operates at the Network Layer. The \u0026ldquo;IP\u0026rdquo; in TCP/IP refers to the IP protocol itself, not an IP address. The IP protocol\u0026rsquo;s job is to send various data packets to their destination. Different IP addresses can be paired with MAC addresses. While IP addresses can change, MAC addresses generally do not. An IP address specifies the address assigned to a node, while a MAC address is the fixed address belonging to a network interface card (NIC).\n1.2.2 MAC Address Communication between IPs relies on MAC addresses. Typically, the ARP protocol is used to find the corresponding MAC address for a given IP address.\n1.2.3 TCP Protocol Layer-wise, TCP is in the Transport Layer, providing a Byte Stream Service. This means it manages large chunks of data by splitting them into smaller segments for easier transmission. In short, TCP segments data to make large transfers simpler and can also confirm if data successfully reached the other party.\nTo confirm data delivery, TCP uses a three-way handshake. This handshake uses TCP flags: SYN (synchronize) and ACK (acknowledgement).\n1.2.4 DNS Service for Domain Name Resolution Computers can be assigned both IP addresses and hostnames/domain names. The DNS protocol provides services to look up IP addresses from domain names, or vice-versa, to find domain names from IP addresses.\n1.3 URL and URI 1.3.1 Differences and Relationship Compared to URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), we\u0026rsquo;re more familiar with URL (Uniform Resource Locator). URLs are what you type into a web browser to access web pages, like https://www.bilibili.com/ . A URI identifies a resource on the internet using a string, while a URL indicates the resource\u0026rsquo;s location (its address on the internet). So, a URL is a subset of a URI. A URI can be a locator (URL), a name (URN), or both. A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is like a person\u0026rsquo;s name, while a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is like their address. In other words, a URN defines what something is, and a URL provides how to find it.\n1.3.2 URI Format To represent a specific URI, you can use an absolute URI, absolute URL, or relative URL, all of which contain the necessary information.\nA relative URL is specified from the browser\u0026rsquo;s base URI, for example, /image/logo.gif.\nAbsolute URI format:\nLogin Info (Authentication): Specifies a username and password for authentication when retrieving resources from the server. This is optional.\nServer Address: When using an absolute URI, you must specify the server address to access. This can be a DNS-resolvable name like hackr.jp, an IPv4 address like 192.168.1.1, or an IPv6 address enclosed in square brackets, such as [0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1].\nServer Port Number: Specifies the network port number for connecting to the server. This is also optional; if omitted, the default port is used automatically.\nHierarchical File Path: Specifies the file path on the server to locate the specific resource. This is similar to the directory structure in UNIX systems.\nQuery String: For resources within the specified file path, you can pass arbitrary parameters using a query string. This is optional.\nFragment Identifier: A fragment identifier typically marks a sub-resource within the retrieved resource (a specific location within a document). However, its usage is not explicitly defined in RFCs . This is also optional.\nChapter 2: The Simple HTTP Protocol 2.1 HTTP Introduction HTTP is a stateless protocol. This means the HTTP protocol itself doesn\u0026rsquo;t save the communication state between each request and response. So, cookie technology was introduced to maintain state. (Note: This HTTP book was published earlier. Current state management technologies are achieved through a combination of cookies, sessions, and tokens .)\n2.2 Common HTTP Methods GET: Retrieve resources\nThe GET method is used to request the resource specified by the URL. The server processes the specified resource and returns the response content.\nPOST: Transmit entity body\nPOST is used to send data to the server. It\u0026rsquo;s also employed when the data to be transmitted (e.g., in a request body) is too large.\nDifferences between GET and POST:\nLet\u0026rsquo;s cut to the chase: there\u0026rsquo;s no fundamental difference between GET and POST methods; it\u0026rsquo;s mostly about message format.\nRequest Parameter Length Limit: GET requests are typically limited to ~1024KB (browser/server dependent), while POST has no inherent limit on request data. Request Parameters: GET request parameters are passed via the URL, with multiple parameters joined by \u0026lsquo;\u0026amp;\u0026rsquo;. POST request parameters are placed in the request body. Request Caching: GET requests can be cached, while POST requests are not, unless manually configured. Security: POST is considered more secure than GET. GET requests are harmless on browser back, but POST may re-submit the request. History: GET request parameters are fully retained in browser history, while POST parameters are not. Encoding: GET requests only support URL encoding, while POST supports various encoding types. Parameter Data Types: GET typically only accepts ASCII characters (after URL encoding), while POST has no such restriction.\nAdditionally, HTTP includes other methods like PUT, HEAD, and DELETE , which we won\u0026rsquo;t detail here.\n2.3 HTTP Persistent Connections (Three-way Handshake, Four-way Wave) The characteristic of persistent connections is that the TCP connection remains active as long as neither end explicitly requests to close it.\nThree-way handshake: Establishes TCP connection. Four-way wave: Terminates TCP connection.\nWith persistent connections, pipelining allows sending the next request without waiting for the previous response.\n2.4 State Management with Cookies Cookies instruct the client to save a Cookie based on the \u0026lsquo;Set-Cookie\u0026rsquo; header field information sent in the server\u0026rsquo;s response. The next time the client sends a request to that server, it automatically includes the Cookie value in the request message.\nCookie information is generated by the server and sent to the client for storage.\nChapter 3: HTTP Message Information 3.1 HTTP Request and Response Message Structure Information exchanged using the HTTP protocol is called an HTTP message. HTTP messages from the requesting party (client) are called request messages, and those from the responding party (server) are called response messages. They consist of an 8-bit byte stream and are transmitted via HTTP communication.\nRequest Line: Contains the request method, request URI, and HTTP version.\nStatus Line: Contains the status code indicating the response result, a reason phrase, and the HTTP version.\nHeader Fields: Contain various headers representing conditions and attributes of the request and response. Generally, there are four types of headers: General Headers, Request Headers, Response Headers, and Entity Headers.\nOther: May include headers not defined in HTTP RFCs (e.g., Cookie).\n3.2 Encoded and Chunked Transfer HTTP uses encoding during data transmission to improve transfer speed.\n3.2.1 Differences Between Message Body and Entity Body Entity: Transmitted as payload data (supplementary item) in a request or response, its content consists of an entity header and an entity body.\nThe HTTP message body is used to transmit the request or response entity body. Typically, the message body equals the entity body. A difference between them only arises when encoding operations modify the entity body\u0026rsquo;s content during transmission.\n3.2.2 Chunking Entity Bodies for Transfer When transferring large amounts of data in HTTP communication, splitting the data into multiple chunks allows browsers to display pages progressively. This feature of chunking the entity body is called chunked transfer encoding. Chunked transfer encoding divides the entity body into multiple chunks. Each chunk is marked with its size in hexadecimal, and the last chunk of the entity body is marked with \u0026ldquo;0(CR+LF)\u0026rdquo;.\nThese \u0026ldquo;chunks\u0026rdquo; are also commonly referred to as \u0026ldquo;packets\u0026rdquo;.\nChapter 4: HTTP Status Codes for Return Results 4.1 Status Code Categories Status codes let users know if the server processed the request successfully. There are many types, but only about 14 are commonly used.\n4.2 2XX Success 4.2.1 200 OK Indicates that the client\u0026rsquo;s request was successfully processed by the server. The information returned with the status code in the response message varies depending on the method used.\n4.2.2 204 No Content This status code means the server successfully processed the request, but the returned response message contains no entity body.\n4.3 3XX Redirection We\u0026rsquo;ll focus on 301 and 302 redirects. Other status codes can be looked up independently.\n4.3.1 301 Moved Permanently A 301 redirect is a permanent redirection. This status code indicates that the requested resource has been assigned a new URI, and future requests should use the URI now pointing to that resource. For example, if you forget to add a trailing slash \u0026ldquo;/\u0026rdquo; to a resource path like the one below, a 301 status code might be generated.\nhttp://excample.com/sample\n4.3.2 302 Found A 302 redirect is a temporary redirection. This status code indicates that the requested resource has been assigned a new URI, and the client (for this time) is expected to access it using the new URI.

We\u0026rsquo;ll focus on 404 Not Found.\n4.4.1 404 Not Found This status code indicates that the requested resource could not be found on the server. It can also be used by the server to deny a request without specifying a reason.\n4.5 5XX Server Errors 5XX responses indicate an error occurred on the server itself.\nChapter 5: Web Servers 5.1 Communication Data Forwarding: Proxies, Gateways, Tunnels 5.1.1 Proxy A proxy server\u0026rsquo;s basic function is to receive a client\u0026rsquo;s request and forward it to another server. Proxies don\u0026rsquo;t alter the request URI; they send it directly to the upstream target server holding the resource. It\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that \u0026ldquo;proxy\u0026rdquo; usually refers to a client-side proxy (also called a forward proxy), while a reverse proxy acts on behalf of the server.\nUsing a proxy server can reduce network bandwidth by leveraging caching, and sometimes proxies are used for information security.\nCaching Proxy When forwarding responses, a Caching Proxy saves a copy (cache) of the resource on the proxy server beforehand. When the proxy receives another request for the same resource, it can return the cached resource as a response instead of fetching it from the origin server.\nReverse Proxy Reverse proxies offer many benefits:\nHides the IP address of the server (cluster) from clients. Security: Acts as an application layer firewall , providing protection against web-based attacks (e.g., DoS / DDoS ) and making it easier to identify malware , etc. Uniformly provides encryption and SSL acceleration for backend servers (clusters) (e.g., SSL termination proxy). Load balancing : If a server in the cluster is heavily loaded, the reverse proxy uses URL rewriting to retrieve the requested resource from a less-loaded server or a backup. Provides caching services for static content and dynamic content with high access requests in a short period. Performs compression on some content to save bandwidth or provide service to networks with poor bandwidth.\n5.1.2 Gateway Gateways operate very similarly to proxies. However, a gateway enables servers on the communication path to provide services using non-HTTP protocols.\n","date":"2022-03-16T23:56:48+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/29/","title":"Summary and Discussion After Reading 'Illustrated HTTP'"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by Gemini-3-flash Note This article is mirrored from 《unity学习笔记》——将MMD模型导入unity for personal reference.

Hosting them on your own server consumes quite a bit of bandwidth, and the loading speeds aren\u0026rsquo;t always great. This is where image hosting comes in. However, most free image hosts suffer from disappearing images or slow speeds, so I started looking into self-hosted solutions.\nRenting a dedicated cloud server just for images is too expensive, and most paid image hosts have traffic or storage limits. Eventually, I stumbled upon a project: an image hosting management tool based on GitHub API \u0026amp; jsDelivr that features built-in CDN acceleration.\nAbout PicX Official Website: PicX Image Hosting Project Address: XPoet/picx: An image hosting management tool based on GitHub API \u0026amp; jsDelivr with CDN acceleration Official Documentation: Quick Start - PicX Features: Just choose a GitHub repository as your storage, then complete the Token binding and configuration on the PicX official website . No download or installation required. It\u0026rsquo;s that simple.\nQuick Start 1. Create a New GitHub Repository Click this link: Create a New Repository Enter a Repository name (e.g., image-hosting).\nThe repository visibility must be set to Public.\n2. Create a GitHub Token with repo Permissions Click this link: New personal access token Fill in the Note (e.g., picx-image-hosting).\nNote: \u0026ldquo;Expiration\u0026rdquo; is the validity period of this Token. Please choose carefully. If you encounter issues later because you didn\u0026rsquo;t set this correctly, refer to: Using PicX to upload images prompts \u0026ldquo;Bad credentials\u0026rdquo; – yexca’Blog Under Select scopes, check the repo box, then click Create Token.\nWarning: The newly generated Token is only displayed once. Save it securely. If you lose it, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to regenerate it.\n3. Configure the Token on the Official Site Open the PicX Website , go to the image hosting configuration, and paste your Token.\nThen, choose your repository and directory style:\nNew Directory: Manually enter a new directory name. (Use / for multi-level directories, e.g., A01/A02. Supports up to three levels.) Root Directory: Images will be stored directly in the repository\u0026rsquo;s root.

Programs on Linux systems always read the system\u0026rsquo;s Kernel time. Every time Linux boots, the Kernel first reads the hardware clock settings (though the hardware time might not be accurate then). After that, the system clock runs independently of the hardware clock. So, to permanently change Linux time and keep it accurate, you need to permanently update the hardware clock. Otherwise, upon reboot, the system time will revert to the old hardware time. Linux Clock Commands For the system (Kernel) clock, use timedatectl or date.

Allocates a block of memory of length size in the dynamic storage area. The return value is a pointer (type void *) to the starting address of the allocated space. If the function fails (e.g., insufficient memory), it returns a NULL pointer.\ncalloc function 1 void *calloc(unsigned n, unsigned size); Allocates n continuous blocks of memory, each of length size, in the dynamic storage area. It returns a pointer to the starting address, or NULL if allocation fails. calloc is useful for dynamic arrays, where n is the number of elements and size is the element size.\nfree function 1 void free(void *p); Releases the memory pointed to by p, making it available for other variables. p must be a value returned by a previous calloc or malloc call. free has no return value. Note: In older C versions, malloc and calloc returned char * pointers; ANSI C defines them as void *.\nImplementing a Dynamic Linked List 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 #include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt;

SQL ORDER BY Keyword The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result set by one or more columns.\nBy default, ORDER BY sorts records in ascending order. To sort records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.\nSQL ORDER BY Syntax 1 2 3 SELECT column_name, column_name FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name1, column_name2 ASC|DESC; – ASC stands for ascending, DESC stands for descending.\n– The ORDER BY clause should be placed at the end of the script. When sorting multiple columns, the database sorts by column_name1 first, then column_name2, and so on.\n2. Deleting All Data (DELETE and DROP TABLE) You can delete all rows in a table without deleting the table itself. This keeps the table structure, attributes, and indexes intact: DELETE FROM table_name;\nOr:\nDELETE * FROM table_name;\nNote: Be extremely careful when deleting records! You can\u0026rsquo;t undo this action.\nDROP TABLE Statement The DROP TABLE statement is used to delete a table entirely: DROP TABLE table_name\nNote: Unlike DELETE, DROP TABLE removes both the table data and the structure. This is also irreversible.\nDROP DATABASE Statement The DROP DATABASE statement is used to delete a database: DROP DATABASE database_name\nTRUNCATE TABLE Statement If you only need to wipe the data inside a table but keep the table itself, use the TRUNCATE TABLE statement: TRUNCATE TABLE table_name\n3. SQL JOIN SQL JOINs are used to combine rows from two or more tables.\nThe image below illustrates 7 common usages related to LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, INNER JOIN, and OUTER JOIN.\nINNER JOIN: Returns rows if there is at least one match in both tables (INNER JOIN is the same as JOIN). LEFT JOIN: Returns all rows from the left table, even if there are no matches in the right table. RIGHT JOIN: Returns all rows from the right table, even if there are no matches in the left table. FULL JOIN: Returns rows if there is a match in either of the tables. Note: Join statements in SQL correspond to the connection concepts in database theory. LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and INNER JOIN correspond to natural joins, while FULL JOIN corresponds to a Cartesian product.\n4. SQL Constraints 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 CREATE TABLE table_name ( column_name1 data_type(size) constraint_name, column_name2 data_type(size) constraint_name, column_name3 data_type(size) constraint_name, .... ); NOT NULL – Ensures a column cannot store NULL values. UNIQUE – Ensures every row in a column has a unique value. (A table can have multiple UNIQUE constraints but only one PRIMARY KEY; PRIMARY KEY automatically includes a UNIQUE constraint). PRIMARY KEY – A combination of NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each record in a table. Helps in finding specific records faster. FOREIGN KEY – Ensures referential integrity by matching data in one table to values in another. CHECK – Ensures the values in a column meet specific conditions. DEFAULT – Sets a default value for a column when no value is specified. 5. AUTO INCREMENT Field Usually, we want the primary key value to be created automatically every time a new record is inserted.\nIn SQL Server, we use the IDENTITY field to achieve this.\nThe following SQL defines the \u0026ldquo;ID\u0026rdquo; column in the \u0026ldquo;Persons\u0026rdquo; table as an auto-increment primary key:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 CREATE TABLE Persons ( ID int IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY, LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL, FirstName varchar(255), Address varchar(255), City varchar(255) ) In this example, the starting value for IDENTITY is 1, and it increments by 1 for each new record.\nTip: To start the \u0026ldquo;ID\u0026rdquo; column at 10 and increment by 5, change it to IDENTITY(10,5).\nWhen inserting into the \u0026ldquo;Persons\u0026rdquo; table, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to specify a value for the \u0026ldquo;ID\u0026rdquo; column (it\u0026rsquo;s added automatically):\n1 2 INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName,LastName) VALUES (\u0026#39;Lars\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Monsen\u0026#39;) The SQL above inserts a new record where \u0026ldquo;ID\u0026rdquo; gets a unique auto-generated value, \u0026ldquo;FirstName\u0026rdquo; is \u0026ldquo;Lars\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;LastName\u0026rdquo; is \u0026ldquo;Monsen\u0026rdquo;.\n6.

It doesn\u0026rsquo;t include a compiler or many other features, so you need to install the compiler yourself.\nStep 1: Download the software from the VS Code official website: Visual Studio Code – Code Editing. Redefined Step 2: We need to download a compiler. For C, we use GCC. Link: MinGW-w64 – for 32 and 64 bit Windows download | SourceForge.net . Select x86_64-posix-seh from the latest version. The website download might be slow, so here is a Baidu Netdisk link provided below.\n(Baidu Netdisk \u0026ldquo;Rapid Transfer\u0026rdquo; link: b48357234368d9ba439fc0db6e86531d#84cbf1dc60abe4fff77d035540ea3132#140697937#mingw64.zip)\n(Standard Baidu Netdisk link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/17FYT\\_Y-s-I2yajFc2MICqw Code: ewis )\nStep 3: Add E:\\mingw64\\bin to your system environment variables (adjust the drive letter based on your actual installation path).\nFor Win11: Open Settings -\u0026gt; System -\u0026gt; About -\u0026gt; Advanced system settings -\u0026gt; Environment Variables -\u0026gt; System variables -\u0026gt; Click Path -\u0026gt; Edit -\u0026gt; Browse -\u0026gt; Add the corresponding folder.\nStep 4:\nPress Win+R, run cmd (don\u0026rsquo;t skip this step). Type gcc. It should return no input files rather than \u0026ldquo;\u0026lsquo;gcc\u0026rsquo; is not recognized as an internal or external command\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;The term \u0026lsquo;gcc\u0026rsquo; is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.\u0026rdquo; If you see the latter, your GCC folder isn\u0026rsquo;t in the Path environment variable. If you added it and it still fails, restart your PC. If it still doesn\u0026rsquo;t work after a restart, you likely missed a step.\nType gcc -v to see the version. If the version displayed is different or older than the one you just downloaded, it means there\u0026rsquo;s an older compiler already in your Path (possibly from another IDE). You\u0026rsquo;ll need to remove the old GCC path from your Path variable.\nThese validations must pass; otherwise, you have to fix your environment variables.
