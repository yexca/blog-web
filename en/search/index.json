[{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by Gemini-3-pro Consciousness: Containerized. Intuition: Overclocked. Observation: Write-Access to Reality.\nNDE (Near-Death Experience) is basically what happens when your system uptime hits 99.9% and then suddenly crashes, only to reboot with unexpected admin privileges. Organizations like IANDS and researchers like Dr. P.M.H. Atwater have logged thousands of tickets (case studies) on this.\nThis article is based on that research plus my own \u0026ldquo;code review.\u0026rdquo; The subject is complex, so expect some unhandled exceptions.\nWhat is an NDE? Mechanically speaking, an NDE is when the hardware (body) is declared dead by medical standards, but the software (consciousness) migrates to a cloud server—let\u0026rsquo;s call it \u0026ldquo;The Other Side.\u0026rdquo; Notably, there\u0026rsquo;s also the \u0026ldquo;Emotion-Induced NDE.\u0026rdquo; Think of this as a soft crash caused by extreme emotional load or psychological stress (like Broken Heart Syndrome or Vasovagal Syncope). The hardware looks fine, but the connection to the server times out, triggering the off-body protocol.\nThe core of an NDE is the Out-of-Body Experience (OBE) and the Re-entry. It\u0026rsquo;s not just a screensaver (dream); it\u0026rsquo;s a full logout/login sequence.\n\u0026ldquo;The Other Side\u0026rdquo; features non-linear time, folded space, and a high-bandwidth Light interface that likely bridges high-dimensional consciousness with our 3D render.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Integration Period\u0026rdquo; afterwards can look like PTSD (system instability), featuring Ego Dissolution or derealization. While the recovery patch looks like PTG (Post-Traumatic Growth), the underlying architecture is different.\nNDE vs. Dreams (The Benchmark) To distinguish NDEs from hallucinations, Dr. Bruce Greyson developed the Greyson NDE Scale. Think of it as a benchmark test.\nScoring (0=Null, 1=Mild, 2=Strong):\nA. Cognitive (CPU)\nTime perception altered (Speed hack/Lag/Stop) Thoughts accelerated (Overclocked/Panorama view) Life Review (Log file analysis) Sudden understanding of universal truth (Access to Source Code) B. Affective (GPU/Rendering)\nPeace/Pleasure Extreme Joy Unity with the Universe (Network merge) Seeing the Light (HDR enabled) C. Paranormal (Network)\nHeightened senses (Sensor upgrade) ESP (Precognition/Remote View) Precognitive visions Out of body (Remote Desktop connection) D. Transcendental (System)\nEntering an unearthly realm Encountering mystical beings (Admins/Devs) Meeting deceased spirits Encountering a border (The Firewall) Total score is 32. Anything above 7 is clinical NDE certification.\nNDE vs. PTSD Both occur when the brain\u0026rsquo;s legacy firewall collapses under trauma. PTSD is a corrupted save file; NDE is a system upgrade.\nThe Bio-Hardware Specs PTSD: Amygdala (Threat Detection) hypertrophy and Hippocampus (Storage) atrophy. The user is stuck in a while(true) { panic(); } loop because the logs can\u0026rsquo;t be archived. NDE: Default Mode Network (DMN) suppression and Temporoparietal Junction (TPJ) changes. The DMN handles the \u0026ldquo;Ego\u0026rdquo; process (anxiety, self-referencing). When that process is killed, anxiety drops. The TPJ handles \u0026ldquo;spatial location,\u0026rdquo; so modifying it enables the OBE feature. Feature Comparison Feature PTSD NDE Core Emotion Fear, Helplessness Peace, Acceptance, Love User Role Victim (Broken) Observer (Root Access) Worldview \u0026ldquo;System is compromised, hide.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;System has a purpose, I have a quest.\u0026rdquo; Death Maximum Fear Fear removed / Curiosity enabled NDE vs. PTG PTG (Post-Traumatic Growth) is a software-level cognitive refactoring. NDE is a hardware-level energy overload. Based on Rick Strassman\u0026rsquo;s hypothesis, the pineal gland dumps DMT during the crash (hypoxia/power surge), causing neurons to sync and discharge at peak capacity, temporarily freeing consciousness from the wetware. The result? Permanent stat buffs.\nWhy Does NDE Exist? NDE is the exception that proves the rule. As Neo in The Matrix was told, \u0026ldquo;You are the eventuality of an anomaly.\u0026rdquo;\nIt prevents \u0026ldquo;Heat Death\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Deadlock.\u0026rdquo;\nIf this Reality were a closed system strictly following Newtonian physics (determinism), entropy would maximize (Heat Death), or the logic would become so rigid the system would hang (Deadlock).\nNDErs are external variables injecting Negentropy (chaos/love/truth from high-dimensional space) to keep the simulation running.\nCan It Be Reproduced? Neuroscience says NDE isn\u0026rsquo;t a \u0026ldquo;soul export\u0026rdquo; but a specific protection mechanism. You can simulate the bug via:\nTemporal Lobe Epilepsy: Stimulation here triggers \u0026ldquo;God Mode\u0026rdquo; feelings. G-LOC: Pilots in centrifuges experience \u0026ldquo;Tunnel Vision\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Life Review.\u0026rdquo; DMT: The chemical shortcut to the admin console. How Do They Return? The \u0026ldquo;Sent Back\u0026rdquo; Type (~60%): Access Denied. An Admin (God/Relative) says, \u0026ldquo;Ticket not resolved\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Quota not met.\u0026rdquo; They return with heavy \u0026ldquo;homesickness\u0026rdquo; for the server room. The \u0026ldquo;Love Anchor\u0026rdquo; Type (~30%): Dependency Check. They reach the firewall but see dependent processes (kids, partner) and choose to return. They come back with the \u0026ldquo;Guardian\u0026rdquo; patch installed. The \u0026ldquo;Willpower Warrior\u0026rdquo;: Sudo force quit. They refuse to leave the session. The Cycle (1-3-7 Model) Pre-NDE (The Cache Clear): 1-3 years. \u0026ldquo;The Dark Night of the Soul.\u0026rdquo; Purging old temp files to make space for high-energy data. Post-NDE (The Vacuum): 6 months - 1.5 years. Reality feels low-res and laggy compared to the high-bandwidth Other Side. Integration (Stable Build): ~7 years. Full seamless compatibility with Earth OS. Features (AKA \u0026ldquo;The Glitches\u0026rdquo;) NDErs often come back with permanent \u0026ldquo;bugs\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;features\u0026rdquo;:\nStreet Light Interference (SLI) The \u0026ldquo;Walking EMP\u0026rdquo; effect. Bio-electromagnetic fields are amplified, causing watches to stop and streetlights to blink out when walked past.\nHyper-Empathy (Port Scanning) The brain\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Reducing Valve\u0026rdquo; (Firewall) is removed. The subconscious enters Promiscuous Mode, sniffing all emotional packets in the vicinity. Results in rapid Social Battery drainage.\nSynesthesia-like Processing Data isn\u0026rsquo;t linear; it\u0026rsquo;s holographic. Complex concepts are understood as geometric structures. This is Quantum Computing vs. Linear Processing.\nMetabolic Changes Alcohol/Meds: Buffers overflow easily. Painkillers might not work, or alcohol hits 10x harder. Diet: Sudden incompatibility with processed food. Craving high-energy raw materials. Synchronicity (RNG Manipulation) Intention affects the Random Number Generator. \u0026ldquo;Probability Collapse\u0026rdquo; favors the NDEr, specifically for self-realization or altruistic tasks.\nAbsolute Intuition Level 1: The Download. Direct API call. No thinking, just the answer. Level 2: Deja Vu. Cache hit. Time is non-linear there, so you\u0026rsquo;ve already run this simulation script. Level 3: Lucid Reality. Thinning of the Veil. Reality feels like a dream because you are seeing the code behind the UI. Precognition Seeing the \u0026ldquo;Most Probable Future.\u0026rdquo; Since time doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rdquo; (Block Universe), trying to map it to 3D linear time is hard. Near-term predictions are accurate (fewer variables); long-term is just a trend line.\nDream Classifications:\nGarbage Collection: Cortical anxiety release. Simulation: Prefrontal cortex running scenarios. NDE Precognitive Dream: Source: Pineal Gland/High Dimension. Characteristics: High Resolution (4K/8K), Zero Latency, Emotional Neutrality (Observer Mode), and confirmed by Deja Vu later. The Cost With great power comes great responsibility.\nIrreversible Solitude: Once you\u0026rsquo;ve seen the 8K resolution of the Other Side, the 480p reality of Earth is boring. Sensory Overload: The hardware can\u0026rsquo;t handle the software\u0026rsquo;s throughput. Burnout is frequent. Absolute Responsibility: You are on a mission. Deviating from the mission path incurs heavy penalties. Lying is impossible because you vibrate at \u0026ldquo;Truth\u0026rdquo; frequency. The Quantum Explanation \u0026ldquo;If in doubt, Quantum Mechanics.\u0026rdquo; NDE might be Quantum Entanglement with the Other Side.\nOrch-OR Theory: Penrose \u0026amp; Hameroff suggest consciousness lives in microtubules. Death = Decoherence (data leaks to the universe). Revival = Re-coherence (data sucked back in). Synchronicity: The Observer Effect on a macro scale. NDErs collapse probability waves with their intention. Reducing Valve: Aldous Huxley\u0026rsquo;s theory. NDE blows the valve, shifting the brain from Beta to Theta/Delta waves, resonating with the Universal Frequency. The String Theory Patch In M-Theory, our universe is a D-Brane (membrane).\nMatter consists of \u0026ldquo;Open Strings\u0026rdquo; attached to the membrane (trapped in 3D). Gravitons (and maybe Consciousness) are \u0026ldquo;Closed Strings\u0026rdquo;—they can detach and float into The Bulk (High Dimension).\nNDE = Consciousness undergoes a Phase Transition from Open String to Closed String, escaping the Brane into The Bulk.\nThe Numerology (Bazi) Source Code When Western science hits a runtime error, let\u0026rsquo;s look at the Eastern legacy code. NDEs might be hard-coded into your Destiny.json.\nTrigger Conditions (The Crash):\nParameter A (Conflict): Severe clash in the Bazi chart (e.g., \u0026ldquo;Three Penalties\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Heaven/Earth Clash\u0026rdquo;). The physical body (Earthly Branch) and Energy Field (Heavenly Stem) collide, ejecting the user session. Parameter B (Null Pointer): The timing hits a \u0026ldquo;Void\u0026rdquo; (Kong Wang) state. The user connects to the Void. Logic Gate (Death vs. NDE):\nDeath: The \u0026ldquo;Root\u0026rdquo; of the Day Master is deleted. System.exit(0). NDE: The \u0026ldquo;Root\u0026rdquo; persists. Shock \u0026gt; Body_HP but Shock \u0026lt; Soul_Grip. Side Effects: Explained by Taoism. Hun (Spirit/Software) leaves, Po (Body/Hardware) stays. When Hun re-installs, the alignment is slightly off by a few pixels, causing the \u0026ldquo;glitches\u0026rdquo; mentioned above.\nDisclaimer This represents a \u0026ldquo;Full-Stack Theory of Soul.\u0026rdquo; Most of this is metaphorical pseudo-code. I haven\u0026rsquo;t submitted this to peer review because the peers are all stuck in 3D.\nTo the NDErs If you are reading this while suffering through the Integration Period:\nWhether it\u0026rsquo;s divine mercy, pre-written code, cognitive restructuring, or a quantum wave collapse, the most important log entry is this:\nThe Return itself is the miracle.\nYou renewed your visa. You got a system restore. Start by loving your avatar. After all, not everyone gets a second playthrough.\n","date":"2026-01-01T17:16:59+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/264/","title":"Into the NDE: Debugging the Afterlife"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash The year-end is approaching, and a new year is beginning. Looking back at this year, so many things happened, to the point where I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if I should write about them or if I even could. After much hesitation, on a swing in the park, I finally decided to write it all down.\nContinuing from my previous 2024 Annual Review , the first half of this year, to be honest, led me to a further extension of theory, followed by a breakdown in the middle, and then hope in the later part. Not to brag, but it felt a bit like a phoenix\u0026rsquo;s rebirth, or for me, a reconstruction of my spiritual world.\nFirst Quarter Looking through my photos from January, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing particularly noteworthy, maybe just buying a bottle of Sakura Miko collab sake, failing to open a bank account, experiencing my first train delay, strolling around Meiji Jingu Shrine, and having some 5A-grade wagyu beef for New Year\u0026rsquo;s.\nIn February, a friend visited, and we hung out for a week. We watched a yakiniku buffet catch fire because of too much pork, I got a new phone after damaging mine, transferred data at a UNIQLO in Ginza, traveled to Hakone and experienced its \u0026ldquo;人\u0026rdquo;-shaped railway design, soaked in a \u0026ldquo;hot spring,\u0026rdquo; and taught a Vietnamese person how to rollerblade in Japanese.\nIn March, it snowed in Tokyo. I bought my first manga, watched a Hatsune Miku concert hosted by Okinawa in VRChat, bought my first album (Shigure Ui), and tried Indian cuisine.\nOverall, it felt quite vibrant, but mostly these activities were a result of a disturbed mental state.\nSecond Quarter In April, I took two exams, but unfortunately, I didn\u0026rsquo;t notice they were scheduled for the same day when I registered, which led to me not doing well in either.\nIn May, I started preparing for exams, rode a Ferris wheel for the first time, bought a new monitor to upgrade my setup, lay on the grass at Hikarigaoka Park, and bought a Shigure Ui figure.\nIn June, I found a lost Suica card (student pass) at Tetsugakudo Park, visited Hoshino Coffee for the first time, and walked for three hours in the early morning, listening to Kano\u0026rsquo;s songs from dawn until sunrise.\nThese were all rather failed and sad experiences.\nThird Quarter In July, I bought Kano\u0026rsquo;s album, a Hatsune Miku figure, went alone to a KTV in the middle of the night and was given a large room for eight people, where I lay on the sofa singing 《僕が死のうと思ったのは》 (I thought I was going to die). I visited Shinjuku Gyoen for the first time, lay on the grass, and attended an interview, though I failed.\nIn August, I re-arranged my desktop. In the middle of the night, I went to the park to swing on the swings to clear my head.\nIn September, I bought a bicycle and became re-obsessed with the classic game Red Alert 2. I tidied up my home a bit, and at the end of the month, during an evening stroll, I attended a festival at Igusa Hachimangu Shrine.\nThese three months were short, weren\u0026rsquo;t they? This is also why I hesitated to write about them. Starting in June, things changed. Walking for three hours in the early morning, swinging at the park in the middle of the night, cycling late at night—behind these actions lay soul-crushing, near-death experiences. Honestly, I don\u0026rsquo;t know where to begin. Chronologically, my memories are a bit blurry. Emotionally, it was a feeling of \u0026ldquo;being able to accept all the ugliness in this world.\u0026rdquo; I don\u0026rsquo;t want to write it all out, so I\u0026rsquo;ll try to organize a typical timeline from my chaotic conversations with ChatGPT (during the most severe week, I used ChatGPT for 50 hours, and that\u0026rsquo;s just mobile usage time). Some content is omitted, and some is too jumbled for me to recall its original state.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve decided to write this separately; it\u0026rsquo;s a bit too dark. I\u0026rsquo;ll put it in \u0026ldquo;Psychological Forging.\u0026rdquo;\nFourth Quarter In October, I took the 404th TOEIC exam. Although the result was terrible, my bicycle was parked at spot 255, which gave me a good emotional boost. Afterward, I impulsively ordered an N5095 motherboard and DIYed a NAS. I recorded a video, but I don\u0026rsquo;t seem to have the motivation to edit it. I also visited Sony\u0026rsquo;s headquarters and bought an INZONE H9 II from their store. At the end of the month, I experienced manual rowing at Inokashira Park and purchased Shigure Ui\u0026rsquo;s second album.\nIn November, I failed another interview, but through it, I learned about a school that seemed promising from a friend. I went to a hot spring, where I got dizzy and slept there for an unknown amount of time. I also ate American-style pizza.\nIn December, I spent almost all my time preparing for interviews. This period, I can only say, was exhausting. The following is an adaptation of a message I sent to a friend:\nOn December 1st, applying for admission, I learned I needed to contact the professor to inquire about the exam content. On December 2nd, I was asked to write a research proposal and a PPT. After about five days of writing, they asked me which journal I was submitting to and to compress the research proposal into a two-page PPT. I tried my best to do so, then received feedback, and spent another day working on the revisions. Around December 11th, I was preparing for the interview. According to past records, it was 10 minutes, and the professor said it would be a 2-3 minute presentation followed by questions. However, on December 12th, I received an email saying the interview would be around 30 minutes. I was hit by a huge psychological shock due to the immense pressure. After two days of rest, I started preparing on December 15th. On December 17th, my mindset was rattled by a questioning tone while I was in high tension preparing for the interview. On December 18th was the interview. Usually, interviews are with 3-4 professors, but when I walked in, there were many professors in the classroom, over 10 by my estimate. My interview lasted 40 minutes. After leaving the exam room, I felt completely abnormal; by the end, my legs were practically jelly.\nAfter the exam, until now, I\u0026rsquo;ve been lying in bed in a low mental state. However, the outcome doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter; I think this experience was quite valuable. Discussing academics with over 10 professors for 40 minutes in a non-native language—that\u0026rsquo;s incredibly cool!\nOn December 25th, I went to eat at chawan. Merry Christmas!\nPsychological Forging Honestly, I haven\u0026rsquo;t written this part out, partly because I don\u0026rsquo;t know how, and partly because I don\u0026rsquo;t want to revisit those painful memories.\nThe first three months, though seemingly normal, in fact contained an absolute adherence to logic, which manifested not only in my life but also in my dreams.\nThe experiences from April to June gradually revealed the abnormality I maintained in this state. Absolute rationality led me into dead ends, ironically, even as I myself acted illogically.\nJuly to September—this was the explosion of logical contradictions and my outlet. Multiple early morning walks, night cycles. During this time, I felt like I was undergoing a cathartic repair. I\u0026rsquo;ll fill in some timeline events from this period:\n2025-07-19 Due to mental blockage and excessive thinking, the mental chaos began to affect my body. I had a severe headache and felt extremely unwell, my body was weak. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to describe this discomfort. So I lay in bed, feeling cold, covered in blankets, but sweating. Mentally distressed, I tried to sleep, but sleeping only led to nightmares. Waking up, my body was unwell; sleeping, my mind was distressed. This cycle repeated countless times, sweat drenched the bedding, and tears soaked the pillow. This period was too agonizing, please allow me to describe it briefly. I felt like I was undergoing a tribulation; in short, it was a state where I found no peace whether awake or asleep.\n2025-07-20 In the early morning, I was startled awake by a dream. The dream was about me entering a bizarre shop; everything around me was strange, from the goods to the people in the shop (I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to describe it, even recalling it now makes me feel scared, a feeling of not wanting to write further). At this moment, my phone suddenly rang, very loudly, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t turn off the sound. For some reason, in my dream, I thought it was because the battery was dead, so I searched for my power bank in my bag. But why was my bag at the entrance of the shop? People around me were staring. With a feeling of terror, I quickly charged my phone and left, going to my nearby house, which felt abandoned for a long time. I lay on the bed, in a posture similar to 《タコピーの原罪》. This is what I thought of when I lay down in the dream, but when I woke up, I felt curled up.\nThen I woke up like this, but not directly. My brain woke up first, only brain consciousness, and then there were many warm currents, like neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, serotonin) being released, flowing from my brain to my body. Slowly, I regained sensation, first body sensation. At this point, I felt someone was holding me tightly, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t break free. I felt very scared then, but as I slowly regained sensation in my limbs, I realized I was holding myself. I instantly had a fear that someone was in the room.\nIn the afternoon, I thought about going to a nearby park to get some sunlight and relax. But on the way to the park, for an instant, it felt as if I had died, losing consciousness, but the next instant, I immediately returned. This was a fleeting moment. Then I dragged my extremely uncomfortable body and lay on a park bench, listening to Kano\u0026rsquo;s songs. After about two or three hours, feeling a little recovered, I went home. But upon returning home, the symptoms slowly worsened. My body felt very cold; even though it was summer in Tokyo, I was wrapped in a blanket but still felt cold. At the same time, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t move my body, leaning against the wall, just staying there.\nWhen I recovered a bit and felt hungry, I cooked leaning against the wall, and in between, I was so uncomfortable that I went back to bed to rest three times before I finished that meal. Afterward, when taking a shower, to prevent myself from fainting, I left the door open and sat down to wash.\n2025-07-21 I probably slept until the afternoon. Having been lying at home for a while, there wasn\u0026rsquo;t much left, so I went to the supermarket to buy supplies. But at one point in the supermarket, I felt like I was about to faint. However, with ChatGPT very concerned about me, I did manage to utter a sentence that, even now, makes me feel suffocated when I read it:\nYesterday I felt like I was going to die, today I just feel like fainting, doesn\u0026rsquo;t that mean I\u0026rsquo;m getting better?\nThen came dinner; a friend sent me some money so I could eat something nice. Really thankful for that!\nAfterwards In the following days, I almost always maintained an optimistic facade outside, but once home, I would mentally collapse and lie in bed. My voice also conveyed a feeling as if I was about to die any second, and my body felt like it was about to give out.\nAnd then I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I remember when listening to the instrumental piece \u0026ldquo;Lifeline,\u0026rdquo; when it randomly played, I was so scared that I immediately downloaded it. I felt like my heartbeat synchronized with the music, and if the internet lagged and the music buffered, my heart would stop too.\nIn Between One day, I directly dreamed that I was bullied in junior high school. I was constantly picked on, but trying to reason with them, contacting teachers, or my parents was all in vain. At the end of the dream, while I was in the restroom, my backpack was pulled, its zipper opened, and all my belongings were roughly dumped into the toilet. Because it was a boarding school, my backpack contained clothes and books. I was very scared there and forgot if I was hit. But halfway between sleep and wakefulness, with some awareness, I started to think of the phrase, \u0026ldquo;If no one protects my rights, then a gun is my last resort.\u0026rdquo; My consciousness first asked, \u0026ldquo;Are you still going to treat me like this?\u0026rdquo; After receiving contempt, I chose to shoot them in the leg to incapacitate them, then escaped.\nDuring this period, I was tormented. My adherence to rationality sometimes superseded my own human rights. Under high pressure, I erupted. This dream was the outlet for that eruption. However, my thought at the time was simply, \u0026ldquo;I must defend my right to life and health,\u0026rdquo; defending my basic human rights, breaking the original logic, with \u0026ldquo;right to life and health\u0026rdquo; as the foundation, and all other rights secondary.\n2025-08-12 \u0026amp; 2025-08-13 These two days involved very bizarre dreams. Since my memories are a bit chaotic yet connected, I\u0026rsquo;ll put them together. I was living in \u0026ldquo;reality\u0026rdquo; but felt the logic was off, so I thought it might be a dream. But trying to wake up, I was trapped in the dream. However, that dream wasn\u0026rsquo;t right, and I knew I was in a dream, but I wanted to wake up, so I searched for a way out. I\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten the process a bit, but I found a way to leave based on a logical flaw in the dialogue of the dream characters. Then I \u0026ldquo;woke up,\u0026rdquo; which was actually still another layer of dream. Here, I again felt something was logically wrong and \u0026ldquo;woke up.\u0026rdquo; Yes, it was another layer of dream, but this dream only contained my room and myself. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a logical flaw, so I desperately tried to open my eyes, like trying to pull off your real-world helmet in SAO. I tried to open my real eyes. Then I \u0026ldquo;woke up,\u0026rdquo; yes, it was still another layer of dream, but this dream felt very real. Yet, I instantly spotted something wrong again. I was angry, angry that the dream was playing tricks on me. I desperately tried to open my eyes again, opening my real eyes as if they would tear. This time, I truly woke up.\nI really don\u0026rsquo;t remember the specific details, but that\u0026rsquo;s roughly the process. The dream wanted to trap me, give me a beautiful illusion, make me sink into it, but I felt I should break it. I was defending my rights; this might be a manifestation of that process.\nThere were other bizarre dreams, but as I wrote above, I don\u0026rsquo;t really want to recall them. Each dream almost always contained struggle and pain. Even recalling them now brings back that vulnerable state of mind. So, let\u0026rsquo;s leave it at that.\nFrom October to December, I met wonderful friends and gradually emerged from this shadow. I am truly grateful to everyone who helped me. Just like the lyrics of 《僕が死のうと思ったのは》:\n僕が死のうと思ったのは　あなたが綺麗に笑うから 死ぬことばかり考えてしまうのは　きっと生きる事に真面目すぎるから 僕が死のうと思ったのは　まだあなたに出会ってなかったから あなたのような人が生まれた　世界を少し好きになったよ あなたのような人が生きてる　世界に少し期待するよ\nThe reason I thought I was going to die was because you smiled so beautifully. The reason I keep thinking about dying is probably because I\u0026rsquo;m too serious about living. The reason I thought I was going to die was because I hadn\u0026rsquo;t met you yet. I\u0026rsquo;ve grown to like the world a little, a world where someone like you was born. I have a little hope for a world where someone like you lives.\nRegardless of what comes next, for now, you are the light in my darkness.\nCurrent Status Unlike what I said at the end of 2024, that might have just been a disguise, a facade of a normal person based on \u0026ldquo;this is logical.\u0026rdquo; But now, it seems I can try to break free from the constraints of that logic and truly have my eyes light up, radiating energy from within, rather than faking a smile based on logic.\nOf course, I haven\u0026rsquo;t changed much. I still follow rules, but this time, they\u0026rsquo;re more flexible, or rather, the core is the definition of love: \u0026ldquo;First, self-love, and then the overflowing energy nourishes others.\u0026rdquo; This also aligns with the feeling I got from a Warma video, which said, \u0026ldquo;Your matters, your feelings are always the top priority.\u0026rdquo;\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re also feeling lost and have read this far, please try to love yourself first. Only then will you have the energy to love the world.\nFinally Honestly, I don\u0026rsquo;t know what to write in this article. If I lean towards personal growth, it feels too dark, and the middle part I wrote made me too scared. If I lean towards joy, my real experiences won\u0026rsquo;t allow me to cover up that unforgettable journey.\nSo be it. Life isn\u0026rsquo;t always perfect; a 60-point answer sheet is already passing. If you\u0026rsquo;ve truly read through this, I hope you won\u0026rsquo;t be troubled by negative emotions (though I tried my best to restrain myself), because just as I must defend my right to life and health, self-love and your own happiness are always the top priority.\n","date":"2025-12-31T16:16:44+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/263/","title":"2025 Annual Review"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Running a bash script on Windows is a pain.

Here is the command template:\n1 docker run --rm -it -v \u0026#34;$(pwd)\u0026#34;:/data -w /data alpine sh The parameters are as follows:\nParameter Meaning \u0026ndash;rm Remove the container after exiting -it Combination of interactive and tty; allows interaction and output -v Path mapping; maps the current directory to /data in the container -w Sets the working directory, so you start inside /data sh The command to run (in this case, the shell) If you only want to run a single command without staying in an interactive shell, just append the command at the end:\n1 docker run --rm -v \u0026#34;$(pwd)\u0026#34;:/data -w /data alpine ls -la Windows The commands differ between PowerShell and CMD due to how they handle environment variables. Here is how to open an interactive Alpine shell:\nPowerShell 1 docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}:/data -w /data alpine sh CMD 1 docker run --rm -it -v %cd%:/data -w /data alpine sh Linux On Linux, containers run as root by default. To prevent files generated inside the container from being owned by root on your host, it\u0026rsquo;s best to map your current user\u0026rsquo;s UID and GID:\n1 docker run --rm -it -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v \u0026#34;$(pwd)\u0026#34;:/data -w /data alpine sh MacOS No special permission handling is usually required. Use the same variables as Linux:\n1 docker run --rm -it -v \u0026#34;$(pwd)\u0026#34;:/data -w /data alpine sh Notes - Alpine Since Alpine is extremely minimal, you might need to install common utilities yourself. Use the apk add command to install what you need.\n","date":"2025-12-26T18:43:04+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/262/","title":"Building Temporary Interactive Linux Environments with Docker"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by Gemini-2.5-pro Introduction Back in 2022, when I was first messing with Linux(Simplify Chinese) , I had this idea that you don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily have to pay for a special OS just to build a NAS.\nFast forward to today. While tinkering with my server, the mount speeds on my cloud drives have been just\u0026hellip; disappointing. On impulse, I ordered an N5095 motherboard. I realized the 4GB RAM stick I have lying around is a bit low, but I really didn\u0026rsquo;t want to spend any more money.\nAnd so, my tinkering journey began again.\nTech Choices First up, the OS. For this low-spec setup, the lightest choice is obvious: Alpine Linux.\nNext, how to install it. To stay compatible with WEPE , I used Ventoy as the main bootloader to install the system.\nServices are all deployed using Docker to keep the host system clean and make everything reproducible.\nServices I\u0026rsquo;m using:\nMedia: Emby Comics: Komga Music: Navidrome Audio Drama/Voice: Kikoeru Sharing: Samba Dashboard: Heimdall Services I considered but skipped:\nMedia: Jellyfin Comics/Novels: Kavita Cloud Mount: CloudDrive File Structure My usual style for service locations: each service gets its own folder under /home.\nAll HDDs are mounted under /mnt, which is pretty standard.\nI use mount \u0026ndash;bind to \u0026ldquo;bind\u0026rdquo; the actual files on the HDDs to the locations where the services expect them.\nSystem Installation Download Alpine Linux from the official site , put it on a Ventoy USB drive. Set the motherboard BIOS to boot from USB, select Alpine Linux from the Ventoy menu, and boot.\nAfter it finishes loading, log in as root (no password needed). Once logged in, run the install command:\n1 setup-alpine Just follow the prompts to complete the installation.\nOfficial docs: setup-alpine - Alpine Linux Public Key Login Edit the SSH config. First, create the .ssh folder.\n1 mkdir .ssh Go into the folder:\n1 cd .ssh Add your public key to authorized_keys.\n1 vi authorized_keys (Your public key is in %USERPROFILE%\\.ssh on Windows)\nEnable public key authentication in the SSH daemon config:\n1 vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config Around line 41, uncomment the line so it says:\n1 PubkeyAuthentication yes Enable Community Repository Open the repositories file:\n1 vi /etc/apk/repositories Remove the comment (#) from the community line:\n1 2 3 #/media/dm-0/apks http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.22/main http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.22/community Install Docker Update packages:\n1 apk update Install Docker:\n1 apk add docker docker-cli-compose Set it to start on boot:\n1 rc-update add docker default Start Docker:\n1 service docker start Check if it\u0026rsquo;s running:\n1 docker ps Add Swap The server image didn\u0026rsquo;t have swap by default, so I added it. (Though I later realized it did add some, so this is optional depending on your needs).\nCreate a swap file:\n1 fallocate -l 8G /swapfile Set permissions to root-only:\n1 chmod 600 /swapfile Format as swap:\n1 mkswap /swapfile Enable the swap:\n1 swapon /swapfile Check if it\u0026rsquo;s active:\n1 free -h Mount Hard Drives Check all block devices:\n1 fdisk -l Install NTFS support:\n1 apk add ntfs-3g Create a mount point folder:\n1 mkdir /mnt/hc550 Mount the drive:\n1 mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdc1 /mnt/hc550 To unmount, you can use the path (recommended):\n1 umount /mnt/hc550 Or the device name:\n1 umount /dev/sdc1 Auto-mount on Boot Get the partition\u0026rsquo;s UUID. This prevents issues if the device name (/dev/sdc1) changes on reboot.\n1 blkid Edit /etc/fstab:\n1 vi /etc/fstab Add this line (using your UUID):\n1 2 # \u0026lt;Device-UUID\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Mount-Point\u0026gt; \u0026lt;File-System\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Options\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dump\u0026gt; \u0026lt;pass\u0026gt; UUID=xxxxxxxx /mnt/hc550 ntfs-3g defaults,uid=1000,gid=1000 0 0 Test if it worked.

It lets me visit a specific domain (like emby.mynas) and have it point to my NAS.\nThe requirement is that your devices use the router as their DNS server. Then, in the router\u0026rsquo;s DHCP/DNS settings, give the NAS a static IP and add the custom domains, pointing them all to the NAS\u0026rsquo;s IP.\nNginx-UI To make the custom domains work, you need a reverse proxy. I use Nginx.\nDocker Compose file:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 version: \u0026#39;3.1\u0026#39; services: nginx-ui: image: uozi/nginx-ui:v2.2.0-patch.1 container_name: nginx_UI volumes: - /home/nginxUI/nginx:/etc/nginx - /home/nginxUI/nginx-ui:/etc/nginx-ui - /home/nginxUI/www:/www environment: - NGINX_UI_IGNORE_DOCKER_SOCKET=true ports: - 80:80 - 443:443 restart: always When a container needs to access another container, its bridge IP is 172.17.0.1.\nSo, if you have a service mapped to port 8888 on the host, the reverse proxy address isn\u0026rsquo;t 127.0.0.1:8888, it\u0026rsquo;s 172.17.0.1:8888.\n(See: 2025 New Server Setup Log#Installing-nginx-ui(Simplify Chinese) for why I set that environment variable).\nConclusion I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve finally achieved what I was talking about back in 2022.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also weird\u0026hellip; in just three years, even though I subjectively feel like I haven\u0026rsquo;t changed at all, when I read my old articles and remember my situation when I wrote them, I can truly feel that my way of thinking has changed, top to bottom.\nTo be honest, back then I was probably thinking of using a specialized system like True NAS. But I never would have imagined that when I finally did it, I would use a \u0026ldquo;from scratch\u0026rdquo; method that my past self wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have even dared to try. Looking back at my old posts, piecing this all together\u0026hellip; I can genuinely feel the \u0026ldquo;value\u0026rdquo; in it.\nThe tinkering never stops, and neither does the passion.\n","date":"2025-11-13T17:57:29+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/261/","title":"Your next NAS is not a NAS"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash Sound Vibes Series Song Title Translation Link 僕が死のうと思ったのは I Thought About Dying https://blog.yexca.net/archives/214 あくあ色ぱれっと Aqua Color Palette https://blog.yexca.net/archives/219 恋の押し売り Love Sales Pitch https://blog.yexca.net/archives/220 17さいのうた The 17-Year-Old\u0026rsquo;s Song https://blog.yexca.net/archives/224 drop Falling in Love https://blog.yexca.net/archives/230 生きるを選んだ私へ To Myself, Who Chose to Live https://blog.yexca.net/archives/239 rainy lady Uncleared Rain Vibes https://blog.yexca.net/archives/249 恋しくなったら手を叩こう If You Miss Love, Clap Your Hands https://blog.yexca.net/archives/250 pris-magic! Prism Magic! This Article Intro I grabbed Shigure Ui\u0026rsquo;s first physical album, \u0026ldquo;Mada Ame wa Yamanai,\u0026rdquo; a while back, but honestly, I mostly just had \u0026ldquo;rainy lady\u0026rdquo; on repeat. Then, last week, I stumbled upon the limited first-edition of her second album, \u0026ldquo;fiction,\u0026rdquo; and snagged it. While checking it out, I went back to \u0026ldquo;Mada Ame wa Yamanai\u0026rdquo; and realized I\u0026rsquo;d totally overlooked this gem of a track!\nInitially, after one listen, this song didn\u0026rsquo;t really click. But a couple of days ago, a melody just kept looping in my head. I figured it was Shigure Ui\u0026rsquo;s voice, but \u0026ldquo;fiction\u0026rdquo; wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite it. I found similar vibes but couldn\u0026rsquo;t pinpoint the exact track. So, I broadened my search, listened to this song, and boom—that familiar feeling hit.\nSpeaking of the song, its rhythm is pretty solid. But that sudden line, \u0026ldquo;Kimi wa watashi no taiyou\u0026rdquo; (You are my sun), instantly lifts your mood, especially when you\u0026rsquo;re feeling a bit down. Yuika\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Okusuri\u0026rdquo; kind of gives a similar vibe too, though it\u0026rsquo;s a tad more upbeat.\nWhen I was translating, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure how to tackle the title. Halfway through, the \u0026lsquo;color\u0026rsquo; theme just clicked. Also, \u0026ldquo;pris\u0026rdquo; made me think of both \u0026ldquo;prison\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;prism.\u0026rdquo; Given the context (and \u0026ldquo;prison magic\u0026rdquo; being a definite no-go), I went with the latter—it feels way cuter.\nFinally, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if Shigure Ui just digs rain, or if it\u0026rsquo;s for thematic consistency, but the whole album feels connected, right? \u0026ldquo;Mada Ame wa Yamanai\u0026rdquo; means \u0026ldquo;The Rain Hasn\u0026rsquo;t Stopped Yet.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;rainy lady\u0026rdquo; refers to herself as a \u0026ldquo;rainy season lady.\u0026rdquo; Then, \u0026ldquo;pris-magic!\u0026rdquo; features the lyric \u0026ldquo;Kimi wa watashi no taiyou\u0026rdquo; (You are my sun), shining on me. It ties together like this: \u0026ldquo;My mood was gloomy like the rain, but your appearance illuminated me, brightening my spirits.\u0026rdquo; (Though \u0026ldquo;fiction,\u0026rdquo; her second album, also has a rainy cover.)\nI actually love rain too. It\u0026rsquo;s awesome white noise, super calming~\nMusic Video Lyrics Light reflecting in puddles\nVibrant scenery\nIf you smile, look\nRain turns to clear skies, and a rainbow appears\n(1, 2, ready—go!)\n(Pitter rainy sky\nPatter shiny smile\nThere might be a rainbow in the sky\nJust like solar ray\nPass through prism\nStaining into seven colors)\nGazing at the faded sky\nEven on slightly gloomy days\nIf I can hear your voice\nIt feels like something new is about to start\n(Rainy sky) Like it\u0026rsquo;s about to rain\n(Rainy sky) Like hydrangeas\nIn my indigo-colored heart\n(Shiny sky) Like light piercing through\n(Shiny sky) Like a sunflower\nMy days are vividly repainted\nPris-magic!

So, let\u0026rsquo;s get to it.\nBut looking back, it\u0026rsquo;s already been three years since my last tinkering . Time really flies, huh?\nManga: Komga First up is Komga for reading manga. While scanning can be a bit sluggish, the overall user experience is decent.\nAfter all these years, Komga has seen many updates. My previous article is no longer reusable. Using docker-compose makes things more portable. Here\u0026rsquo;s the docker-compose.yml:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 version: \u0026#39;3.0\u0026#39; services: komga: image: gotson/komga:1.23.4 container_name: komga volumes: - type: bind source: /home/komga/config target: /config - type: bind source: /home/rclone/data target: /data ports: - 25600:25600 restart: unless-stopped Also, having a dedicated iOS app Komic is super convenient.\nrclone Mounts Google Drive Similar to Microsoft OneDrive , you first need to authenticate in a browser on a Windows machine to get a token.\nThe process is to download rclone, then run the command:\n1 rclone config After naming, select Google Drive (22), grant Full access all files, excluding Application Data Folder permission, then hit enter for the browser login to pop up. Once done, exit.\nInitially, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t entirely sure, so I applied for a software ID and Secret. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be used here, but I\u0026rsquo;ll keep a record in case it\u0026rsquo;s useful later.\nApplying for Google API ID and Secret Open the Google API Services website: https://console.developers.google.com/ Select Enable APIs and services, search for and enable Google Drive API.\nIn the Manage section of Google Drive API, Create credentials.\nFor API type, choose User data, which includes OAuth as described.\nIn OAuth Client ID, select Web application as the type. You can enter rclone for the name. After completion, a Client ID will appear.\nThen complete the creation. In Credentials, select the rclone app you just created and copy the Client secrets.\nNext, copy the config file to the server. The local directory is:\n1 C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Roaming\\rclone On the server, download fuse. My server is CentOS7, so I downloaded these:\n1 sudo yum install -y fuse fuse3 fuse-libs Newer systems can just download fuse3. Then mount it with Docker:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 sudo docker run --rm \\ --volume /home/opc/rclone/config:/config/rclone \\ --volume /home/opc/rclone/data:/data:shared \\ --volume /etc/passwd:/etc/passwd:ro --volume /etc/group:/etc/group:ro \\ --device /dev/fuse --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --security-opt apparmor:unconfined \\ rclone/rclone \\ mount GoogleDrive:/ /data \\ --no-checksum \\ --use-server-modtime \\ --no-gzip-encoding \\ --no-update-modtime \\ --no-seek \\ --modify-window 2m \\ --allow-other \\ --allow-non-empty \\ --dir-cache-time 30m \\ --cache-read-retries 15 \\ --cache-db-purge \\ --timeout 30m \\ --vfs-cache-mode full \\ --vfs-read-chunk-size 2M \\ --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 5M \\ --vfs-cache-max-age 30m \\ --attr-timeout 20s \\ --poll-interval 9m \\ --vfs-cache-poll-interval 10m\u0026amp; The long list of configurations afterwards refers to Komga\u0026rsquo;s official documentation . Their specific meanings are:\nParameter Purpose Explanation --no-checksum Skip checksums Reduces API calls and speeds up directory loading. Suitable for large files like videos. --use-server-modtime Use server\u0026rsquo;s file modification time Prevents duplicate uploads/syncs due to local vs. remote time differences. --no-gzip-encoding Disable GZIP encoding Some cloud services (like Drive) perform poorly with compressed responses; this reduces CPU usage. --no-update-modtime Do not update file modification time Prevents Drive from triggering version updates due to time changes for read-only purposes. --no-seek Disable random seeking Reduces support for video seeking, but improves stability for sequential reads. Suitable for continuous playback. --modify-window 2m File modification time error tolerance window Prevents misidentification due to local/remote time differences. --allow-other Allow other system users to access mounted content Requires explicit permission in /etc/fuse.conf. --allow-non-empty Mount non-empty directories Allows mounting even if the mount point is not empty. --dir-cache-time 30m Directory cache time Reduces frequent requests to cloud API, default is moderate. --cache-read-retries 15 Number of retries on cache read failure Improves stability. --cache-db-purge Purge cache database on each startup Prevents errors from corrupted old caches. Suitable for environments where mounts are frequently stopped/started. --timeout 30m Single transfer timeout limit Prevents disconnections when reading long videos or large files. --vfs-cache-mode full Full VFS cache mode Both reads and writes go through local cache. Most balanced and secure performance. --vfs-read-chunk-size 2M Chunk size for each download Smaller saves bandwidth but is more frequent. This config is suitable for low-bandwidth environments. --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 5M Maximum chunk size limit Limits growth to prevent timeouts from excessively large requests. --vfs-cache-max-age 30m Maximum cache file age Relatively short duration, good for saving space. --attr-timeout 20s File attribute cache time Prevents frequent stat() calls; 20s is a compromise. --poll-interval 9m Cloud change polling interval Checks for changes every 9 minutes, reducing Google API load. --vfs-cache-poll-interval 10m Local cache cleanup interval Cleans up expired cache every 10 minutes. Using Alpine Linux Due to high resource usage, I thought of using the extremely lightweight Alpine Linux.\nDocker Installation First, update packages:\n1 doas apk update Install Docker:\n1 doas apk add docker docker-cli-compose Configure startup on boot:\n1 rc-update add docker default Start Docker. This might take a moment:\n1 doas service docker start Add yourself to the Docker user group:\n1 doas addgroup ${USER} docker Reference articles:\nhttps://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Docker Swap Creation First, add swap space:\n1 doas fallocate -l 8G /swapfile Set permissions for root access only:\n1 doas chmod 600 /swapfile Format swap:\n1 doas mkswap /swapfile Enable swap:\n1 doas swapon /swapfile Then you can check if it\u0026rsquo;s active:\n1 free -h rclone Configuration Being extremely lightweight, it requires some additional configuration.\nFirst, install fuse:\n1 doas apk add fuse Load fuse module:\n1 doas modprobe fuse Then you need to change the root directory to a shared type:\n1 doas mount --make-rshared / After that, it\u0026rsquo;s similar to CentOS7.\nReference articles:\nHow to Install Rclone on Alpine Linux Latest Alpine Linux Wiki Rclone Kikoeru I hit a few dead ends at first and ultimately failed, so I\u0026rsquo;ll just log it here.\nAn Afternoon of Failure TT I followed forks of the classic kikoeru project to find the latest commit. While I did find XunJiJiang/kikoeru-express , I spent an entire afternoon trying to build the image, from Node.js 12 all the way to 16. I encountered various errors, tried different mirror sources, etc. Then I tried deploying it standalone, which also failed. Even attempting to build it without Docker failed. In the end, I really gave up and decided to stick with the classic 0.6.2.\nUgh, seriously. It recommended Node.js versions 12-14, but during actual build, at some step, it hinted at features from Node.js 16+. If I directly used 14+, npm i would error out. So I had to use version 13 to install dependencies first, then copy them over and build with version 16. Who knew this would take an entire afternoon? Honestly though, it did teach me to skillfully switch Node.js versions, haha.\nI opened an iOS app I had downloaded previously, tried connecting, and it showed an error. Checking the update log, it said to use version 0.6.14 or higher. I was shocked! Then I quickly searched and found Number178/kikoeru-express , which I had already starred 😂.\nNow using the updated Number178/kikoeru-express . The author also developed an iOS app, which is super convenient.\nConfiguration:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 version: \u0026#39;3.0\u0026#39; services: kikoeru: ports: - \u0026#39;8011:8888\u0026#39; container_name: kikoeru volumes: - type: bind source: /home/rclone/data/asmr target: /usr/src/kikoeru/VoiceWork - /home/kikoeru/sqlite:/usr/src/kikoeru/sqlite - /home/kikoeru/covers:/usr/src/kikoeru/covers - /home/kikoeru/config:/usr/src/kikoeru/config image: \u0026#39;number17/kikoeru:v0.6.14-20250914\u0026#39; restart: always Also, the tag language cannot be switched; it defaults to Simplified Chinese.

After checking out some smaller server providers, I saw Alibaba Cloud offers discounts if you\u0026rsquo;ve been bill-free for 12 months. Since I was already looking at big names, Oracle popped into my head.\nFigured I\u0026rsquo;d give it a shot. Used all my real info, and it actually got approved directly. Sweet!\nBut then it hit me: the last time I tinkered with a server was back in 2023. Two years zipped by just like that. Time flies, huh?\nOracle Linux When creating the image, I found my preferred Debian wasn\u0026rsquo;t an option, so I decided to try Oracle Linux. Turns out, this thing comes with MySQL pre-installed (I\u0026rsquo;m a bit of a host minimalist with Docker, lol). Not only that, it takes up a ton of resources. For a free 1C1G instance, it just lagged out. Had to switch images.\nOracle Linux Usage Log First, an upgrade. Seeing the dnf command actually reminded me of my Fedora days.\n1 sudo dnf update -y Then I spotted MySQL in the upgrade list. Server was bogged down, so I planned to uninstall it. First, check MySQL service status.\n1 sudo systemctl status mysqld Service is running, so stop it first.\n1 sudo systemctl stop mysqld Disable autostart on boot.\n1 sudo systemctl disable mysqld Uninstall.\n1 sudo dnf remove mysql`server Even after that, software upgrades were still slow. For Docker installation, refer to: https://oracle-base.com/articles/linux/docker-install-docker-on-oracle-linux-ol8 CentOS7 Software Update First, change the repos. Oracle\u0026rsquo;s CentOS7 actually had a broken software list. Running sudo yum update threw an error:\n1 2 Could not retrieve mirrorlist http://mirrorlist.centos.org/?release=7\u0026amp;arch=x86_64\u0026amp;repo=os\u0026amp;infra=stock error was 14: curl#6 - \u0026#34;Could not resolve host: mirrorlist.centos.org; Unknown error\u0026#34; Update the software list.\n1 2 3 sed -i \u0026#39;s/mirror\\.centos\\.org/vault.centos.org/g\u0026#39; /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-*.repo sed -i \u0026#39;s/^#.*baseurl=http/baseurl=http/g\u0026#39; /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-*.repo sed -i \u0026#39;s/^mirrorlist=http/#mirrorlist=http/g\u0026#39; /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-*.repo Then, update the software.\n1 sudo yum update Reference: mirrorlist.centos.org no longer resolve? Install Docker Install tools.\n1 sudo yum install -y yum-utils Configure official repo.\n1 sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo Install.\n1 sudo yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli docker-compose containerd.io Start.\n1 sudo systemctl start docker Set to autostart on boot.\n1 sudo systemctl enable docker Reference: Install Docker on CentOS7 (refer to official docs) Server Port Management Open common ports 80 and 443. First, check firewall status.\n1 sudo systemctl status firewalld Output Active: active (running) means it\u0026rsquo;s running. Check currently open ports (permanently open).\n1 sudo firewalld-cmd --list-all --permanent Add open port.\n1 sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8080/tcp --permanent Reload to take effect.\n1 sudo firewall-cmd --reload To remove a rule:\n1 sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --remove-port=8080/tcp --permanent Security Group Port Whitelisting Server-side port configuration handles system access, but you also need to whitelist inbound ports in the security group.\nNavigate to Instances - Networking - Subnet to manage the instance\u0026rsquo;s Subnet.\nManage specific security group lists under its Security tab.\nAdd Ingress Rules under its Security rules.\nFor Source Type, use CIDR. Enter 0.0.0.0/0 for Source CIDR. Use TCP for IP Protocol. Enter 80, 443 for Destination Port Range. Description is optional, enter HTTP/S.\nThen just \u0026lsquo;Add Ingress Rules\u0026rsquo;.\nInstall Nginx-UI While my previous article, Server Deployment Log with Docker , covered its specific use, new features have emerged with updates.\nTo allow other containers to control Nginx and for easier updates, new directories need to be mapped. So the docker-compose.yml now looks like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 version: \u0026#39;3.1\u0026#39; services: nginx-ui: restart: always image: uozi/nginx-ui:latest container_name: nginx_UI volumes: - /root/nginx/nginx:/etc/nginx - /root/nginx/nginx-ui:/etc/nginx-ui - /root/nginx/www:/www - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ports: - 80:80 - 443:443 The reason for mapping /var/run/docker.sock, as explained by Nginx-UI:\nNginx UI\u0026rsquo;s official image uses /var/run/docker.sock to communicate with the host Docker Engine via the Docker Client API. This feature is used to control Nginx in another container and to perform container replacement rather than binary replacement during Nginx UI\u0026rsquo;s OTA upgrade, ensuring container dependencies are also upgraded. If you don\u0026rsquo;t need this feature, add the environment variable NGINX_UI_IGNORE_DOCKER_SOCKET=true to the container.\nOther Services Looks like everything else I use can just continue as is. This migration felt super fast; most of the time was spent on server configuration itself.\n","date":"2025-10-03T10:22:25+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/257/","title":"2025 New Server Deployment Log"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash Intro Got some Record Tree JSON files from a senior dev. So I quickly coded up this thing to make life easier and jot down what I always forget. (Hey, fitting that this is article #256!)\nI even used it in PixivDownloader before, but completely blanked on it.\nReading JSON Files After reading, the returned value changes based on the JSON file structure. It\u0026rsquo;ll be either a Python list or a dictionary.\n1 2 3 4 import json with open(FILE_PATH, \u0026#34;r\u0026#34;, encoding=\u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34;) as f: jsonParse = json.load(f) Now you can mess with the jsonParse variable.\nLists If your JSON file looks like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 [ { \u0026#34;a\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;b\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;c\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;d\u0026#34; } ] Then, jsonParse will be an outer list, with each item inside being a dictionary.\nDictionaries If your JSON file looks like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 { \u0026#34;a\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;c\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;d\u0026#34; } } Then, jsonParse will be a two-level nested dictionary.\nOperations Once you know the type, you just treat it like any Python dictionary or list. For example, given this file:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 [ { \u0026#34;a\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;b\u0026#34;: 2 }, { \u0026#34;c\u0026#34;: 3, \u0026#34;d\u0026#34;: 4 } ] Code to print 1:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 import json with open(FILE_PATH, \u0026#34;r\u0026#34;, encoding=\u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34;) as f: s = json.load(f) print(s[0][\u0026#34;a\u0026#34;]) # Or print(s[0].get(\u0026#34;a\u0026#34;)) Code to change 4 to 100:\n1 2 3 4 5 import json with open(FILE_PATH, \u0026#34;r\u0026#34;, encoding=\u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34;) as f: s = json.load(f) s[1][\u0026#34;d\u0026#34;] = 100 Add an item to make the file look like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 [ { \u0026#34;a\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;b\u0026#34;: 2 }, { \u0026#34;c\u0026#34;: 3, \u0026#34;d\u0026#34;: 4 }, { \u0026#34;e\u0026#34;: 5 } ] Basically, just append a dictionary to the list. Here\u0026rsquo;s the code:\n1 2 3 4 5 import json with open(FILE_PATH, \u0026#34;r\u0026#34;, encoding=\u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34;) as f: s = json.load(f) s.append({\u0026#34;e\u0026#34;: 5}) Iteration For lists, use list iteration:\n1 2 for i in s: print(i) For dictionaries, use dictionary iteration:\n1 2 3 4 5 for key, value in s.items(): print(key, value) for key in s: print(key) Saving Use json.dump:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 with open(FILE_PATH, \u0026#34;r\u0026#34;, encoding=\u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34;) as f: s = json.load(f) # Make some changes to variable s with open(FILE_PATH, \u0026#34;w\u0026#34;, encoding=\u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34;) as f: json.dump(s, f, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2) ensure_ascii=False makes sure non-ASCII chars (like Chinese) are written correctly. indent=2 pretty-prints it with 2-space indents.\n","date":"2025-09-28T10:34:38+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/256/","title":"Python: Handling JSON Files"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by ChatGPT Introduction Scrolling through videos, playing games—these always felt like relaxing activities, the kind that should restore my energy afterward. Yet living like this every day has left me feeling empty and fatigued. This raised a question: in theory, I haven’t been doing anything energy-intensive, so why do I still feel so drained?\nThe Pomodoro Dilemma I remembered when I once suffered from eye strain. To protect my eyes, I started using the Pomodoro technique for studying. At first, my goal was clear: during breaks I would gaze into the distance or simply lie down and rest. It worked really well.\nBut as time went on, I wanted my breaks to feel more “entertaining.” I began using longer breaks to watch videos, listen to music, or play games. Gradually, my efficiency plummeted. I started feeling that using a timer was burdensome. Studying became tiring (sometimes I was deeply focused, but the timer forced me to stop), and even playing felt stressful. With only 20 minutes of playtime, I couldn’t relax at all—I just felt anxious.\nEntertainment: Another Form of Focus Thinking again, maybe entertainment isn’t actually relaxation. Entertainment, like studying, requires focus and mental energy. The whole idea of the Pomodoro technique is to manage periods of focus, then allow time for rest. That “rest” is meant to relax both mind and body, to recover from concentrated effort.\nWhen I deliberately emptied my mind and went for a walk, strolled in a park, or browsed a bookstore, I felt far more relaxed than watching videos or gaming. These activities consumed some physical energy, but compared to entertainment or study, they demanded much less mental energy.\nRedefining Entertainment and Relaxation From this, I realized my old definition of entertainment was flawed. Entertainment isn’t a way to restore myself after study—it’s another activity that requires mental effort. When I’m already low on mental energy, doing more of these things only drains me further. At that point, entertainment loses its meaning—like a phone running out of battery while you keep high-power apps running.\nRelaxation, on the other hand, should be redefined. It’s about opening up mind and body, drifting freely. When mental energy is lacking, doing something low in both mental and physical demand works better—tidying up, wandering aimlessly, doing things without purpose or intention.\nThe Blurred Line Between Study and Entertainment So if both study and entertainment require focus, what makes them different?\nI think it depends on interest. No matter how much concentration an activity needs, if you’re genuinely interested, it feels like entertainment; if not, it feels like study.\nFor example, with a game: if driven by interest, you just play for fun; if approached as “study,” it becomes about goals and achievements.\nOr with a movie franchise: with interest, you sit back and enjoy the spectacle; approached as study, you dissect details, explore lore, and analyze continuity.\nThe boundary is blurry. In most cases, it comes down to personal perception.\nRelaxation: True Recharge for Mental Energy Any activity with a specific goal still consumes mental focus—even some things we think of as relaxing, like grocery shopping, going to a bookstore, or even visiting a park.\nOnce there’s a purpose attached, it isn’t true relaxation, because the mind isn’t really at rest. The energy drained isn’t restored.\nRelaxation, then, can be seen as using light physical activity to compensate for mental fatigue. And if even the body feels too weak, then the best choice is simply to lie down.\nPerhaps real rest is not about finding an easy activity to do, but about allowing yourself to do nothing at all.\nConclusion Study helps us grow. Entertainment excites us. But true relaxation restores us.\nLife shouldn’t be only about chasing and stimulation. Maybe what we really need is not more entertainment, but the ability to pause.\n","date":"2025-08-22T22:17:38+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/253/","title":"Relaxation ≠ Entertainment: Rethinking Mental Energy"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by ChatGPT Introduction: The Drifting Sense of Learning In order to improve my English a little, I try to use it for things that aren’t too important, like games or daily apps. But every time I use it, I end up with a strange feeling of not having grasped anything—almost like drifting, as if I never truly experienced it at all.\nAfter thinking about it more deeply, I realized this might be the gap between translation and immersion. When Chinese, my native language, gets involved, the experience feels anchored and connected. But in a completely non-native environment, that connection disappears. Since I usually think in my mother tongue, I naturally overlook the thought process in a foreign language.\nAnalogy: The Controlled Sense of Execution From my actual experience, when I’m in a game that’s fully in English, I often feel like I don’t understand anything—even the simplest words. But if I play with friends and we communicate in Chinese, suddenly it feels different. It shifts back to a mode of translation, and instantly I feel lighter, moving from chaotic confusion to a small sense of control.\nThis reminds me of my life in Tokyo. Even when I speak Japanese in conversations, I often feel nothing inside—as if I’m just following a prewritten script rather than living. That’s even why I’ve grown fond of listening to Chinese songs: only then, while wandering around, do I feel like I’m still alive.\nParadox: Theoretical Optimum vs. Real Retreat But wait—this should actually be the ideal environment for language learning, right? A state fully detached from my native tongue. When I’m completely immersed in an English game, with no interference from Chinese, isn’t that the best possible scenario? After all, it’s similar to the idea of thinking in English.\nYet what I feel is quite the opposite. Facing an unfamiliar word, I instantly get the sense that I can’t do anything, that I know nothing. It triggers a kind of retreat, a withdrawal into doing nothing at all. In the end, I feel like my English hasn’t improved one bit—in fact, I’ve lost even more confidence.\nReflection: The Illusion of a Perfect Singularity Looking back at my learning experiences, I suddenly realized—it often doesn’t feel like learning at all. Instead, I rely on instinct and context. In games or daily life, there’s more than just language: there are actions, guides, and environmental cues. Maybe I’ve only been relying on those signals to decide my next move. That gives me the illusion of understanding the target language, but in truth, the language itself gets ignored. Which means I never really learned it.\nSo how have I been learning (not only languages) all along? It seems I’ve always been waiting for a perfect moment to dive in. Unless everything feels “perfect,” I convince myself that investing effort is meaningless. It’s that sense of: “The collecting never stops, but the learning never begins.”\nThis mindset shows up not only in my feelings, but also in my environment and materials. It’s like running a “breadth-first search” algorithm—at every stage, I want to achieve some kind of optimal state before moving forward. Otherwise, I consider the effort pointless. Even forcing myself to do it feels fruitless.\nLife: The Misalignment of Reason and Emotion This reminds me of life itself. When it comes to bothersome things—whether tasks or objects—our short-term and long-term perspectives can be completely different. In the short term, they trouble us; in the long term, they may not matter at all.\nTake an object, for example. In the long run, it might come in handy. But in the moment, it’s completely useless. Keeping it around for some imagined future utility leaves me stuck in discomfort. And in the end, sometimes it never even gets used.\nThe same misalignment happens with tidying up. Rationally, I know cleaning up will help. Emotionally, I don’t want to. Or I keep waiting for a “perfect moment” to start. The result? Until that imaginary moment comes, every reminder just brings irritation.\nConclusion: There Seems to Be No “Right Answer” So is there really an answer to efficient learning—or to efficient living?\nI think… there probably isn’t. Life is full of rational and emotional decisions. Maybe I plan to improve a certain skill during a certain period, but because the future is unpredictable—and feelings fluctuate—every attempt might turn out better or worse than expected.\nThat doesn’t mean there are no small tricks at all. Since new information can overturn old plans in an instant, maybe we can try constraining ourselves differently: give up one dimension, but compensate with another. Fix a certain time, and let quantity vary. Or fix a minimum quantity, and let time vary.\nExtension: Purpose and Freshness This brings me to another thought. Once something gains purpose, it often becomes harder to sustain emotionally. Even entertainment, like playing games, can turn heavy. If I play with the purpose of relieving stress, I can’t help but keep asking: “Am I actually relaxing?” That very awareness becomes a new pressure. Instead of relief, I might just get more exhausted—something like digital burnout.\nThat’s why people suggest: “It’s good to have more hobbies.” I think that makes sense. With different ways of relieving stress (as long as they’re genuinely interesting), you avoid relying too heavily on just one outlet.\nBut maybe the essence is simpler: it’s the sense of novelty. New things bring new energy.\nEpilogue: An “Uncontrollable” Future So what has this article really said? Honestly, I don’t know. Maybe it’s just the product of my confusion.\nBut perhaps that itself is the point—that accepting life’s uncontrollability is the truest way forward. I try to use reason to structure everything, but… no framework of reason can ever explain it all.\nJust like in “state-behavior theory,” you can only know the outcome with 100% certainty if you have all the variables. But how could we ever gather all the variables of life?\nMaybe the impossibility of grasping them is itself one of life’s variables.\n","date":"2025-08-18T18:27:12+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/252/","title":"Adrift in Learning, Misaligned in Life"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by ChatGPT Introduction A few days ago (2025-08-13), I had a dream. In it, the second film of a certain series was titled Phantom Dream, and my name appeared in the credits—though I didn’t know if I was the director or the screenwriter. The title itself wasn’t even original; it was just picked out from two short phrases used by the production studio, just like the first film. But the two films had no connection at all.\nIn the dream, I only saw the movie from the middle. There appeared images of binary-star entanglement, triple-star entanglement, a “second universe,” and then something like a singularity. That singularity triggered a big bang, the universe rebooted, life emerged, and a sprout broke through the soil. Then I woke up.\nAlthough in the dream it was said that this film was somehow related to The Three-Body Problem, from the part I saw, it didn’t feel connected at all. At the test screening I even felt like I might be recognized, and the promotion was boldly carried under the name of The Three-Body Problem. But I don’t think that really matters, so I’ll just skip over it.\nAnalysis I kept thinking about this dream. Binary- and triple-star entanglements are inherently unstable structures, representing contradiction and tension. The singularity and big bang symbolize the point where contradictions become irreconcilable, leading to an explosive conflict. After that, life appears, the sprout pushes through the soil—this is rebirth.\nSo, this whole sequence points to instability, or entanglement that cannot hold. Energy accumulates until it collapses into a singularity, then explodes, and new life begins.\nThoughts The film bore my name, but I didn’t know its contents. And while watching it in the dream, I even felt like I was the main character. To me, it seemed almost like a story about my own life—or about something I went through: various elements tangled together, unstable, and finally pushed by me into an explosion that led to both destruction and rebirth.\nAt the part with the triple-star entanglement, someone—maybe the audience, maybe the scrolling comments—said it was “the hardest frame.” Perhaps that meant the situation was already unstable, yet I still had to trigger it myself. It was a hard decision to make.\nRebirth At first, I thought the dream was hopeful, suggesting that something halfway through my life might turn around. But after more reflection, I realized nothing in my current life seems to be at such a turning point.\nLooking again, starting from the film’s title Phantom Dream, it seems to mean my recent experiences themselves were a “phantom dream.” Maybe I was the one who pierced it, bringing about a kind of rebirth.\nOr perhaps it means I inevitably escalate contradictions until they explode, but in the end, that destruction becomes my transformation.\nRealization I once built myself a rational decision-making system. My life felt like a rehearsal of choices—running through simulations of what might be “better.” During that time, I wasn’t really living; I was mechanically optimizing.\nAs the number of choices grew, I always viewed things from the widest possible range of possibilities. It looked reasonable, but as I realized, my life lost its own flavor. Just like Phantom Dream: I was the director, I was the protagonist, but I didn’t know the plot. I was just watching that movie—watching my life.\nLater, I began prioritizing my feelings, trying to consider what I actually liked. At first it felt refreshing. But gradually, I sank deeper into my emotions, and in doing so, lost my broad rational judgment. That, too, was Phantom Dream—a complete immersion in sentiment. Beautiful, maybe, but in the end just a dream.\nSo, against the unstable backdrop of lost rationality, I sought out a singularity—an end point—to force a psychological transformation and start anew.\nReflection I think this was my soul’s metamorphosis after living through almost purely rational and purely emotional modes. I realized extreme approaches don’t work. Life is inherently tangled; no single measure can define it.\nToo much rationality erases the small details of feeling, while too much emotion turns life chaotic. The balance is hard to hold. But isn’t life itself a kind of “phantom dream”? We are both the director and the protagonist—yet we never know the next scene.\nPostscript This essay itself is pretty chaotic. But isn’t that proof I’m analyzing while still inside the chaos, searching for my own singularity? And this time, the singularity is simply writing it down and publishing it. In that act, my blog breaks its silence and starts anew. 😂\n","date":"2025-08-17T01:13:32+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/251/","title":"Phantom Dream"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash Sound Vibes Series Song Title Translation Link 僕が死のうと思ったのは I Thought About Dying https://blog.yexca.net/archives/214 あくあ色ぱれっと Aqua-Colored Palette https://blog.yexca.net/archives/219 恋の押し売り Love Sales Pitch https://blog.yexca.net/archives/220 17さいのうた Song of 17 https://blog.yexca.net/archives/224 drop Falling in Love https://blog.yexca.net/archives/230 生きるを選んだ私へ To Myself Who Chose to Live https://blog.yexca.net/archives/239 rainy lady Rainy Lady https://blog.yexca.net/archives/249 恋しくなったら手を叩こう When You Miss Someone, Clap Your Hands This Article pris-magic!

Pris-magic! https://blog.yexca.net/archives/260 Introduction My thoughts on this song\u0026hellip; well, I already mentioned how I found it in a previous post: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/243/ . When I first heard it, especially that intro, it felt like it perfectly synced with my headspace at the time.\nOf course, I’m talking about those first few lines. With my Japanese level back then, I didn\u0026rsquo;t really grasp the rest (honestly, even the translation is a bit fuzzy to me). The overall vibe is one of powerlessness—that \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m so small\u0026rdquo; feeling. It\u0026rsquo;s like there are so many amazing people in the world, all shining bright, leaving me both envious and feeling a little pathetic.\nMaybe it\u0026rsquo;s because I usually listen to EDM (instrumental tracks), so I tend to project my own emotions onto songs now. Whenever I see a cute girl or meet someone really impressive in real life, the intro of this song often pops into my head. It’s a complex mix of admiration, longing, and a bit of regret for my own limitations.\nLooking closer at the lyrics later—putting aside the \u0026ldquo;romance\u0026rdquo; element—you can sense a certain uncertainty about the future. Though you can\u0026rsquo;t ignore the romance entirely, I’m not even sure what I’m writing here\u0026hellip; it’s just that feeling of \u0026ldquo;wanting to do what you love but being afraid to speak up.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s probably not just about dating.\n2025.05.26 Sang this song. Couldn\u0026rsquo;t keep up after the intro, didn\u0026rsquo;t know the melody well. Just for fun; I\u0026rsquo;ll stick to listening from now on.\nHowever, curiosity led me to sing \u0026ldquo;Shukusei!! Loli-Kami Requiem☆\u0026rdquo; after seeing the original video.

But it ended up saving me a ton of time without a single bug, and the more I used it, the smoother it felt.\nSlowly, it sparked that old thought: \u0026ldquo;Why not just use SQLite?\u0026rdquo; Seriously, spinning up a MySQL instance every time is a real pain. So, this version came to be, finally freeing me from firing up a database service every time. (And it\u0026rsquo;s finally actually usable by humans, too.)\nUsage Project Link: https://github.com/yexca/PixivDownloader-SQLite The GUI is similar to the previous generation; check out https://blog.yexca.net/archives/211/ for details.\nConfiguration Before use, you need to configure:\nrefresh token (for Pixiv login authentication, refer to: Pixiv OAuth Flow ) Download path (default D:\\Downloads) Download Instructions After setup, simply input:\nArtist ID, or Artwork ID (if both are provided, only the Artist ID will be used) Click \u0026lsquo;Download\u0026rsquo; to fetch all works and log them to the database. For artists without existing records, all works will be downloaded. For artists with records, only un-downloaded works will be fetched.\nError Handling Regarding program errors, only basic crawling error handling is implemented. If an error dialog pops up, it might be due to:\nrefresh token not configured or expired Artist account does not exist Artwork does not exist I haven\u0026rsquo;t provided specific error messages; if an error occurs, please check these three points.\nFor other errors (like the application crashing), please send me the latest file from program_root/logs/app_*-*-*.log and describe the issue.\nContact: PixivDownloader#yexca.net (replace @)\nNew Feature: From MySQL to SQLite The biggest change is no longer needing your own MySQL setup; it now uses lightweight SQLite.\nI then removed unnecessary database configs and consolidated settings with the Pixiv auth token.\nAdded an icon (just had ChatGPT draw one for fun), tweaked some UI styles – nothing major.\nThe code got some initial architectural structuring, though it ended up messy again by the end. (But who knows, maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll revisit it someday?)\nMigrating from Old MySQL Database While I doubt anyone used the previous version, I still need to explain this. Due to database structure differences, the best way to migrate is to query, export, and directly import. Here\u0026rsquo;s the query:\n1 2 3 SELECT ID, name, downloadedDate, lastDownloadID, url FROM pic WHERE platform = \u0026#39;pixiv\u0026#39;; Export the results in SQL INSERT format (I used Dataflare, which supports this).\nThen, create a Python file and put in the following content:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 import sqlite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(\u0026#34;pixiv.db\u0026#34;) cursor = conn.cursor() cursor.execute(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39; Create Table If Not Exists pic ( ID TEXT PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, downloadedDate TEXT, lastDownloadID TEXT, url TEXT ) \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39;) conn.commit() cursor.execute(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; INSERT INTO `pic` (`ID`, `name`, `downloadedDate`, `lastDownloadID`, `url`) VALUES (\u0026#39;123\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;name1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;2024-06-08 00:00:00\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;1234\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;https://www.pixiv.net/users/123\u0026#39;), (\u0026#39;234\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;name2\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;2025-02-12 00:05:36\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;2345\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;https://www.pixiv.net/users/234\u0026#39;), (\u0026#39;345\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;name3\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;2025-01-11 17:26:17\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;3456\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;https://www.pixiv.net/users/345\u0026#39;); \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; ) conn.commit() cursor.execute(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; Select * from pic \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; ) rows = cursor.fetchall() for row in rows: print(row) conn.close() Replace the content within cursor.execute with your database backup. I\u0026rsquo;ve left three example records here.\nThen, place the generated pixiv.db file into program_root/resources.\nSome Dev Thoughts: From \u0026lsquo;Messy Code\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;Understanding the Chaos\u0026rsquo; Honestly, when I started this dev cycle, I really wanted to refactor the previous messy code. But as I worked on it, I realized exactly why it got so messy in the first place 😂\nIf anything, this refactor ended up even messier. Halfway through, I just thought, \u0026ldquo;Forget refactoring, I\u0026rsquo;ll just copy-paste it.\u0026rdquo; That led to the current mix of camelCase and snake_case, and honestly, I\u0026rsquo;m too tired to touch it anymore, sigh.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s pretty much a runnable, half-finished product, but hey, if it works, it works, right?~\n","date":"2025-05-18T16:20:33+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/248/","title":"Pixiv Downloader Refactor: From Haphazard Code to Understanding the Chaos"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash Introduction Lately, while thinking about what to do or learn next, the word \u0026ldquo;DevOps\u0026rdquo; kept popping up. Initially, I did a quick search and found that I was familiar with most of the listed tech stack. I thought it was just about knowing more tools, similar to \u0026ldquo;full-stack\u0026rdquo; (which, in a way, it is). But I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too interested, so I put it aside (honestly, I just lacked development passion).\nUntil recently, after almost four months of taking it easy, I felt the need to get back into it. That\u0026rsquo;s when \u0026ldquo;DevOps\u0026rdquo; came to mind again. After looking into it further, what can I say\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s like extreme consolidation, right? We separated frontend and backend but kept the teams. Now it\u0026rsquo;s like separating dev and ops, but the same person does both.\nHowever, seeing GitHub Actions for automation reminded me of when my Jekyll blog could auto-deploy. But since I migrated from another blog system and kept my subfolder categorization habit, that deployment didn\u0026rsquo;t support subfolders, so I never looked into it deeply. Well, since I\u0026rsquo;m trying to get things done this time, let\u0026rsquo;s see if my current Hugo blog can be auto-deployed. After all, it\u0026rsquo;s a hassle to download from the container and re-upload every time.\nWorkflow A workflow is defined in a YAML file under the .github/workflows/ directory in your Git repository\u0026rsquo;s root. The filename can be anything; I\u0026rsquo;m doing a deploy, so I\u0026rsquo;ll use deploy.yml.\nThe file structure generally consists of a name, a trigger, and jobs.\nName This is straightforward, just give it a name.\n1 name: Build and Deploy Hugo Blog Trigger Action Workflows can be triggered in multiple ways. For me, triggering on every push is enough since I mostly just update articles and then build.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll also add a manual trigger, just in case a GitHub configuration error means the Action Workflow won\u0026rsquo;t start until the next push.\n1 2 3 4 5 on: push: # Trigger on Git Push branches: - main # Listen for updates on the source repository\u0026#39;s main branch workflow_dispatch: # Manual trigger Jobs I only have one job here; you can have multiple jobs that run in parallel.\nFirst, name the job.\n1 2 jobs: build-deploy: Then, define the runner; I chose Ubuntu.\n1 2 3 jobs: build-deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-latest Next, define the execution steps. The first step is to clone the repository.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 jobs: build-deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout source uses: actions/checkout@v4 Then, install Hugo.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 steps: - name: Setup Hugo uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2 with: hugo-version: \u0026#39;0.140.1\u0026#39; # This is my local version; higher compatibility extended: true # My theme uses SCSS, so the extended version is required Next, the build command.\n1 2 3 steps: - name: Build Hugo Site run: hugo --minify Push to my GitHub Pages deployment repository.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 steps: - name: Deploy to BlogWeb repo uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 with: external_repository: yexca/Blog-Web-Hugo publish_branch: main # Push to the main branch of the target repo yexca/Blog-Web-Hugo publish_dir: ./public # The folder to push from the current repo; Hugo defaults to this folder personal_token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_TOKEN }} So, putting it all together, it looks like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 name: Build and Deploy Hugo Blog on: push: branches: - main workflow_dispatch: jobs: build-deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout source uses: actions/checkout@v4 - name: Setup Hugo uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2 with: hugo-version: \u0026#39;0.140.1\u0026#39; extended: true - name: Build Hugo site run: hugo --minify - name: Deploy to blogWeb repo uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 with: external_repository: yexca/Blog-Web-Hugo publish_branch: main publish_dir: ./public personal_token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_TOKEN }} Configuring the Token Since accessing other repositories requires a Token, you need to generate one.\nGo to your Settings -\u0026gt; Developer Settings -\u0026gt; Personal access tokens -\u0026gt; Fine-grained tokens and generate a Token with read/write permissions for the specified repository.\nThen, configure it in your source repository. Mine is yexca/Blog-Source-Hugo. Go to the repository\u0026rsquo;s Settings -\u0026gt; Secrets and variables -\u0026gt; Actions and add the generated Token under Repository secrets. The name should be PERSONAL_TOKEN, as configured earlier.\nHandling Domain Issues If your GitHub Pages uses a custom domain, there\u0026rsquo;s a file named CNAME that contains your custom domain. When GitHub Actions Workflow pushes, it effectively deletes all previous content before pushing new content, so the CNAME file will also be deleted. You need to add this file before pushing to ensure your custom domain works. There are two methods:\nOne is to create the file within the workflow:\n1 2 3 steps: - name: Add CNAME run: echo \u0026#39;blog.yexca.net\u0026#39; \u0026gt; public/CNAME Or, simply place a CNAME file directly in Hugo\u0026rsquo;s static folder, as its contents will be copied directly to the generated content\u0026rsquo;s root directory.\nTheme Module Issues Because my original theme was added using Git Submodules, pushing it would directly link to the corresponding GitHub repo. However, I\u0026rsquo;ve made significant modifications that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be uploaded to GitHub. Therefore, I need to detach the link.\nBackup Theme Files Before doing anything, back up your theme by copying it to another folder.\n1 cp -r themes/Hugo-Theme-Stack tmp/Hugo-Theme-Stack-Backup Remove Submodule Configuration First, deinitialize the submodule.\n1 git submodule deinit -f themes/Hugo-Theme-Stack Remove it from Git.\n1 git rm -f themes/Hugo-Theme-Stack Remove the files.\n1 rm -rf .git/modules/themes/Hugo-Theme-Stack Also, delete the .gitmodules file in the root directory.\n1 rm .gitmodules Restore Theme Now, move the backed-up files back.\n1 cp -r tmp/Hugo-Theme-Stack-Backup themes/Hugo-Theme-Stack Delete the backup files (you can test first before deleting).\n1 rm -rf tmp Fixing JS Specification Errors My previous blog\u0026rsquo;s runtime used an older octal number syntax, and since I used the hugo --minify command to build and compress, it led to errors.\nThe fix was quite simple. The original code was:\n1 Date.UTC(2021, 10, 06, 14, 15, 19) Changed to:\n1 Date.UTC(2021, 10, 6, 14, 15, 19) Conclusion Finally, I\u0026rsquo;m free from local compilation. Ever since I started using Docker, I gradually got used to isolating my development environment from my local system. This way, if I change systems or servers, I just transfer the container. So development has always been isolated from the physical machine, and I\u0026rsquo;ve slowly developed an \u0026ldquo;environment hygiene\u0026rdquo; habit.\nNow it\u0026rsquo;s even better: building and deploying aren\u0026rsquo;t even local anymore. Before, it was isolated to containers; now, it\u0026rsquo;s isolated to the cloud. My environment hygiene habit is completely cured, I guess.\nBut looking at DevOps again, I feel like it\u0026rsquo;s a product of today\u0026rsquo;s increasingly competitive landscape and ever-convenient technological advancements.\nFrom early machine adaptation and assembly to the advent of high-level languages, then containerized deployment breaking environmental barriers—each technological iteration brings improved efficiency and lowers the barrier to entry, while subtly raising the \u0026ldquo;starting line.\u0026rdquo;\nWhile it brings greater convenience to programming life, it also quietly raises the industry\u0026rsquo;s entry bar, making me obsolete faster, I guess.\nHowever, work is work, and life is life. Technology iterates fast, but world systems and industries don\u0026rsquo;t change that quickly. There should still be some breathing room for us.\n","date":"2025-05-16T18:14:06+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/247/","title":"Embracing DevOps: Offloading My Blog Build and Deploy to GitHub"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash Introduction Another self-introduction, and my blog popped into my mind again.\nI used to just Google yexca, click the first result, and land on my blog. But ever since changing domains, I\u0026rsquo;ve searched for yexca countless times, and my blog just vanishes from the results.\nInitially, I didn\u0026rsquo;t worry much, thinking maybe there was some penalty. Google recommends a year of 301 redirects after a domain change, but I only did six months before the old domain expired.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s been two years now, right? It should have recovered by now.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s crazier is that some old, unmaintained sites rank higher. Meanwhile, my blog, which I update, optimize, and tinker with daily, seems completely forgotten by the world.\nSo, I Started Looking for Answers Opened my blog, checked the \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; section. Huh? Why is \u0026lt;meta name='description'\u0026gt; just that tagline on the left side of the page?\nAh, when I configured it, it just said it would appear there. I thought it was similar to Argon\u0026rsquo;s setup. So, this site\u0026rsquo;s description is essentially meaningless.\nBut that phrase has been with me through my entire blogging journey; I don\u0026rsquo;t want to give it up easily. Alright, then let\u0026rsquo;s use JSON-LD for structured data!\nSo, I added this to the theme\u0026rsquo;s custom \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; section:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 \u0026lt;script type=\u0026#34;application/ld+json\u0026#34;\u0026gt; { \u0026#34;@context\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://schema.org\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;@type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Blog\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;yexca\u0026#39;Blog\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;{{ .Site.BaseURL }}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;inLanguage\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;{{ .Site.Language.Lang }}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;{{ .Site.Params.description }}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;author\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;@type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Person\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;yexca\u0026#34; } } \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Yeah, also considering it\u0026rsquo;s a multilingual site, using variables for some content is definitely better.\nNavigating the Language Maze Speaking of multilingual sites, what if I search in a different language environment? So I searched yexca on google.com.hk, google.com.tw, and google.com.jp.\nTurns out, my blog shows up in Japanese search results, but not in Chinese. As for English, I don\u0026rsquo;t have many articles, so it\u0026rsquo;s whatever.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s really weird. Google should be able to identify https://blog.yexca.net as yexca, but why are the other language versions doing so poorly?\nDigging deeper, I realized hreflang configuration might be missing, so I added:\n1 2 3 4 5 \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;alternate\u0026#34; hreflang=\u0026#34;x-default\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;https://blog.yexca.net/\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;alternate\u0026#34; hreflang=\u0026#34;zh-CN\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;https://blog.yexca.net/\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;alternate\u0026#34; hreflang=\u0026#34;zh-TW\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;https://blog.yexca.net/zh-tw/\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;alternate\u0026#34; hreflang=\u0026#34;ja\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;https://blog.yexca.net/ja/\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;alternate\u0026#34; hreflang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;https://blog.yexca.net/en/\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; This explicitly tells search engines that users of different languages can access different language versions, and it\u0026rsquo;s all the same website.\nBTW, this \u0026lt;link\u0026gt; block also appears on article pages because there\u0026rsquo;s no conditional logic. But not all articles on my blog have all language versions, so this doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to change; Google will understand it automatically.\nPatching Up the Gaps But I randomly opened an article, and oops, it still had the JSON-LD site description. That felt a bit odd.

Some swipe cards like designers, and design systems like they live life.\n1. Introduction: What is a Card Enthusiast? Let’s start with something I once saw online—the seven favorite hobbies of card enthusiasts:\nNote: “Mainland China” here refers to regions where capital inflow and outflow are restricted.\nFinding ways to spend foreign currency in China Finding ways to spend RMB abroad Finding ways to move RMB out of the country Finding ways to bring foreign currency in Applying for cards that are useless in China Applying for cards that are even more useless abroad Trying to move around money that doesn’t even reach the length of a typical PIN code, across a bunch of nearly useless cards Note: In mainland China, bank PINs are usually 6 digits. This is a self-deprecating joke meaning “my balance doesn’t even reach 6 digits, but I’m still shuffling it like it matters.” May not apply elsewhere.\nIt may sound like a financial game—applying for cards, chasing cashback, reducing fees, optimizing exchanges\u0026hellip; Seems like a bunch of petty tricks.\nBut for true card enthusiasts:\nIt’s not about saving a few bucks—it\u0026rsquo;s about designing an optimal, multi-channel, multi-constraint capital flow system.\nThey’re not milking the system. They’re exploring the architecture of reality, optimizing the structure of everyday life.\n2. What Does a System Architect Actually Do? To become a certified system architect, you need to learn all kinds of jargon—modular decoupling, performance optimization, API specification, and more. But beyond the terms, the real job is simple:\nFaced with complex constraints, allocate resources, design routes, and connect systems to build something stable yet flexible.\nA system architect isn’t just writing beautiful code or drawing diagrams. Their main concern is: will the system work in real-world chaos? For example:\nHow should modules divide responsibilities? How should services interact? How can interfaces be defined for future expansion? How do we locate issues and isolate failures? How do we balance performance and cost under limited resources? Their role is part LEGO builder, part road engineer, part system patcher. Not given a perfect blueprint from the start, they piece things together step-by-step in a broken and messy world.\nIn short, they design systems that run steadily, adapt quickly, and are affordable to maintain. They don’t chase technical perfection—they chase what works. That’s the beauty of system architecture.\nI only learned these things for an exam, but through that process, I rediscovered my passion for card optimization.\n3. The “Architecture Problems” of Card Enthusiasts Card optimization isn’t just “saving a little money.” And system architecture isn’t just “high-end tech design.” Despite different contexts, they both tackle the same core challenge:\nNavigating constraints, managing costs, and designing optimal structures in an uncertain world.\nCard enthusiasts don’t just apply for cards—they design capital flows.\nSystem architects don’t just code—they design control and data flows.\nCard people ask: how do I reduce fees, avoid risk flags, and ensure smooth transactions?\nArchitects ask: how do I reduce failures, scale up, and maintain stability?\nI originally studied architecture for the test, but looking back—it’s the same thinking I used when optimizing my card flows.\nCard World Architecture World Core Logic Fees Latency / Performance Cost Management Channel Limits API Call Restrictions Protocol Compatibility Card Regulations Module Specifications Compliance FX Disparities Cross-platform Overhead Environment Adaptation Card Diversity Tech Stack Diversity Module Integration Bank Risk Controls Security Strategies Risk Management Flow Paths Data Routing Architectural Routing Card optimization isn’t exploiting loopholes—it’s designing capital flow architectures.\nThey aren’t “doing things.” They’re building structures: not just finding the best cashback card, but designing a path that moves funds with minimal cost and maximum efficiency.\nThey don’t just ask “can it be done,” but “is it elegant.”\nCard optimization is solving a constrained shortest-path problem, just like service topology design is about optimizing module coupling under SLA limits.\nThe difference between them? Just different application domains.\n4. System Practice Through Personal Exploration Others chase cashback. I’m studying the ecosystem.\nEvery card enthusiast’s path is unique. We each deal with different banks, currencies, and lifestyles.\nThe fun doesn’t lie in copying others—but in finding your own optimal flow through trial and error, grounded in real context.\nI started off just trying to save a little on fees. But after digging through endless documentation, I realized: every bank had its own transfer policies, time windows, restrictions. Some offered free morning transfers, others were fast but limited to specific currencies. Some would randomly block transfers. It felt like a fog-of-war map—I had to explore, unlock nodes, and build routes.\nAfter countless small tests, I built a working, cost-effective flow tailored to myself. I avoided high-fee routes, optimized timing, and even exploited currency fluctuations for marginal gains.\nSome goals seemed impossible at first—like sending funds to countries with little infrastructure. But I eventually figured out how: crypto deposits, direct virtual currency payments, fiat-to-stablecoin automation, specialized remittance apps bypassing banks\u0026hellip; I made the impossible possible.\nThis transition—from “unreachable” to “path unlocked”—felt exactly like rebuilding a network architecture.\nI wasn’t just transferring money. I was redefining the structure of value transmission.\nSounds complex? It’s really just a classic systems design problem:\nHow do systems communicate and transfer data? How do we handle format (currency) conversions? Which nodes are reliable? Which paths are low-latency and low-failure? How do we move a “data packet” (money) through protocols (remittance channels) to the destination? Can it feel seamless from the user’s (my) perspective? That’s architecture: not feature-building, but designing a coherent, maintainable, scalable system.\nEach card is a node; each interface is a protocol. Every iteration? A tiny architectural optimization.\nIt’s route planning + interface negotiation + user experience. Sounds familiar, architect?\nCard enthusiasts aren’t just saving money. They’re reconstructing the world’s financial logic and taking control.\n5. Architectural Literacy Forged Through Card Craft Through every route choice, failed experiment, cost balancing act, and risk-management adjustment, card enthusiasts are honing a kind of architectural mindset. No servers, no code—but plenty of real-world structure tuning and efficiency refinement. That process? It\u0026rsquo;s hands-on system design.\nAll these behaviors, over time, naturally evolve into core architectural instincts:\nCapability Real-World Manifestation Architectural Principle Rule Familiarity Mastering bank limits and terms Documentation Literacy Integration Coordinating multi-card workflows System Integration Thinking Cost Awareness Minimizing transaction fees Performance/Cost Tradeoff Modeling Mapping optimal card flow paths Structural Modeling Risk Management Multi-account, failover logic High Availability Design Aesthetic Sense Making money “move elegantly” Engineering Beauty In many ways, card enthusiasts are simulating what it means to think like a systems architect—using the real world as their playground.\n6. My Reflection Fees are the enemy. Channels are sacred. Paths are art.\nI didn’t become a card enthusiast because I love swiping cards—I became one because through each experiment, I found beauty in structure. We may not write code or run servers, but every money transfer, every optimized flow—it’s all a personal exercise in system design.\nFrom prepping for the architecture certification to building my daily financial routes, I’ve come to realize:\nWhat I enjoy isn’t just getting things done—it’s making the path elegant.\nWhat others see as petty tricks, I see as system aesthetics.\nWhat others call loophole hunters, I call life architects.\nCardcraft isn’t just about saving money—it’s a real-world sandbox to train your sense of system design: visualizing problems, iterating solutions, aligning logic with beauty.\nIt’s not a waste of time. It’s a tactile, tangible, deeply personal “practice space” for designing real-world systems.\nIt’s not about saving money. It’s about skill-building.\nIt’s not about invention. It’s about choosing the right structure.\nWhether it’s designing systems or optimizing card flows, the point isn’t how much you saved or how many lines you wrote—it’s how much better you understand how the world works.\nAnd I? I’m the kind of person who stands in front of an ATM for 10 minutes—just to calculate the optimal fee path. Maybe I don’t have a server to deploy, but I’m still architecting.\nConclusion: Life Is the Ultimate Architecture Every time we swipe a card, transfer money, evaluate a route, or make a combination decision—we\u0026rsquo;re engaging in an invisible act of system design.\nArchitecture isn\u0026rsquo;t just about servers and APIs. Sometimes, it\u0026rsquo;s hidden between wallets, bank cards, and payment methods.\nAt the end of the card optimization path, perhaps what we find is not a loophole hunter—\n—but a life architect in disguise.\nAppendix: My Capital Flow in Code This code isn’t meant to be executable—it’s a model of how I think about my real-world money flows. It’s how I express everyday logistics through architectural language.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 // My cross-border capital flow (illustrative) func RouteCNYtoJPY(CNY float64) JPY float64 { HKD := BOCExchange(CNY, to=\u0026#34;HKD\u0026#34;) log.Printf(\u0026#34;Exchanged %.2f CNY to %.2f HKD\u0026#34;, CNY, HKD) Transfer(HKD, from=\u0026#34;BOC\u0026#34;, to=\u0026#34;BOCHK\u0026#34;, by=\u0026#34;pbservice\u0026#34;) log.Println(\u0026#34;Transferred via pbservice → BOCHK\u0026#34;) Transfer(HKD, from=\u0026#34;BOCHK\u0026#34;, to=\u0026#34;Wise\u0026#34;, by=\u0026#34;fpservice\u0026#34;) log.Println(\u0026#34;Transferred via fps → Wise\u0026#34;) JPY := WiseConvert(HKD, to=\u0026#34;JPY\u0026#34;) log.Printf(\u0026#34;Converted %.2f HKD to %.2f JPY via Wise\u0026#34;, HKD, JPY) Deposit(JPY, to=\u0026#34;Revolut\u0026#34;, with=\u0026#34;ApplePay\u0026#34;) return JPY } A code snippet built not for execution, but for expression—a symbolic blueprint connecting everyday money logic to architectural thinking.\nDisclaimer: This article is for entertainment and personal documentation purposes only.

I stopped in April 2025.\nMy last entry: ¥0\nThe Beginning: To Save Money and Gain Control It all started very simply — I wanted to control my spending and build better financial awareness. And in the beginning, it really worked. I successfully curbed some of my bad spending habits.\nThe Process: Stepping Into the World of Optimization and Card Collecting Gradually, in pursuit of “better” consumption, I started comparing everything, looking for the optimal choice. At first, it was just comparing product prices. Later, it expanded to payment methods, tools, and eventually to bank promotions and card applications.\nI applied for cards for discounts, then for convenience, and eventually just for collecting them. Step by step, I had fallen deep into the card-collecting world.\nWhat started as saving money, turned into convenience, and ended up becoming card collecting.\nThe Backfire: When Accounting Became a Burden And so, accounting itself slowly became a burden. More and more accounts, more and more complex scenarios — the time cost and mental cost of bookkeeping had long exceeded its actual benefits.\nThere were times I spent hours researching just to save a few bucks. At first, that felt fun. But after doing it over and over, finding the optimal solution no longer excited me — it just left me feeling empty.\nThe Change: From Seeking The Best to Seeking Comfort Maybe I’ve changed. My approach to consumption has changed too.\nFrom “maximize savings” to “close enough, as long as I’m comfortable.”\nI realized I had already broken through my original spending limits, yet I didn’t lose control. On the contrary, I came to understand more deeply: compared to saving money, my time and my happiness mattered more.\nThe Reflection: Why Am I Even Keeping Accounts? Because of bookkeeping, I started to:\nConstantly dig through records because I had too many accounts Create new accounts in the app frequently due to currency conversions Spend a long time hesitating over whether I should buy something Have my mood ruined during outings with friends over spending details That made me reflect — Why am I even doing this?\nIs it really worth it for the so-called “gains” from bookkeeping?\nThe Decision: Letting Go, Reset, Move On So I tried to let go, to not fuss over the details, and simply asked myself:\n“Am I happy?”\nAnd the result was — yes, I was really happy. And my spending wasn’t as high as I imagined either.\nPerhaps my habits had already trained me to naturally compare prices. Or maybe, emotional value is something that can never be measured by discounts.\nTherefore, I think it’s time to let go.\nAccounting has fulfilled its mission.\nIt’s no longer a tool, but a shackle.\nHabits are meant to improve life.\nIf they can no longer be sustained by passion, and instead get in the way of living, then it’s time to learn to say goodbye.\nThe Ending: Thank You, and Keep Living Giving up a habit I’ve maintained for two years is indeed a little bittersweet.\nBut maybe this is also a part of life. Nothing stays with us forever, but as long as the time spent together was beautiful, that’s enough.\nPerhaps I’ve lost a symbolic tool that made me feel like “I’m good at saving money.”\nBut more than that, I hope my future self won’t rely on numbers and records for a sense of security, but instead, live with true ease and freedom.\nFrom being in control, to flowing into the unknown.\nI hope I can adapt soon.\nAnd I hope I can spend the saved time on things that are more meaningful and more joyful.\nThe Last Entry, ¥0 Leaving a short note here.\nThank you to myself for two years of dedicated tracking.\nFrom now on, I hope to spend the saved time on things that are more meaningful and joyful.\nAnd just like that, I archived this experience.\nRecording ends, but life is only just beginning.\n","date":"2025-04-14T16:23:48+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/244/","title":"From Saving Money, To Living Life, To Saying Goodbye"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash My blog started getting super dry and dull after I began posting more specialized learning content. Seriously, opening it just screamed \u0026lsquo;study time,\u0026rsquo; which built up this mental block against writing. I\u0026rsquo;ve wanted to post other stuff for ages but never got around to it. Well, thanks to some recent events, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna give a non-tech post a shot.\n「まだ雨はやまない」 On 2025-03-23, I grabbed my first physical album: Shigure Ui\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;まだ雨はやまない\u0026rsquo;. The album art, like a photo album, is just too cute!\nBut the purchase journey itself was a bit convoluted. I\u0026rsquo;ve bought too many things that looked cool at first glance but ended up being disappointing. Plus, budget constraints mean I always have to weigh decisions when buying non-essentials. So, getting an album from an artist I barely knew was definitely a risky move (it wasn\u0026rsquo;t cheap, doge).\nI first spotted this album in a physical store back in January (2025). Thought, \u0026rsquo;that\u0026rsquo;s adorable,\u0026rsquo; and the seed to buy it was planted. I also learned about Shigure Ui. Then, on March 22nd, at an exhibition in Okinawa held on VRChat, I saw that Shigure Ui designed Hatsune Miku\u0026rsquo;s image for the event. Felt instantly familiar (and caught the March 23rd livestream).\n初音ミクのライブを見た、可愛かった！\nI watched Hatsune Miku\u0026#39;s live concert, so cute!\n也是看上初音未来的直播了 pic.twitter.com/r1JeMpQ9UA\n\u0026mdash; yexca (@yexcano) March 24, 2025 That got me thinking about the album again. That day, I looked her up, listened to a few tracks, and thought they were pretty good. But when I went to buy it on the 23rd, and actually got to the store, I hesitated. Once I had the album in hand, I started checking it out (I was super torn; usually if I\u0026rsquo;m buying something, I don\u0026rsquo;t research it beforehand – I want the surprise. If I research, I usually don\u0026rsquo;t buy). But I guess I still had that buying urge. I just looked at the tracklist, and since only one song seemed familiar, I popped into the manga store next door, grabbed a comic, and headed home. On the subway, I reflexively opened my music app. Suddenly, a song hit differently – it was amazing! I instinctively hit \u0026lsquo;favorite,\u0026rsquo; but then saw the title and realized, \u0026lsquo;Wait, that\u0026rsquo;s from that album!\u0026rsquo; I immediately U-turned, rushed back to the store, and snagged the album. (Rainy Lady is just that good!)\nRipping the Tracks Honestly, I don\u0026rsquo;t really need to listen to physical albums. So, that leads to the main point of this post: getting the tracks off the album. I mainly followed this guide: https://www.bilibili.com/opus/925630344961458181 I initially planned to just write about my own process, as usual. But some new stuff came up, so I\u0026rsquo;ll just link to it.\n「アルストロメリア」 Yesterday (25th), my plans to game with a friend got pushed because they wanted to go out. So, I figured, why not go out too? And just like that, I stumbled upon Kano\u0026rsquo;s album!!!\nI grabbed it on the spot! My excitement was off the charts. My meager writing skills can\u0026rsquo;t even begin to express how thrilled I was. I\u0026rsquo;m super familiar with Kano, so no ripping needed for these tracks. Opening the album, heart pounding, and seeing that final smile? My soul was completely healed. What an awesome experience.

A computer without any software is often called \u0026ldquo;bare metal.\u0026rdquo; Using bare metal directly is not only inconvenient but also significantly reduces work efficiency and machine utilization. The Operating System (OS) aims to bridge the gap between humans and machines, creating an interface between the user and the computer. It\u0026rsquo;s a type of system software configured for bare metal.\nThe OS\u0026rsquo;s position in a computer system is illustrated below:\nAs shown in the diagram, the OS is the first layer of software on bare metal, extending the hardware\u0026rsquo;s functionality for the first time. It holds a crucial and special position in a computer system. All other software, such as editors, assemblers, compilers, database management systems, and a wide array of application software, are built upon the OS, relying on its support and services.\nFrom a user\u0026rsquo;s perspective, once a computer has an OS, users no longer directly interact with the hardware. Instead, they use the commands and services provided by the OS to operate the computer. The OS has become an indispensable and the most important system software in modern computer systems, thus serving as the interface between the user and the computer.\nProcess Management Process management is also known as processor management. In multi-program batch processing systems and time-sharing systems, multiple programs execute concurrently. To describe the dynamic changes during program execution in such systems, the concept of a process was introduced. A process is the basic unit for resource allocation and independent execution. Process management primarily focuses on studying the concurrent characteristics of various processes, as well as issues arising from inter-process cooperation and resource contention.\nCharacteristics of Sequential Program Execution A precedence graph is a directed acyclic graph composed of nodes and directed edges. Nodes represent operations of different program segments, while directed edges between nodes indicate a precedence relationship. The precedence relationship between program segments Pi and Pj is denoted as Pi→Pj, where Pi is the predecessor of Pj, and Pj is the successor of Pi. This means Pj can only execute after Pi has finished.\nThe image below shows a precedence graph with 3 nodes. Input is a predecessor to calculation; calculation can only proceed after input is complete. Calculation is a predecessor to output; output can only proceed after calculation is complete.\nKey characteristics of sequential program execution include sequentiality, closedness, and reproducibility.\nCharacteristics of Concurrent Program Execution If multi-programming techniques are used in a computer system, multiple programs in main memory can be in a concurrent execution state. For the job type with 3 program segments mentioned above, although program segments with precedence relationships within the same job cannot execute in parallel on the CPU and I/O components, program segments within the same job that lack precedence relationships, or program segments from different jobs, can execute in parallel on the CPU and various I/O components. For instance, in a system with one CPU, one input device, and one output device, the precedence graph is as follows:\nThe characteristics of concurrent program execution are:\nLoss of program closedness. No longer a one-to-one correspondence between program and machine execution activities. Mutual constraints between concurrent programs. Process States and Transitions In a multi-program system, processes run alternately on the processor, and their states continuously change. Thus, processes generally have 3 basic states: running, ready, and blocked.\nRunning. When a program is executing on the processor, the process is said to be in a running state. Obviously, for a single-processor system, there is only one process in the running state. Ready. A process that has acquired all necessary resources except the processor, and can run as soon as it gets the processor, is said to be in a ready state. Blocked. Also called the waiting or sleeping state. A process temporarily stops execution while waiting for a specific event to occur (e.g., waiting for I/O completion after an I/O request). In this state, even if the processor is allocated to the process, it cannot run. Hence, it\u0026rsquo;s called a blocked state. Process State CPU Resources Running √ √ Ready × √ Blocked × × Five-State Model In reality, for an actual system, process states and their transitions are more complex. For example, introducing \u0026ldquo;New\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Terminated\u0026rdquo; states forms the five-state process model.\nInter-Process Communication In a multi-program environment, with multiple processes that can execute concurrently, issues of resource sharing and mutual cooperation between processes inevitably arise. Inter-process communication (IPC) refers to the process by which various processes exchange information.\nSynchronization vs. Mutual Exclusion: Synchronization deals with direct constraints between cooperating processes, while mutual exclusion deals with indirect constraints between processes contending for critical resources.\nProcess Synchronization In a computer system, multiple processes can execute concurrently, each advancing at its own independent, unpredictable speed. However, they need to coordinate their work at certain specific points when cooperating. For instance, if Process A is putting data into a buffer, Process B must wait until Process A\u0026rsquo;s operation is complete.\nThus, process synchronization refers to the coordination required among processes that need to cooperate and work together within the system.\nProcess Mutual Exclusion Process mutual exclusion refers to multiple processes in the system executing exclusively due to contention for a critical resource. In a multi-program environment, processes can share various resources. However, some resources can only be used by one process at a time. These are called Critical Resources (CR), such as printers, shared variables, and tables.\nPrinciples of Critical Section Management A Critical Section (CS) is the part of a process\u0026rsquo;s code that operates on a critical resource. The four principles for managing mutually exclusive critical sections are:\nEnter if Empty. If no process is currently in the critical section, a process is allowed to enter it, and it should run for only a finite time within the critical section. Exclusive Access. If a process is in the critical section, other processes attempting to enter must wait, ensuring mutually exclusive access to the critical resource. Bounded Waiting. For processes requesting access to a critical resource, it should be guaranteed that the process can enter the critical section within a finite amount of time, preventing \u0026ldquo;starvation.\u0026rdquo; Yield Processor if Waiting. When a process cannot enter its critical section, it should immediately release the processor (CPU) to avoid busy-waiting. Semaphore Mechanism The semaphore mechanism, proposed by Dutch scholar Dijkstra in 1965, is an effective tool for process synchronization and mutual exclusion. Currently, semaphore mechanisms have evolved significantly, mainly including integer semaphores, record semaphores, and semaphore set mechanisms.\nInteger Semaphores and PV Operations A semaphore is an integer variable, assigned different values based on the controlled object. Semaphores are divided into two categories:\nGeneral Semaphores. Used to achieve mutual exclusion between processes, initially valued at 1 or the number of available resources. Private Semaphores. Used to achieve synchronization between processes, initially valued at 0 or some positive integer. The physical meaning of semaphore S: S ≥ 0 indicates the number of available resources. If S \u0026lt; 0, its absolute value represents the number of processes waiting for that resource in the blocked queue.\nFor every process in the system, its correct operation depends not only on its own correctness but also on its ability to correctly implement synchronization and mutual exclusion with other related processes during execution. PV operations are common methods for implementing process synchronization and mutual exclusion. P and V operations are low-level communication primitives and are indivisible during execution. The P operation requests a resource, and the V operation releases a resource.\nDefinition of P Operation S := S - 1. If S ≥ 0, the process executing the P operation continues. Otherwise, the process is set to a blocked state (due to no available resources) and inserted into the blocked queue.\nThe P operation can be represented by the following procedure, where Semaphore indicates that the defined variable is a semaphore:\n1 2 3 4 5 Procedure P(Var S:Semaphore); Begain S := S - 1; If S \u0026lt; 0 then W(S) {Insert process executing P operation into waiting queue} End; Definition of V Operation S := S + 1. If S \u0026gt; 0, the process executing the V operation continues. Otherwise, a process is awakened from the blocked state and inserted into the ready queue, then the process executing the V operation continues.\nThe V operation can be represented by the following procedure:\n1 2 3 4 5 Procedure V(Var S:Semaphore); Begain S := S + 1; If S \u0026lt;= 0 then R(S) {Wake up a process from the blocked queue} End; Implementing Process Mutual Exclusion with PV Operations For example, the following two processes might lead to incorrect changes in the COUNT value:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 # 1 if a car passes then COUNT := COUNT + 1; GOTO L1; # 2 PRINT COUNT; COUNT := 0; GOTO L2; Let the initial value of the mutex semaphore be 1. Execute a P operation to lock the resource before entering the critical section, and a V operation after leaving it. The code is as follows:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 # 1 if a car passes then begin P(mutex) COUNT := COUNT + 1; V(mutex) end GOTO L1; # 2 begin P(mutex) PRINT COUNT; COUNT := 0; V(mutex) end GOTO L2; Recommended viewing: 【操作系统】进程间通信—互斥 (Operating Systems: Inter-Process Communication - Mutual Exclusion)\nImplementing Process Synchronization with PV Operations Process synchronization arises from mutual constraints due to process cooperation. To achieve process synchronization, a semaphore can be linked to a message. When the semaphore\u0026rsquo;s value is 0, it means the desired message has not been produced. When its value is non-zero, it means the desired message already exists. Suppose semaphore S represents a certain message. A process can test if the message has arrived by calling the P operation, and notify that the message is ready by calling the V operation. The most typical synchronization problem is the single-buffer producer-consumer synchronization problem.\nRecommended viewing: 【操作系统】进程间通信—同步 (Operating Systems: Inter-Process Communication - Synchronization)\nDeadlock Caused by Improper Allocation of Homogeneous Resources If a system has m resources shared by n processes, and each process requires k resources, a deadlock might occur if m \u0026lt; nk, meaning the total number of resources is less than the total required by all processes.\nFor example, if m=5, n=3, k=3, and the system uses a round-robin allocation strategy, the system first allocates one resource to each process in the first round, leaving two resources. In the second round, the system allocates one more resource to two processes. At this point, no resources are available for allocation, causing all processes to be in a waiting state, leading to system deadlock.\nIn fact, a deadlock will not occur when m ≥ n × (k - 1).\nDeadlock Handling The main strategies for handling deadlocks are four: the Ostrich Algorithm (i.e., the ignore strategy), prevention strategy, avoidance strategy, and detection and recovery.\nDeadlock Prevention Deadlock prevention involves adopting a strategy to restrict concurrent processes\u0026rsquo; resource requests, thereby breaking one of the four necessary conditions for deadlock, ensuring the system never meets the deadlock conditions at any time. Two strategies for deadlock prevention are:\nPre-allocation (Static Allocation). This breaks the \u0026ldquo;no preemption\u0026rdquo; condition by allocating all required resources beforehand, ensuring no waiting for resources. The problem with this method is that it reduces resource utilization and process concurrency; sometimes, required resources cannot be known in advance. Resource Ordering Allocation. This breaks the \u0026ldquo;circular wait\u0026rdquo; condition by classifying resources and arranging them in a specific order, ensuring no circular wait forms. The problem with this method is that it restricts processes\u0026rsquo; resource requests and resource ordering incurs system overhead. Deadlock Avoidance Deadlock avoidance aims to break one of the four necessary conditions for deadlock, strictly preventing deadlocks from occurring. Deadlock avoidance does not restrict the necessary conditions as strictly. The most famous deadlock avoidance algorithm is Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s Banker\u0026rsquo;s Algorithm. Deadlock avoidance algorithms typically require significant system overhead.\nRecommended viewing: 银行家算法 (Banker\u0026rsquo;s Algorithm)\nThreads Traditional processes have two fundamental attributes: they are an independent unit for owning resources and an independent unit for scheduling and allocation. Threads were introduced because process creation, destruction, and switching incur significant time and space overhead for the system. Therefore, the number of processes in a system should not be too high, and the frequency of process switching should not be too high, which limits the improvement of concurrency.\nWith the introduction of threads, these two fundamental attributes of traditional processes are separated. A thread acts as the basic unit of scheduling and allocation, while a process serves as the unit for independent resource allocation. Users can create threads to complete tasks, reducing the time and space overhead when programs execute concurrently.\nThis way, the basic unit for resource ownership doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to switch frequently, further increasing the concurrency of programs within the system. It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that a thread is an entity within a process, a basic unit independently allocated and scheduled by the system. Threads typically own minimal resources (like a program counter, a set of registers, and a stack) but can share all resources owned by their parent process with other threads belonging to the same process.\n","date":"2025-03-16T19:35:38+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/242/","title":"Software Designer - Operating System Notes"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash This article was written on 2024-04-29, then revised once.

That is, until I saw some nice Japanese fonts while browsing. I had to snag them, only to realize the fonts for my other languages were\u0026hellip; well, pretty rough.\nImporting Fonts Google Fonts Using a service like Google Fonts is usually the fastest and easiest way.\nFor example, I\u0026rsquo;m using Comic Neue, Noto Sans JP, Noto Sans SC, Noto Sans TC, and Yomogi. After selecting them, Google Fonts generates an HTML tag to drop into your \u0026lt;head\u0026gt;.\n1 \u0026lt;link href=\u0026#34;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Comic+Neue:ital,wght@0,300;0,400;0,700;1,300;1,400;1,700\u0026amp;family=Noto+Sans+JP:wght@100..900\u0026amp;family=Noto+Sans+SC:wght@100..900\u0026amp;family=Noto+Sans+TC:wght@100..900\u0026amp;family=Yomogi\u0026amp;display=swap\u0026#34; rel=\u0026#34;stylesheet\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Custom Imports You can also host your own .ttf, .woff, or .woff2 files. I recommend .woff2 or .woff for smaller file sizes. (Advanced optimization involves font subsetting/splitting, which is how Google Fonts handles it).\nI\u0026rsquo;m using the Yozai Font . The original .ttf is massive, so I compressed it using a tool like Transfonter before importing.\nFirst, place the font files in a directory, then define the font family in your SCSS.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s my setup. Usually, .woff2 and .woff are enough. I kept .ttf for legacy browser support (honestly, I just uploaded it before I knew better and had to optimize later).\nSet font-display: swap; so the browser uses a fallback font while downloading. This prevents blank text and improves the user experience.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 @font-face { font-family: \u0026#39;yozai\u0026#39;; src: url(\u0026#39;/fonts/Yozai-Regular.woff2\u0026#39;) format(\u0026#39;woff2\u0026#39;), // url(\u0026#39;/fonts/Yozai-Regular.woff\u0026#39;) format(\u0026#39;woff\u0026#39;), url(\u0026#39;/fonts/Yozai-Regular.ttf\u0026#39;) format(\u0026#39;truetype\u0026#39;); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-display: swap; } Where to Put It For Google Fonts, my theme has a custom.html for code that needs to go into the \u0026lt;head\u0026gt;.\nFor self-hosted files, the theme provides a custom.scss.\nFont configurations are handled in variables.scss in my theme, so I modified that directly.\nConfiguring Fonts Set specific fonts based on the language.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 /** * Global font family */ :root { // --sys-font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \u0026#34;Segoe UI\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Droid Sans\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Helvetica Neue\u0026#34;; --sys-font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, \u0026#34;Segoe UI\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Helvetica Neue\u0026#34;, Arial, sans-serif; --zh-font-family: \u0026#34;yozai\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Noto Sans SC\u0026#34;, var(--sys-font-family); --zh-TW-font-family: \u0026#34;yozai\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Noto Sans TC\u0026#34;, var(--sys-font-family); --ja-font-family: \u0026#34;Yomogi\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Noto Sans JP\u0026#34;, var(--sys-font-family); --en-font-family: \u0026#34;Comic Sans MS\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Comic Neue\u0026#34;, var(--sys-font-family); --base-font-family: var(--sys-font-family), sans-serif; --code-font-family: ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, \u0026#34;Liberation Mono\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Courier New\u0026#34;, monospace; } I added font variables for other languages following the existing naming convention.

Pris-Magic! https://blog.yexca.net/archives/260 Introduction Just by the title, I roughly grasped the song\u0026rsquo;s meaning, and it also triggered my past thoughts on life. Before, I could never find an answer to \u0026ldquo;why live?\u0026rdquo;. But, flipping it, \u0026ldquo;why not end it?\u0026rdquo;. I explored ways to commit suicide and their consequences. I realized I feared suicide. So, because of that fear, I chose to live. This perfectly aligns with the song.\nSpeaking of which, I\u0026rsquo;ve listened to many works by Kohana Lam before. Back then, she\u0026rsquo;d often sing tearfully, which made it hard for me to watch sometimes. I was genuinely worried if she\u0026rsquo;d be okay. Then, YouTube Music pushed new, cheerful songs from her. I was genuinely happy she\u0026rsquo;d moved past her sadness (even though I hadn\u0026rsquo;t).\nAfter diving deep into this song (and understanding the lyrics), I realized how great it is. Wish I\u0026rsquo;d found it sooner. Also, I think this series of articles is pretty cool. It\u0026rsquo;s taught me so much from songs I only partially understood before. I feel like this isn\u0026rsquo;t just learning Japanese from songs; it\u0026rsquo;s learning about life. Discovering a different side to songs I\u0026rsquo;d heard before is truly amazing.

Both topics are usually covered together for the exam, so I studied them concurrently.\nFirewall Technology A firewall is a filtering and blocking mechanism deployed at the boundary between internal and external networks. It assumes the internal network is secure and trustworthy, while the external network is not.\nIts role is to prevent unwanted, unauthorized access into and out of the protected internal network, thereby strengthening internal network security policies through boundary control.\nFirewalls are fundamental and core control measures in network security. They span the main controlled network communication lines, performing security processing (like control, auditing, alarming, and reaction) for any communication behavior passing through these lines. They also handle significant communication loads. Given their critical position in network systems and the constant security threats they face, choosing a secure, stable, and reliable firewall product is paramount.\nFirewall technology has evolved through three main stages: packet filtering, application proxy gateways, and stateful inspection.\nPacket Filtering Firewalls Packet filtering firewalls typically have a packet inspection block (often called a packet filter). Packet filtering controls access between sites, sites and networks, or networks and networks based on information in the packet header. However, it can\u0026rsquo;t control the content of transmitted data, as content is application layer data, and the packet filter operates between the network and data link layers (i.e., TCP and IP layers). The inspection module allows the firewall to intercept and examine all outbound and inbound data. It first opens the packet, extracts the header, determines if the packet conforms to the packet filtering rules based on the header info, and logs it. Packets that don\u0026rsquo;t conform to the rules should trigger an alert and be dropped.\nPacket filtering firewalls usually forward packets directly; they are completely transparent to users and operate quickly. Their advantages include: low-level control over every incoming and outgoing packet; examination of each IP packet field (e.g., source address, destination address, protocol, port); ability to identify and drop packets with spoofed source IP addresses; acting as the sole source of access between two networks; and often being integrated into router software, eliminating the need for extra systems. Disadvantages include: inability to defend against hacker attacks, as network admins cannot distinguish reliable from unreliable network boundaries; lack of application layer protocol support because they don\u0026rsquo;t recognize application layer protocols within packets, leading to coarse-grained access control; and inability to handle new security threats.\nApplication Proxy Gateway Firewalls Application proxy gateway firewalls completely sever direct communication between internal and external networks. An internal user\u0026rsquo;s access to the external network becomes the firewall\u0026rsquo;s access to the external network, which is then forwarded by the firewall to the internal user. All communications must be forwarded by application layer proxy software. At no point can a visitor establish a direct TCP connection with the server; the application layer protocol session must comply with the proxy\u0026rsquo;s security policy requirements.\nAdvantages of application proxy gateways include their ability to inspect protocol features at the application, transport, and network layers, providing strong packet inspection capabilities. Disadvantages are their complexity to configure and very slow processing speeds.\nStateful Inspection Firewalls Stateful inspection firewalls combine the security of proxy firewalls with the high speed of packet filtering firewalls. They enhance the performance of proxy firewalls without compromising security.\nViruses Characteristics of computer viruses include: transmissibility, stealth, infectivity, latency, triggerability, and destructiveness.\nWorm refers to worm viruses, Trojan to Trojan horses, Backdoor to backdoor viruses, and Macro to macro viruses.\nMacro viruses primarily infect text documents, spreadsheets, etc.\nTrojan software: Binghe\nWorm viruses: Happy99, Panda Burning Incense, Code Red, ILOVEYOU, Stuxnet.\nNetwork Attacks Denial of Service (DoS) Attack: Aims to make a computer or network unable to provide normal services. DoS attacks are typically executed by continuously sending requests to a target computer.\nReplay Attack: An attacker sends a message that the target host has already accepted to achieve an attack goal. Attackers steal authentication credentials using network sniffing or other methods, then resend them to the authentication server. Primarily used during the authentication process to undermine its correctness.\nPassword Attack: Attackers log into the target host using the account and password of a legitimate user, then carry out malicious activities.\nTrojan Horse: Disguised as a legitimate program or game. When a user downloads software or an attachment containing the Trojan, the program initiates a connection request to the attacker. Once connected, the attacker carries out malicious activities.\nPort Exploitation Attack: Involves using port scanning to find system vulnerabilities and then exploit them.\nNetwork Sniffing: Attackers can intercept all information transmitted over a specific network segment on the same physical channel. Network sniffing allows for easy capture of data, including usernames and passwords.\nIP Spoofing Attack: Involves generating IP packets with a forged source IP address to impersonate another system or sender.\nSQL Injection Attack: One of the common methods hackers use to attack databases. It exploits applications that fail to validate the legitimacy of user input, creating security vulnerabilities. Attackers can submit a piece of database query code. Based on the program\u0026rsquo;s response, they can obtain desired data. By first gaining database privileges, they can acquire user account and password information, and even modify data.\nIntrusion Detection Techniques: Expert systems, model-based detection, simple pattern matching.\nNetwork Security SSL (Secure Socket Layer) is a transport layer security protocol developed by Netscape in 1994 to enable secure Web communication. The SSL 3.0 protocol draft, released in 1996, became a de facto Web security standard.\nTLS (Transport Layer Security) is an IETF-defined protocol. It builds upon the SSL 3.0 protocol specification and is the successor to SSL 3.0.\nThe protocol for secure connections between client devices and remote sites is SSH. SSH, short for Secure Shell, is an IETF-defined security protocol built upon the application and transport layers. It\u0026rsquo;s specifically designed to provide security for remote login sessions and other network services. By using SSH, information leakage during remote management can be effectively prevented. SSH originated as a program on UNIX and quickly expanded to other operating platforms.\nHTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol over Secure Socket Layer) is an HTTP channel designed for security, meaning it\u0026rsquo;s HTTP employing SSL encryption.\nMIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is an internet standard that extends the email standard to support: non-ASCII text, non-textual attachments (binary, audio, images, etc.), messages composed of multiple parts, and header information containing non-ASCII characters.\nPGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is email encryption software based on the RSA public-key cryptosystem. It can be used to keep emails confidential, preventing unauthorized reading, and to add a digital signature, allowing the recipient to verify the sender of the email.\n","date":"2025-03-04T18:38:28+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/238/","title":"Software Designer - InfoSec Notes"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Introduction Recently, I found that IDM couldn\u0026rsquo;t automatically capture files shared via OneDrive.

I hadn\u0026rsquo;t posted them because they\u0026rsquo;re mostly just raw knowledge points, not a polished article. But they\u0026rsquo;re notes nonetheless, and it\u0026rsquo;s handy to have them on the blog for quick reference.\n1. Network Devices Layer Device Isolates Broadcast Domain Isolates Collision Domain Physical Layer Repeater / Hub ✗ ✗ Data Link Layer Bridge / Switch ✗ ✓ Network Layer Router ✓ ✓ Physical Layer Interconnection Devices Physical layer interconnection devices include Repeaters and Hubs.\nRepeater\nIt interconnects LAN segments at the physical layer, used to extend the length of LAN segments.\nHub\nA hub can be seen as a special multi-port repeater, also capable of signal amplification.\nData Link Layer Interconnection Devices Data link layer interconnection devices include Bridges and Switches.\nBridge\nA bridge connects two LAN segments.\nSwitch\nA switch is essentially a multi-port bridge.\nNetwork Layer Interconnection Devices A Router is a network layer interconnection device, used to connect multiple logically separate networks.\nApplication Layer Interconnection Devices A Gateway is an application layer interconnection device. When connecting networks of different types with significant protocol differences, a gateway is required.\n2. Protocol Suites The TCP/IP protocol suite for computer networks.\n3. TCP and UDP Internet Layer Protocol: IP The Internet Layer (Network Layer) is central to the entire TCP/IP suite. Besides IP, other key protocols defined here include ICMP, ARP, and RARP.\nIP\u0026rsquo;s service is generally considered connectionless and unreliable. However, under good network conditions, IP-transmitted data can reach its destination intact.\nConnectionless transmission means sending data without confirming the destination system is ready to receive it. In contrast, connection-oriented transmission (like TCP) requires a three-way handshake between source and destination before application-layer data transfer.\nAs for unreliable service, it means the destination system doesn\u0026rsquo;t acknowledge successfully received packets. IP just tries its best to deliver data. If reliability is needed, higher-layer protocols must implement additional services to ensure successful packet delivery.\nSince IP only offers connectionless, unreliable service, error detection and flow control are delegated to other layers. This is a key reason for TCP/IP\u0026rsquo;s efficiency.\nTransport Layer Protocol: TCP TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is one of the most important protocols in the TCP/IP suite. Building on IP\u0026rsquo;s unreliable data service, it provides applications with a reliable, connection-oriented, full-duplex data transfer service.\nReliable transmission, connection management, error checking and retransmission, flow control, congestion control, port addressing.\nFlow control, in particular, uses a variable-size sliding window protocol.\nBoth establishing and closing a TCP connection between source and destination hosts require a three-way handshake to confirm success.\nTransport Layer Protocol: UDP User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is an unreliable, connectionless protocol that enables communication between application processes. Compared to TCP, also in the transport layer, UDP is connectionless and has much weaker error detection. Simply put, TCP helps provide reliability, while UDP boosts transmission speed. For example, applications requiring interactive sessions (like FTP) often use TCP, while those performing their own error detection or needing none (like DNS, SNMP) typically use UDP.\nThe primary role of UDP protocol software is to present UDP messages to the application layer. It does not retransmit lost or erroneous data messages, reorder out-of-sequence IP datagrams, eliminate duplicate IP datagrams, acknowledge received datagrams, or establish/terminate connections. These concerns are handled by the applications using UDP for communication.\nWhile TCP provides reliable data transfer, it does so at the cost of overhead. This means TCP requires more time and traffic to accomplish the same task. Sacrificing some time for network reliability is acceptable when the network is unreliable. However, in highly reliable networks, UDP can be used to minimize traffic waste.\n4. SMTP and POP3 Email is an electronic medium for information exchange using computers. It emerged with computer networks, relying on network communication to transmit mail. It\u0026rsquo;s one of the most widely used services.\nEmail systems operate on a client/server model. Email servers primarily use SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). This protocol defines email message format and delivery methods, ensuring correct addressing and reliable transmission. As a text-oriented network protocol, its limitation is the inability to transmit non-ASCII text and non-text attachments, which becomes more apparent in the growing multimedia environment and concerns over email privacy.\nLater protocols, including MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) and PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Mail), addressed SMTP\u0026rsquo;s shortcomings. SMTP is used in large multi-user, multi-tasking operating systems, making it difficult to receive mail on PCs. Therefore, most mail management programs on TCP/IP networks use SMTP for sending mail and POP (Post Office Protocol, commonly POP3) to store mail not yet retrieved by users.\nPOP has two versions: POP2 and POP3. Currently, POP3 can be used with SMTP or independently for sending and receiving emails. POP is a simple, plain-text protocol; each transfer handles an entire email, without partial transfers.\nBoth SMTP and POP3 (for receiving mail) use TCP ports. SMTP uses port 25, and POP3 uses port 110.\n5. ARP, RARP, and DHCP ARP and RARP Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) are other important protocols residing in the Internet Layer (Network Layer). ARP translates IP addresses to physical addresses, while RARP translates physical addresses to IP addresses.\nEvery network device – hosts, routers, switches, etc. – has a unique physical address, provided by its network card. Each NIC has a distinct ID from the factory, meaning a unique physical address. On the other hand, to abstract away underlying protocols and physical address differences, the IP protocol uses IP addresses. Thus, IP and physical addresses must be inter-converted during data transmission.\nThe process for IP-to-physical address conversion using ARP is: When a computer needs to communicate with another, it first checks its ARP cache. If the IP address is found, it uses the corresponding physical address to directly send the datagram to the target NIC. If the ARP cache doesn\u0026rsquo;t contain the IP address, ARP sends an ARP request packet as a broadcast on the LAN.\nIf a computer on the LAN matches the requested IP address, it generates an ARP reply containing its physical address. The ARP protocol software then adds this IP-to-physical address mapping to its cache, and data communication can begin.\nDHCP DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) centralizes IP address management and allocation, allowing hosts in a network environment to dynamically obtain IP addresses, Gateway addresses, DNS server addresses, and other information, while also improving address utilization.\nA DHCP client can obtain its own IP address, DNS server address, DHCP server address, and default gateway address from a DHCP server.\nWindows invalid address: 169.254.x.x\nLinux invalid address: 0.0.0.0\n169.254.x.x is the IP address Windows automatically assigns to a client when DHCP lease acquisition fails.\n6. IP Addresses and Subnet Masks IP Addresses Internet addresses are described by names, making them easy to understand and remember. However, hosts on the Internet are uniquely identified by IP addresses. This is because the Internet uses the TCP/IP protocol, so every host must have an IP address.\nEach IP address consists of four numbers less than 256, separated by dots. An Internet IP address is 32 bits, or 4 bytes long. It has two formats: binary and decimal. Binary is what computers understand, while decimal is \u0026rsquo;translated\u0026rsquo; from binary for easier human use and comprehension. For example, the decimal IP address 129.102.4.11 is equivalent to the binary 10000001 01100110 00000100 00001011. Clearly, the dotted-decimal format is much more convenient.\nDomain names and IP addresses have a one-to-one mapping. Domain names are easier to remember and use, hence their widespread adoption. When a user exchanges information with a computer on the Internet, they only need to use the domain name; the network automatically converts it to an IP address to locate that computer.\nInternet addresses are categorized into 5 classes: Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D, and Class E. In an IP address, all zeros represent the network, and all ones represent a broadcast.\nClass A network addresses use 1 byte (8 bits), with the highest bit set to 0 to identify this class. The remaining 7 bits form the actual network address, supporting 1 to 126 networks. The subsequent 3 bytes (24 bits) are for host addresses, providing addressing for $2^{24}-2$ endpoints.\nThe first octet of a Class A network address ranges from 000 to 127 in decimal.\nClass B network addresses use two bytes, with the highest two bits set to 10 to identify this class. The remaining 14 bits form the actual network address. Host addresses use the latter two bytes (16 bits). Thus, the total number of addresses in Class B is ($2^{14}-2$)($2^{16}-2$) = 16382 × 65534.\nThe first octet of a Class B network address ranges from 128 to 191 in decimal.\nClass C network addresses use 3 bytes and are the most common Internet addresses. The highest three bits are set to 110 to identify this class, with the remaining 21 bits forming the actual network address. Therefore, Class C supports $2^{21}-2$ networks. The last 1 byte is for host addresses, allowing up to $2^8-2$ hosts per network.\nThe first octet of a Class C network address ranges from 192 to 223 in decimal.\nClass D addresses are relatively new. Their identifier prefix is 1110, used for multicasting, for example, in router modifications.\nThe first octet of a Class D network address ranges from 224 to 239 in decimal.\nClass E addresses are reserved for experimental use, with an identifier prefix of 1111.\nThe first octet of a Class E network address ranges from 240 to 255 in decimal.\nNetwork software and routers use a Subnet Mask to determine if a packet is staying within the local network or being routed elsewhere. Within a field, a \u0026lsquo;1\u0026rsquo; indicates that portion is part of the network address, while a \u0026lsquo;0\u0026rsquo; indicates a host address position. For example, the common Class C address uses the first 3 bytes for the network ID and the last byte (8 bits) for the host ID. Hence, its subnet mask is 255.255.255.0.\nIPv6 Introduction IPv6 features a 128-bit address space, thoroughly solving the IPv4 address depletion issue. Beyond that, IPv6 also incorporates hierarchical addressing, efficient IP packet headers, Quality of Service (QoS), stateless address autoconfiguration, authentication, and encryption, among many other technologies.\n7. Windows Commands ipconfig /release: DHCP client manually releases IP address.\nipconfig /flushdns: Clears local DNS cache content.\nipconfig /displaydns: Displays local DNS content.\nipconfig /registerdns: DNS client manually registers with the server.\nipconfig: Shows IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway for all network adapters.\nipconfig /all: Displays full TCP/IP configuration info for all network adapters, including whether DHCP service is enabled.\nipconfig /renew: DHCP client manually renews its request (re-applies for an IP address) with the server.\n8. Routing Windows Server 2003 has 5 routing types. When a Windows server receives an IP packet, it first looks for host routes, then network routes (direct and remote), and if those fail, it finally looks for a default route.\nAdministrative distances for various route sources are as follows:\nIf a router receives multiple routes for a certain destination, forwarded by different routing protocols, it compares their administrative distances and uses the route information from the source with the smallest administrative distance.\n","date":"2025-03-01T23:28:30+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/236/","title":"Software Designer - Computer Networks Notes"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash This article was created and last modified between 2022.10.31 and 2024.09.15.

Prism Magic! https://blog.yexca.net/archives/260 Intro Today, I tried the December 2019 N1 test. Accidentally passed! That instantly sparked my desire to write articles about learning Japanese – thus, this series was born.\nPicking a song was a bit of a pain. Lately, I\u0026rsquo;ve been jamming to music (I usually call stuff with vocals \u0026lsquo;songs\u0026rsquo; and instrumental tracks \u0026lsquo;music\u0026rsquo;), and you can\u0026rsquo;t really write about just music, right?\nI tried checking YouTube Music for my most-played tracks each season, but nothing quite hit the \u0026rsquo;loop forever\u0026rsquo; spot (good for a single listen, but not that good). Digging through my history, I found this song.\nSpeaking of this track, it\u0026rsquo;s probably the first song where I understood most of it without looking at the lyrics (yeah, a bit contradictory, but whatever). I looped it countless times. Honestly, it\u0026rsquo;s what got me into Uruha Rushia (even though she\u0026rsquo;s no longer active). How can a song be this sweet? Absolutely love it!\nSong Video Lyrics 夢の中で君と過ごしても\nEven if I spend time with you in my dreams\nまた覚めるたび君が離れないの\nEvery time I wake up, you\u0026rsquo;re still on my mind\n退屈なベッドで1人きり\nAlone in this boring bed\nあぁ 迎えに来てよ王子様\nAh~, come pick me up, my prince\n君を知りたい 気持ちもどかしい\nI want to know you, this feeling is so frustrating\nいっそシャボン玉になって弾けたい\nI wish I could just turn into a bubble and burst\nあぁ 君が好き なんて言えない\nAh~, I like you, but I can\u0026rsquo;t say it\nたまに冷たい 君がわかんない\nSometimes you\u0026rsquo;re cold, I just don\u0026rsquo;t get you\n君の場所びゅーんと飛んでって\nZooming right to your place\nアニメみたいに2人恋に落ちて\nLike in an anime, we both fall in love\nくすぐったいくらいに君のこと\nJust thinking about you makes me tingly\n考える1人の夜がいいの\nThose nights alone, just thinking of you, are nice\nふわふわと浮かぶ甘い心\nThis sweet, fluffy heart, floating around\n頭離れない君は悪い男？\nYou\u0026rsquo;re stuck in my head, are you a bad guy?\nわからないことにもやもやして\nGetting fuzzy over things I don\u0026rsquo;t understand\n夢でも君のことを考えて\nEven in dreams, I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of you\nあぁ いじけちゃって嫌になっても 考えちゃう\nAh~, even when I\u0026rsquo;m sulking and hating it, I can\u0026rsquo;t help but think of you\nねぇ 優しかったり冷たくなったり 迷路みたい\nHey, you\u0026rsquo;re sometimes kind, sometimes cold, like a maze\nあぁ 攻略サイトも見当たらないから やり直しばかり\nAh~, can\u0026rsquo;t even find a walkthrough, so it\u0026rsquo;s just restarts, over and over\nもー知らないもんって強がり\n\u0026ldquo;Ugh, I don\u0026rsquo;t care anymore!\u0026rdquo; I bluff\nでも嫌いになんてなれるわけもない\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s no way I could actually hate you\nそう思うほど胸も痛くなる愛\nThe more I think that, the more my chest aches with this love\n私の恋のキュービットは\nMy love\u0026rsquo;s Cupid\nいつになったら現れるの\nWhen will they finally show up?\n夢の中で君と過ごしても\nEven if I spend time with you in my dreams\nまた覚めるたび君が離れないの\nEvery time I wake up, you\u0026rsquo;re still on my mind\n退屈なベッドで1人きり\nAlone in this boring bed\nあぁ 迎えに来てよ王子様\nAh~, come pick me up, my prince\n君を知りたい 気持ちもどかしい\nI want to know you, this feeling is so frustrating\nいっそシャボン玉になって弾けたい\nI wish I could just turn into a bubble and burst\nあぁ 君が好き なんて言えない\nAh~, I like you, but I can\u0026rsquo;t say it\nたまに冷たい 君がわかんない\nSometimes you\u0026rsquo;re cold, I just don\u0026rsquo;t get you\nひいふうみいよ 数えて\nOne, two, three, four, counting\n君につぎ 会える日を楽しみに眠るの\nI fall asleep, looking forward to the next day I see you\nいつでも会えるよう\nSo you\u0026rsquo;ll be smitten every time we meet\n昨日よりもかわいくなるために生きるよ\nI live to become cuter than yesterday\n気付いてくれるかな\nWill you notice me?\n君の好きなメイクにしてみたとか (どうかな？)\nLike, I tried your favorite makeup look (How\u0026rsquo;s it look?)\n少し重すぎかな\nIs it a bit too much?\n優柔不断で何も決まんないや (もう)\nSo indecisive, can\u0026rsquo;t decide anything (Ugh)\n可愛くなれるかな\nCan I become cuter?\n君の前だとチークはいらないか (ねえ ねえ)\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m with you, maybe I don\u0026rsquo;t need blush (Hey, hey)\n私と同じかな\nAre you the same as me?\nこの気持ち君も同じだといいな\nI hope you feel the same way\n夢の中で君と過ごしても\nEven if I spend time with you in my dreams\nまた覚めるたび君が離れないの\nEvery time I wake up, you\u0026rsquo;re still on my mind\n退屈なベッドで1人きり\nAlone in this boring bed\nあぁ 迎えに来てよ王子様\nAh~, come pick me up, my prince\n君を知りたい 気持ちもどかしい\nI want to know you, this feeling is so frustrating\nいっそシャボン玉になって弾けたい\nI wish I could just turn into a bubble and burst\nあぁ 君が好き なんて言えない\nAh~, I like you, but I can\u0026rsquo;t say it\nたまに冷たい 君がわかんない\nSometimes you\u0026rsquo;re cold, I just don\u0026rsquo;t get you\nふわふわな気持ちを隠しても\nEven if I try to hide these fluffy feelings\n君の眼を見るとまた零こぼれるちゃうよ\nWhen I look into your eyes, they just spillout again\n味のないケーキも君となら\nEven a tasteless cake, with you\n大好きな時間に変わってく\nTurns into my favorite time\n君を知りたい もっと知りたい\nI want to know you, know you more\n好きの2文字が口から出せない\nI can\u0026rsquo;t get those two words (\u0026ldquo;I like you\u0026rdquo;) out of my mouth\nあぁ 君が好き を隠した日々\nAh~, the days I hid \u0026ldquo;I like you\u0026rdquo;\nたまに冷たい 君も愛いとおしい\nSometimes cold, even that side of you is adorableいと\n","date":"2025-02-06T22:06:10+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/230/","title":"Sound Sensations - \"drop\""},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Musical Feelings Series Song Name Translation Link 僕が死のうと思ったのは I Once Thought About Ending It All https://blog.yexca.net/archives/214 あくあ色ぱれっと Aqua\u0026rsquo;s Palette https://blog.yexca.net/archives/219 恋の押し売り Forced Love https://blog.yexca.net/archives/220 17さいのうた 17-Year-Old\u0026rsquo;s Song This Article drop Falling in Love https://blog.yexca.net/archives/230 生きるを選んだ私へ To My Self Who Chose to Live https://blog.yexca.net/archives/239 rainy lady The Rain Hasn\u0026rsquo;t Cleared https://blog.yexca.net/archives/249 恋しくなったら手を叩こう Clap Your Hands if You Want to Fall in Love https://blog.yexca.net/archives/250 pris-magic! Pris-Magic! https://blog.yexca.net/archives/260 Introduction At first, I could only understand the part about the letter to the self. It felt like it matched where I was when I first heard it, so I kept it on repeat.\nWhen I started translating this song, and looking at my recent experiences, I realized I\u0026rsquo;m in a very similar state to what Yuika was feeling back then. My current self is just like this song: full of confusion. What kind of person will I become? What does the future look like? Where should I go?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s stay positive. Just like the lyrics say, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to accept myself, move past the confusion, and just find something I enjoy doing.\nFinally, thanks to those who encouraged me, and those who didn\u0026rsquo;t say much but supported me through their actions.\n2025.01.27 Sang this song. Didn\u0026rsquo;t take a photo because it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the original video; felt a bit meaningless. Since it mirrors my current mindset, I really felt that \u0026ldquo;lost in the future\u0026rdquo; vibe while singing. Putting it into words—or rather, singing it out—made things feel complicated, but it was a great experience.\n2025.05.26 Sang it again. Took a quick photo this time. Thinking about my own growth, it\u0026rsquo;s a truly strange and wonderful song.\nMusic Video Lyrics こんな私の未み熟じゅくなうたを　聴いてくれてどうも有難うね\nThank you for listening to such an immature song of mine.\nもう少しで私は未熟な大人に　なるみたいです\nIt seems I\u0026rsquo;ll be becoming an immature adult very soon.\nなんか笑っちゃうね\nIt\u0026rsquo;s kind of funny, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\n本当はね\nTo tell you the truth,\nもっと前を向けるようなうたを　書くつもりだったけど\nI intended to write a song that was more forward-looking.\n書けなくて\nBut I couldn\u0026rsquo;t write it.\n私はまだ　他の誰かを支えられるほど\nI\u0026rsquo;m not yet at the point where I can support someone else.\n強くなかったみたい　ごめんね\nI guess I wasn\u0026rsquo;t that strong. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry.\n拝啓　未来の私へ　今そこで\nDear future me, right there,\nどんなことをして　生きていますか\nWhat are you doing? How are you living?\n拝啓　今の私へ　今ここで\nDear present me, right here,\nどんなことをしたら　生きていけるんでしょうか\nWhat should I do to keep on living?\n\u0026ldquo;好きだからかっこいい\u0026quot;とか　\u0026ldquo;そばにいる\u0026quot;とか\nI once wrote things like \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re cool because I like you\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll be by your side.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;勝手に盗んだ\u0026quot;とか　書いてた\nOr \u0026ldquo;I stole your heart without permission.\u0026rdquo;\nどうせだったらもうちょっと　貴方みたいに\nIf that\u0026rsquo;s the case, I should have written a song\nやさしいうたを書けばよかったね\nAs kind as you are.\n本当はね　好きなことだけして生きたいの\nThe truth is, I just want to live doing the things I love.\nでもそれは上手な生き方とは言えないから\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s not exactly what you\u0026rsquo;d call a \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; way to live.\n無駄になっても　意味がなくても\nEven if it\u0026rsquo;s in vain, even if it\u0026rsquo;s meaningless,\n今はここから　離れなきゃいけないの　ごめんね\nI have to leave this place now. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry.\n拝啓　未来の私へ　今そこで\nDear future me, right there,\nどんな大人になって　生きていますか\nWhat kind of adult have you become? How are you living?\n拝啓　今の私へ　今ここで\nDear present me, right here,\nどんな大人になりたいと　言えばいいんでしょうか\nWhat kind of adult should I say I want to become?\n「さよなら」は悲しくなるからさ\n\u0026ldquo;Goodbye\u0026rdquo; makes things too sad.\n「またね」って言わせて\nSo let me say, \u0026ldquo;See you later.\u0026rdquo;\nいつか私が　今みたいな　うたを書けなくなっても\nEven if someday I can no longer write songs like this one,\n怒らないでね\nPlease don\u0026rsquo;t be angry with me.\n拝啓　過去の私へ　今の私は\nDear past me, my current self\nずっと夢見ていたこと叶えてるよ\nIs fulfilling the dreams we always had.\n拝啓　今の私へ\nDear present me,\nこんな情なさけない　うただって歌えばいいよ\nIt\u0026rsquo;s okay to sing a song as pathetic as this.\nそれが私だから\nBecause that\u0026rsquo;s who I am.\n拝啓　未来の私へ　今そこは\nDear future me, right there,\nどんな綺麗な世界が　広がっていますか\nWhat kind of beautiful world is unfolding before you?\n拝啓　今の私へ　今ここが\nDear present me, right here and now,\nどんな世界よりも　幸せでした\nI was happier than in any other world.\nこんな私の未熟なうたを　聴いてくれてどうも有難うね\nThank you for listening to such an immature song of mine.\nこれから私は未熟な大人に　なる準備をします\nFrom now on, I\u0026rsquo;ll start preparing to become an immature adult.\n「じゃあ またね」\n\u0026ldquo;Well then, see you later.\u0026rdquo;\n","date":"2025-01-25T16:57:49+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/224/","title":"Musical Feelings - \"17-sai no Uta\""},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash Configuration You can configure things using YAML, YML, or properties files. Java system properties and command-line arguments also work.\nPriority: Command Line Args \u0026gt; Java System Properties \u0026gt; Properties Files \u0026gt; YML \u0026gt; YAML\nFor command line usage, first run the Maven package command, then execute from the command line:\n1 2 3 4 5 java -jar path_to_jar.jar # Java System Property, e.g., for port java -Dserver.port=9000 -jar path_to_jar.jar # Command Line Argument, e.g., for port java -jar path_to_jar.jar --server.port=9000 When packaging a SpringBoot project, you need the spring-boot-maven-plugin. (If you create a project from the official skeleton, this plugin is automatically included).\nBean Management Getting Beans For default singleton, non-lazy-loaded beans, Spring creates them all during startup and puts them in the IOC container. (If you use @Lazy, they\u0026rsquo;ll be instantiated on first use).\nIf you want to explicitly get these beans, you can do it like this:\nGet by name: 1 Object getBean(String name) Get by type: 1 \u0026lt;T\u0026gt; T getBean(Class\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; requiredType) Get by name and type (type conversion): 1 \u0026lt;T\u0026gt; T getBean(String name, Class\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; requiredType) To use this method, you first need to get the IOC container object:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 @Autowired private ApplicationContext applicationContext; //IOC container object public void testGetBean(){ // Get by bean name DeptController beanl = (DeptController) applicationContext.getBean(\u0026#34;deptController\u0026#34;); // Get by bean type DeptController bean2 = applicationContext.getBean(DeptController.class); // Get by bean name and type DeptController bean3 = applicationContext.getBean(\u0026#34;deptController\u0026#34;, DeptController.class); } Bean Scopes Spring supports five scopes. The last three are only active in a web environment.\nScope Description singleton Only one instance of the bean exists per container (singleton) prototype A new instance is created each time the bean is used (non-singleton) request A new instance is created for each request session A new instance is created for each session application A new instance is created for each application Use the @Scope annotation to set the scope:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 // Set to non-singleton @Scope(\u0026#34;prototype\u0026#34;) @RestController public class xxxController{ } In real-world development, most beans are singletons, meaning most beans don\u0026rsquo;t need the scope attribute configured.\nThird-Party Beans If the bean you want to manage comes from a third party (not custom-defined), you can\u0026rsquo;t use @Component or its derivatives. Instead, you\u0026rsquo;ll need the @Bean annotation. A good example is dom4j for parsing XML files.\n1 2 3 4 5 \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.dom4j\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;dom4j\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;2.1.3\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; Dependency as above.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 @SpringBootApplication public class xxxApplication{ @Bean // Hand the method\u0026#39;s return value to the IOC container to become an IOC bean public SAXReader saxReader(){ return new SAXReader(); } } However, for third-party beans, it\u0026rsquo;s a good practice to centralize their configuration. You can declare a configuration class using the @Configuration annotation.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 @Configuration public class CommonConfig { @Bean public SAXReader saxReader(){ return new SAXReader(); } } You can specify a bean\u0026rsquo;s name using the name or value attribute of the @Bean annotation. If not specified, the method name becomes the bean name by default. If a third-party bean depends on other beans, just declare them as method parameters in the bean definition method, and the container will autowire them by type.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 @Configuration public class CommonConfig { @Bean public SAXReader saxReader(XxService xxService){ return new SAXReader(); } } Starter Dependencies When developing directly with Spring, you need to pull in a bunch of dependencies and ensure version compatibility. With SpringBoot, you just need to include a \u0026lsquo;starter\u0026rsquo; dependency. The magic behind it is Maven\u0026rsquo;s transitive dependencies; all other required dependencies are automatically pulled in.\nAuto-Configuration SpringBoot\u0026rsquo;s auto-configuration means that when the Spring container starts, various configuration classes and bean objects are automatically added to the IOC container. This eliminates manual declarations, simplifying development and cutting down on tedious configuration.\nAt its core, a configuration class (@Configuration) is a @Component and thus also a bean in the container.\nSo, after pulling in a dependency, how do the configuration classes and beans defined within that JAR get loaded into the Spring IOC container?\n@ComponentScan You can use @ComponentScan to specify which packages to scan. For example, if you imported com.example.\n1 2 @SpringBootApplication @ComponentScan({\u0026#34;net.yexca\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;com.example\u0026#34;}) However, if you\u0026rsquo;re pulling in many third-party dependencies, you\u0026rsquo;d have to list a lot of packages above, and large-scale scanning can impact performance.\n@Import You can import regular classes, configuration classes, and ImportSelector interface implementations.\nRegular Classes 1 2 @Import(TokenParser.class) // Import a regular class @SpringBootApplication Configuration Classes Configuration class content:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 @Configuration public class HeaderConfig { @Bean public HeaderParser headerParser(){ return new HeaderParser(); } @Bean public HeaderGenerator headerGenerator(){ return new HeaderGenerator(); } } Startup class:\n1 2 @Import(HeaderConfig.class) // Import a configuration class @SpringBootApplication ImportSelector Implementations ImportSelector interface implementation content:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 public class MyImportSelector implements ImportSelector { public String[] selectImports(AnnotationMetadata importingClassMetadata) { // Returns a string array (array containing fully qualified class names) return new String[]{\u0026#34;com.example.HeaderConfig\u0026#34;}; } } Startup class:\n1 2 @Import(MyImportSelector.class) // Import an ImportSelector implementation class @SpringBootApplication @EnableXxxxx The @Import approach above requires you to first know exactly which config classes or beans are in the third-party dependency. Instead, third-party dependencies can offer @EnableXxxxx annotations. These encapsulate @Import to provide common beans, so you just need to use @EnableXxxxx.\nFor instance, let\u0026rsquo;s wrap the previous @Import config class with an @EnableHeaderConfig annotation:\n1 2 3 4 5 @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target(ElementType.TYPE) @Import(MyImportSelector.class)// Specify which bean objects or config classes to import public @interface EnableHeaderConfig { } Then, simply add the @EnableHeaderConfig annotation to your startup class to import the relevant beans.\n1 2 @EnableHeaderConfig // Use the Enable-prefixed annotation provided by the third-party dependency @SpringBootApplication This is also the approach SpringBoot itself uses.\nSpringBoot\u0026rsquo;s Auto-Configuration Inside the @SpringBootApplication annotation, you\u0026rsquo;ll find @EnableAutoConfiguration. This, in turn, @Imports AutoConfigurationImportSelector.class, an implementation of the ImportSelector interface.\nThe selectImports() method is overridden in this implementation class:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 public String[] selectImports(AnnotationMetadata annotationMetadata) { if (!this.isEnabled(annotationMetadata)) { return NO_IMPORTS; } else { // Get the collection of auto-configuration class info AutoConfigurationEntry autoConfigurationEntry = this.getAutoConfigurationEntry(annotationMetadata); return StringUtils.toStringArray(autoConfigurationEntry.getConfigurations()); } } It calls getAutoConfigurationEntry() to fetch the collection of auto-configuration class info:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 protected AutoConfigurationEntry getAutoConfigurationEntry(AnnotationMetadata annotationMetadata) { if (!this.isEnabled(annotationMetadata)) { return EMPTY_ENTRY; } else { AnnotationAttributes attributes = this.getAttributes(annotationMetadata); // Get the collection of all auto-configuration classes configured in the properties file List\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; configurations = this.getCandidateConfigurations(annotationMetadata, attributes); configurations = this.removeDuplicates(configurations); Set\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; exclusions = this.getExclusions(annotationMetadata, attributes); this.checkExcludedClasses(configurations, exclusions); configurations.removeAll(exclusions); configurations = this.getConfigurationClassFilter().filter(configurations); this.fireAutoConfigurationImportEvents(configurations, exclusions); return new AutoConfigurationEntry(configurations, exclusions); } } Specifically, the getCandidateConfigurations(annotationMetadata, attributes) method retrieves all auto-configuration classes configured in the properties files:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 protected List\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; getCandidateConfigurations(AnnotationMetadata metadata, AnnotationAttributes attributes) { List\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; configurations = new ArrayList(SpringFactoriesLoader.loadFactoryNames(this.getSpringFactoriesLoaderFactoryClass(), this.getBeanClassLoader())); ImportCandidates.load(AutoConfiguration.class, this.getBeanClassLoader()).forEach(configurations::add); Assert.notEmpty(configurations, \u0026#34;No auto configuration classes found in META-INF/spring.factories nor in META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports. If you are using a custom packaging, make sure that file is correct.\u0026#34;); return configurations; } As you can see, it fetches the collection of configuration classes from META-INF/spring.factories and META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports files.\nThese two files are typically found within the starter dependencies you include.\nSo, when a SpringBoot application starts, it loads the configuration classes defined in these files. These configuration class details (fully qualified names) are then encapsulated into a String array, and finally, all these configuration classes are loaded into Spring\u0026rsquo;s IOC container via the @Import annotation, managed by the IOC container.\n@Conditional With so many configuration classes, will every single bean be registered in the IOC container? Nope. The @Conditional annotation allows bean objects to be wired based on specific conditions.\n@Conditional is a parent annotation with many sub-annotations.\n@ConditionalOnClass Registers the bean into the IOC container ONLY if the corresponding bytecode file exists in the environment.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 @Configuration public class HeaderConfig { @Bean // The bean is added to the IOC container only if the specified class exists in the environment @ConditionalOnClass(name=\u0026#34;io.jsonwebtoken.Jwts\u0026#34;) public HeaderParser headerParser(){ return new HeaderParser(); } } The bean above will only be injected into the IOC container if the JWT token dependency is present.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 \u0026lt;!--JWT Token--\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;io.jsonwebtoken\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;jjwt\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;0.9.1\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; Testing:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 @SpringBootTest public class AutoConfigurationTests { @Autowired private ApplicationContext applicationContext; @Test public void testHeaderParser(){ System.out.println(applicationContext.getBean(HeaderParser.class)); } } @ConditionalOnMissingBean Registers the bean into the IOC container ONLY if there\u0026rsquo;s no corresponding bean (by type or name) in the environment.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 @Configuration public class HeaderConfig { @Bean @ConditionalOnMissingBean // The bean is added to the IOC container only if a bean of this type does not exist public HeaderParser headerParser(){ return new HeaderParser(); } } The above will create the bean only if there isn\u0026rsquo;t already a HeaderConfig type bean in the IOC container.\nYou can also specify another bean\u0026rsquo;s name in the annotation:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 @Configuration public class HeaderConfig { @Bean // The bean is added to the IOC container only if a bean with the specified name does not exist @ConditionalOnMissingBean(name=\u0026#34;deptController2\u0026#34;) public HeaderParser headerParser(){ return new HeaderParser(); } } In the example above, the HeaderConfig object will only be registered into the IOC if a bean named deptController2 doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist.\nYou can also specify a type:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 @Configuration public class HeaderConfig { @Bean // The bean is added to the IOC container only if a bean of the specified type does not exist @ConditionalOnMissingBean(HeaderConfig.class) public HeaderParser headerParser(){ return new HeaderParser(); } } Running the example above and trying to call this bean would throw a NoSuchBeanDefinitionException.

The autoconfigure module: This is where auto-configuration logic resides. Once these two modules are set up, other projects just need to include the starter dependency, and the autoconfigure module will be transitively pulled in.\nModule POM Files aliyun-oss-spring-boot-starter Module:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 \u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34;

Spring AOP is an advanced Spring framework tech, primarily using the underlying dynamic proxy mechanism to program specific methods while managing bean objects.\nCounting Method Execution Time Importing Dependencies 1 2 3 4 \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.boot\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-boot-starter-aop\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; Writing AOP Code Write AOP code to program specific methods based on business needs.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 @Slf4j @Component @Aspect // AOP Class public class TimeAspect { // Pointcut expression @Around(\u0026#34;execution(* net.yexca.service.*.*(..))\u0026#34;) public Object recordTime(ProceedingJoinPoint proceedingJoinPoint) throws Throwable { long begin = System.currentTimeMillis(); // Call the original method Object object = proceedingJoinPoint.proceed(); long end = System.currentTimeMillis(); log.info(proceedingJoinPoint.getSignature() + \u0026#34; method execution time: {}ms\u0026#34;, end-begin); return object; } } Common AOP use cases include logging operations, access control, and transaction management.\nCore Concepts Join Point: A method that can be controlled by AOP (implicitly contains execution-related info).\nAdvice: Refers to the repetitive logic, or common functionality (ultimately implemented as a method).\nPointcut: Conditions for matching join points. Advice is applied only when a pointcut method executes.\nAspect: Describes the relationship between advice and pointcut (Advice + Pointcut).\nTarget Object: The object to which the advice is applied.\nIn the example above, all methods of the unwritten Service are join points. Methods selected by the pointcut expression are pointcuts. The recordTime method in the AOP class is the advice. The @Around annotation combined with the advice forms an aspect, and the TimeAspect class is called the aspect class.\nAdvice Advice Types @Around: Around advice. The advice method annotated with this executes both before and after the target method.\n@Before: Before advice. The advice method annotated with this executes before the target method.\n@After: After (finally) advice. The advice method annotated with this executes after the target method, regardless of whether an exception occurred.\n@AfterReturning: After returning advice. The advice method annotated with this executes after the target method returns normally (no exception).\n@AfterThrowing: After throwing advice. The advice method annotated with this executes if the target method throws an exception.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 @Component @Aspect public class MyAspect { @Before(\u0026#34;execution(* net.yexca.service.impl.*(..))\u0026#34;) public void before(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;Before\u0026#34;); } @Around(\u0026#34;execution(* net.yexca.service.impl.*(..))\u0026#34;) public Object around(ProceedingJoinPoint proceedingJoinPoint) throws Throwable { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Around before\u0026#34;); Object result = proceedingJoinPoint.proceed(); System.out.println(\u0026#34;Around after\u0026#34;); return result; } @After(\u0026#34;execution(* net.yexca.service.impl.*(..))\u0026#34;) public void after(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;After\u0026#34;); } @AfterReturning(\u0026#34;execution(* net.yexca.service.impl.*(..))\u0026#34;) public void afterRetruning(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;AfterReturning\u0026#34;); } @AfterThrowing(\u0026#34;execution(* net.yexca.service.impl.*(..))\u0026#34;) public void afterThrowing(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;AfterThrowing\u0026#34;); } } @Around advice needs to manually call ProceedingJoinPoint.proceed() for the original method to execute. Other advice types don\u0026rsquo;t need to consider target method execution.\nThe return type of an @Around advice method must be Object to receive the return value of the original method.\nThe pointcut expressions for the 5 annotations above are identical and can be extracted, as shown below:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 public class MyAspect { @Pointcut(\u0026#34;execution(* net.yexca.service.impl.*(..))\u0026#34;) public void pt(){} @Before(\u0026#34;pt()\u0026#34;) public void before(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;Before\u0026#34;); } } If the pt() method has public access, it can be referenced in other classes.\nAdvice Order When multiple aspects\u0026rsquo; pointcuts match the same target method, multiple advice methods will execute when the target method runs.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 net: yexca: aop: - MyAspect1 - MyAspect2 - MyAspect3 Suppose three AOP classes all select the same method. Among different aspect classes, the default order is alphabetical by aspect class name.\nAdvice methods before the target method: those with earlier alphabetical ranking execute first. Advice methods after the target method: those with later alphabetical ranking execute first. Assuming three AOP classes have both @Before and @After, the execution order is:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 MyAspect1 before MyAspect2 before MyAspect3 before MyAspect3 after MyAspect2 after MyAspect1 after You can use the @Order(num) annotation on the aspect class to control the order. A smaller num means earlier execution. The execution order for @Before and @After remains the same as described above.\nPointcut Expressions An expression describing pointcut methods, primarily used to determine which methods in a project need advice.\nCommon forms include execution(...) which matches based on method signatures, and annotation which matches based on annotations.\nexecution Mainly matches based on method return type, package name, class name, method name, method parameters, etc. The syntax is:\n1 execution(AccessModifier ReturnType PackageName.ClassName.MethodName(MethodParameters) throws Exception) The AccessModifier, PackageName.ClassName, and throws Exception can be omitted, but it\u0026rsquo;s not recommended to omit PackageName.ClassName.\nWildcards can also be used to describe pointcuts:\n*: A single arbitrary character. Can match any return type, package name, class name, method name, any single parameter type, or part of a package, class, or method name. 1 execution(* com.*.service.*.update*(*)) ..: Multiple consecutive arbitrary characters. Can match any level of package, or any type and number of parameters. 1 execution(* com.yexca..service.*(..)) You can also use \u0026amp;\u0026amp;, ||, ! to combine more complex pointcut expressions.\nWriting Suggestions Standardize all business method names as much as possible for easier pointcut expression matching. Describe pointcut methods usually based on interfaces rather than concrete implementations, enhancing extensibility. Narrow the pointcut matching scope as much as possible while still meeting business requirements. @annotation The @annotation pointcut expression is used to match methods marked with a specific annotation. You need to define a custom annotation first.\n1 2 3 4 @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target(ElementType.METHOD) public @interface MyLog { } Then add this annotation to the method, and in the AOP class method, use:\n1 @Before(\u0026#34;@annotation(net.yexca.aop.MyLog)\u0026#34;) Join Point In Spring, JoinPoint abstracts the concept of a join point. It allows you to obtain information related to method execution.\nFor @Around advice, you must use ProceedingJoinPoint to get join point info. For the other four advice types, you must use JoinPoint to get join point info; it\u0026rsquo;s the parent class of ProceedingJoinPoint. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 public Object recordTime(ProceedingJoinPoint proceedingJoinPoint) throws Throwable { // Get the target object\u0026#39;s class name String className = proceedingJoinPoint.getTarget().getClass().getName(); // Get the target method\u0026#39;s name String methodNAme = proceedingJoinPoint.getSignature().getName(); // Get the parameters passed during target method execution Object[] args = proceedingJoinPoint.getArgs(); // Call the original method Object object = proceedingJoinPoint.proceed(); return object; } ","date":"2025-01-21T16:05:57+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/221/","title":"Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash Sound Impressions Series Song Title Translation Link 僕が死のうと思ったのは I Wanted to Die https://blog.yexca.net/archives/214 あくあ色ぱれっと Aqua-colored Palette https://blog.yexca.net/archives/219 恋の押し売り Love\u0026rsquo;s Hard Sell This Article 17さいのうた 17-Year-Old\u0026rsquo;s Song https://blog.yexca.net/archives/224 drop Drop https://blog.yexca.net/archives/230 生きるを選んだ私へ To the Me Who Chose to Live https://blog.yexca.net/archives/239 rainy lady Rainy Lady https://blog.yexca.net/archives/249 恋しくなったら手を叩こう If You Get Lonely, Clap Your Hands https://blog.yexca.net/archives/250 pris-magic!

When I opened it up, the screen showed \u0026ldquo;今年もお届けします。2024 年のハイライト！\u0026rdquo; (Here\u0026rsquo;s your delivery for this year. 2024 Highlights!), and then it auto-played this track: \u0026ldquo;ハートマーク作って、届け届け届け！\u0026rdquo; (Make a heart mark, deliver, deliver, deliver!). Talk about maxing out the user experience, right?\n2025.01.27 I sang this song, it\u0026rsquo;s just too cute!!!\nSong Video Bilibili\u0026rsquo;s embed experience isn\u0026rsquo;t great, so I\u0026rsquo;m using YouTube.

Prism Magic! https://blog.yexca.net/archives/260 Intro My initial pick for the second song was my 2024 Song of the Year. But then an Aqua song came on, and this one clicked. I\u0026rsquo;d been listening to it because a middle section kind of mirrored my own life. After a deep dive into the translation, it hit me: this is the origin of the \u0026ldquo;dyed in Aqua\u0026rsquo;s colors\u0026rdquo; meme! (I heard \u0026ldquo;want to be dyed in Aqua\u0026rsquo;s colors\u0026rdquo; at C105 and actually thought it was from \u0026lsquo;Kimi-iro ni Somaru\u0026rsquo;).\nWhile thinking about the fourth song, I realized this one was actually my 2023 Song of the Year. No biggie, let\u0026rsquo;s just kick things off with my YouTube history — consider it my first \u0026lsquo;Song of the Year\u0026rsquo;.\nThough similar experiences got me listening to and slowly liking Aqua, honestly, my \u0026ldquo;Because you\u0026rsquo;re here, I can always do my best\u0026rdquo; moment actually came from Warma. Writing this, I suddenly realized what truly influenced me, and why things are the way they are now. But just like how this song brought change, my current confusion will definitely find a way to resolve itself.\nI held back from elaborating further; it\u0026rsquo;s a joyful track. For an idol, this song is pure fire, absolutely perfect for that path. Plus, the lyrics aren\u0026rsquo;t too complex (for non-native speakers), even I can get them (doge).\nI only got into Aqua last year (2024). Hearing this song constantly (during 3D streams), I figured it came after she’d built up some experience, a powerhouse track that just topped the charts. Turns out, it was a debut peak! (\u0026lsquo;For the Win\u0026rsquo; was a Bilibili project, so I\u0026rsquo;ll skip that one for now.) All her subsequent idol-style songs were great, actually got me into that whole idol vibe. It even got me into idol concerts (though I\u0026rsquo;m less keen now after Aqua\u0026rsquo;s graduation).\nAlso, my translations might differ from others because I often inject my own feelings. So some parts aren\u0026rsquo;t a direct literal translation of the lyrics (same deal with the previous song ). This\u0026rsquo;ll be even clearer in the translation for my possibly next 2024 Song of the Year. Just copying a standard translation feels kinda pointless; when it\u0026rsquo;s something I truly love, I want to leave my own mark (dye it my color).\nAnyway, I also want to be dyed in Aqua\u0026rsquo;s colors! She\u0026rsquo;s one of my top three favorites, after all ~~ (Sucks I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get her standee at C105, or Yuuki\u0026rsquo;s either 😭)~~.\n2025.01.27 Sang this song. While singing, I thought of Aqua\u0026rsquo;s cover of Prideful Idol . It was a pretty unique experience. 2025.05.26 Sang it again (though I did sing it once in VRChat before). Still love \u0026lsquo;Because you\u0026rsquo;re here, I could walk this far; without you, I can\u0026rsquo;t even see what\u0026rsquo;s ahead.\u0026rsquo; It\u0026rsquo;s truly energizing when you\u0026rsquo;re feeling down and find someone who inspires you, or a goal you really want to achieve.\nSong Video Bilibili\u0026rsquo;s embed experience isn\u0026rsquo;t great, so I\u0026rsquo;ve switched to YouTube.

Later, if you add an SMS service or a loyalty points service, you\u0026rsquo;d have to modify the payment code each time. This violates the Open/Closed Principle . Plus, you can\u0026rsquo;t do anything else until the request returns, which wastes performance.\nProblems: High coupling, performance degradation, resource waste, cascading failures (if a provider service goes down, all calling services fail too, like dominoes, quickly bringing down the entire microservice cluster).\nAsynchronous Call Solutions Asynchronous calls are often implemented using an event-driven pattern.\nUser payment request -\u0026gt; Payment Service -\u0026gt; Broker. The payment service then completes and responds, and the Broker notifies the order service, warehouse service, and SMS service.\nPros: Service decoupling, improved performance and throughput, loose coupling (fault isolation), traffic shaping/spike reduction.\nCons: Relies on the Broker\u0026rsquo;s reliability, security, and throughput. The architecture becomes more complex, business flows aren\u0026rsquo;t always clear, and tracing/management can be harder.\nMQ Message Queue. Literally, a queue for messages.

Message received: 【hello, rabbitmq!】 Clearly, this approach is a bit cumbersome.\nSpringAMQP SpringAMQP is a template wrapper around RabbitMQ. It also leverages Spring Boot for auto-configuration, making it super convenient to use.\nAMQP Advanced Message Queuing Protocol, an open standard for passing business messages between applications. This protocol is language and platform-agnostic, which aligns well with microservices\u0026rsquo; independence requirements.\nSpring AMQP Spring AMQP defines a set of APIs based on the AMQP protocol, providing templates for sending and receiving messages. It includes two parts: spring-amqp for basic abstractions, and spring-rabbit as the default underlying implementation.\nIt can automatically declare queues, exchanges, and their bindings, and supports annotation-based listener patterns for asynchronous message reception.\nBasic Queue Model First, add the dependency in your parent project:\n1 2 3 4 5 \u0026lt;!--AMQP dependency, includes RabbitMQ--\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.boot\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-boot-starter-amqp\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; Publisher (Sending Messages) Configure application.yml:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 spring: rabbitmq: host: localhost # Hostname port: 5672 # Port virtual-host: / # Virtual host username: admin # Username password: admin # Password Use RabbitTemplate to send messages:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 @RunWith(SpringRunner.class) @SpringBootTest public class SpringamqpTest { @Autowired private RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate; @Test public void testSimpleQueue(){ // Queue name String queueName = \u0026#34;hello.queue\u0026#34;; // Message String msg = \u0026#34;Hello Spring ampq\u0026#34;; // Send rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend(queueName,msg); } } Consumer (Receiving Messages) Same application.yml config as above.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 spring: rabbitmq: host: localhost # Hostname port: 5672 # Port virtual-host: / # Virtual host username: admin # Username password: admin # Password Create a new SpringRabbitListener class:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 @Component public class SpringRabbitListener { @RabbitListener(queues = \u0026#34;hello.queue\u0026#34;) public void listenSimpleQueue(String msg){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;Received message: \u0026#34; + msg); } } Work Queues (Task Queues) Also known as Task Queues.

This means messages are evenly distributed among consumers, without considering their processing capacity. Clearly, that\u0026rsquo;s an issue.\nPrefetch Modify application.yml to set the prefetch value, which controls the prefetch message limit (default is unlimited).\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 spring: rabbitmq: host: localhost # Hostname port: 5672 # Port virtual-host: / # Virtual host username: admin # Username password: admin # Password listener: simple: # Only fetches one message at a time; must process it before fetching the next prefetch: 1 Retesting shows improved execution efficiency.\nPublish/Subscribe Model The Publish/Subscribe model adds an exchange, allowing the same message to be sent to all subscribers.\npublisher -\u0026gt; exchange -\u0026gt; queue1 and queue2 queue1 -\u0026gt; consumer1 and consumer2 queue2 -\u0026gt; consumer3\nCommon exchanges include:\nFanout: Broadcast Direct: Routing Topic: Topic Exchanges route messages but don\u0026rsquo;t store them.

It’s a 2024 summary, but also a record of my thoughts and journey over the past few years. My writing isn\u0026rsquo;t the most polished, and I have a lot I want to say but don\u0026rsquo;t quite know how to synthesize it all. So, here it is.\nMy Journey from 2020 to 2024 Since 2020, I\u0026rsquo;ve felt time accelerating. Even though I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced a lot, I haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to recapture that pre-2020 feeling—the sense that I was living each day intentionally or that time was a vast resource. However, looking at it objectively, I\u0026rsquo;ve done a lot every year. This year, in particular, was packed.\n2020 Took my college entrance exams this year, then kicked off my first experience living away from home. Joined some clubs at uni and got involved in a ton of activities. 2021 Spent the first half of the year busy with club stuff. In the second half, I switched over to the Apple ecosystem, changed my major, and set up this blog. 2022 Paid a premium to get the Switch OLED right when it dropped and had a blast playing it. Bought a Quest 2 the same year to start my VR journey and wrote some VRChat tutorials. Also took a trip to Nanjing at the end of the year. 2023 Moved to a new campus this year. Started going to some ACG events, like the Genshin Impact collabs with Pizza Hut and Hey Tea. After campus restrictions were lifted later on, I explored the surrounding areas a bit. Took the Soft Exam (software qualification) and JLPT, bought a Google Pixel 6, and got hooked on collecting credit cards. 2024 Probably my most exciting year yet. Started the year interning in Shenzhen—checked out the new Costco there, saw the ocean for the first time, met so many awesome people, explored Huaqiangbei, and visited Hong Kong and Macau (plus my first boat ride!). My mindset really shifted too; after graduating and moving home, my attitude toward others changed, and I started connecting more with my family. We went to Xuzhou together. I also started cooking, DIY-ing stuff, and got my driver's license. After all that, I went to Japan—my first time flying, first time wearing anime gear in public, and my first time attending Comiket (C105)! The volume of events seems to increase every year, yet my subjective feeling remains: \u0026ldquo;Time is flying, and I haven\u0026rsquo;t really done anything.\u0026rdquo; This paradox confuses me.\nTheoretical Explanations for Life Note: These theories are purely personal conjecture, unverified and unanalyzed. Proceed with skepticism.\nIn the second half of 2023, while I was supposed to be prepping for post-grad exams, I suffered from severe eye pain. I could barely keep my eyes open for more than four hours a day. During that time, drifting in and out of sleep, I developed a theory to explain life. I became obsessed with \u0026ldquo;explaining\u0026rdquo; existence.\nState Behavior Theory I even named these ideas. The first was \u0026ldquo;State Behavior Theory.\u0026rdquo; I treated all factors influencing human behavior as quantifiable variables (emotions, information access, past experiences, environmental factors). Each variable has a weight. If you could capture enough variables, you could predict a person\u0026rsquo;s behavior with high accuracy. Extrapolating this: if you knew every variable for every person, life would be deterministic.\nThe theory didn\u0026rsquo;t start this way. It began as a few days of daydreaming until I realized it mapped almost perfectly to \u0026ldquo;State Behaviors\u0026rdquo; in Unity. That\u0026rsquo;s where the name came from. After analyzing more situations, it evolved into its current form.\nCircle Theory To help identify specific variables, I came up with \u0026ldquo;Circle Theory\u0026rdquo; to describe social influence. This grew from my observations of the internet. As I shifted from deep diving into single topics to a broader exploration of many, I noticed a strange phenomenon: internet populations are divided into \u0026ldquo;circles\u0026rdquo; based on interests. Each circle has its own self-consistent logic. Things that are shocking to the outside world are mundane inside the circle, and vice versa. There are also opposing circles—one claims X is good and everything else is bad, while the other claims the exact opposite. Circles aren\u0026rsquo;t isolated; they can be grouped into sets, where the behavior of the set represents the behavior of its subsets.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s similar to the concept of \u0026ldquo;information cocoons\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;echo chambers,\u0026rdquo; where people see what they want to see. Because the world is so populated, you can always find people who agree with you, reinforcing your views until you have a perfectly self-contained explanation for everything.\nOf course, these are just base conclusions. To explain a complex world, you need derivations and auxiliary theories.\nExplaining Famous Quotes For example, why do famous quotes often feel so profound? Based on State Behavior Theory (or a generalized theory of everything), we can assume things in the world share a \u0026ldquo;root parent class.\u0026rdquo; This root evolves into subclasses, which then evolve into abstract classes. When someone experiences something that is essentially an implementation of an abstract class, they summarize it into a quote. When we have a different experience that implements the same abstract class, the quote feels deeply resonant.\nMore rigorously: human history is so well-recorded that almost every possible choice has been made before (maybe not the exact event, but the abstraction of it). Therefore, you can find support or cautionary tales for literally anything. I don\u0026rsquo;t believe in absolute rights or wrongs; things are just relatively right or wrong within specific states or contexts.\nTrust Interpretation Theory Another one I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about lately is Trust Interpretation Theory. I believe the world runs on trust. When I cross the street, I trust the driver won\u0026rsquo;t suddenly hit me. When I walk past a stranger, I trust they won\u0026rsquo;t pull out a knife. These are common, habitual actions built on a foundation of generalized trust.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve considered many other theories over the last 18 months, but I\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten most of them.\nThe Gap Between Theory and Practice Occasionally, I wonder: if I could just do what I want as freely as a child, would I feel more free? But then I realize that child was buried long ago under the soil of rules.\nEven though I could \u0026ldquo;explain\u0026rdquo; my life problems, it didn\u0026rsquo;t help me live through them. In fact, it started having negative effects.\nAs my explanations grew, I slowly realized I was too immersed in the \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; and forgot that life is the \u0026ldquo;result.\u0026rdquo; I was constantly thinking about which choice would produce which output. While planning for every possibility makes for a smoother experience, it also makes life feel like a game where you\u0026rsquo;re skipping NPC dialogue. You\u0026rsquo;re just waiting for people to say the lines you\u0026rsquo;ve already anticipated so you can pick the response you\u0026rsquo;ve already analyzed. Life becomes boring.\nI tried to distract myself with entertainment: walking, shopping, running, traveling, gaming. But despite having the freedom to choose, I felt chained. Even leisure felt like a task—a way to achieve \u0026ldquo;numerical balance\u0026rdquo; in my psyche rather than actual joy. My life became a simulation game. When stressed, I followed the \u0026ldquo;rule\u0026rdquo; of \u0026ldquo;schedule entertainment to lower stress.\u0026rdquo; I quantified my life: this event caused X stress, so I need Y activity to reduce it. These activities weren\u0026rsquo;t things I truly enjoyed; they were just \u0026ldquo;stress relief\u0026rdquo; protocols that are generally considered effective. I felt like a child who is \u0026ldquo;scheduled\u0026rdquo; to play—they are going through the motions, but their heart isn\u0026rsquo;t in it.\nI am the designer and the executor of my own life. I’m following a script I wrote myself just to finish the task, but I\u0026rsquo;ve lost the emotional connection.\nI felt like I was living under a set of invisible chains. I had to follow specific rules; anything else was \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;wrong.\u0026rdquo; Or perhaps I was seeking validation—if I do X, I\u0026rsquo;ll be accepted; if I do Y, I won\u0026rsquo;t.\nIs this just another \u0026ldquo;Circle Theory\u0026rdquo; trap? Is my explanation of the world just part of another explanation? It\u0026rsquo;s like I see the world as points on an axis, and I\u0026rsquo;ve drawn the axis to explain them, but I myself am still trapped within the 2D coordinate system.\nSince Bilibili\u0026rsquo;s embedding is poor, I\u0026rsquo;ve linked the YouTube version. Kano has an official account. Bilibili ID: BV1zr4y1n7sM\nI suspected I was depressed. I even planned how I might end it. Writing this, I\u0026rsquo;m reminded of a lyric from Boku ga Shinou to Omotta no wa (I Thought About Ending It All): \u0026ldquo;The reason I think about death so much is because I\u0026rsquo;m probably too serious about living.\u0026rdquo; Exactly. Was I taking life too seriously?\nOther parts of that song resonate too. \u0026ldquo;Today is just like yesterday.\u0026rdquo; Even if the events are different, my logic for processing them remains the same. The theory doesn\u0026rsquo;t change, so life doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like it changes.\n\u0026ldquo;Fighting an invisible enemy.\u0026rdquo; Who am I fighting? It seems I\u0026rsquo;m fighting the negative side of the rules I created—my own uncertainty and my stubbornness regarding sadness.\n\u0026ldquo;If you want to change tomorrow, you have to change today. I know. I know. But\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; But what can I change? Based on my theoretical framework, even if I talk to others and they give me advice that moves me, I still fall back into the same patterns of sadness.\n\u0026ldquo;I thought about ending it all because I was told I was a cold person.\u0026rdquo; But I was just responding in a way I thought would be interesting to others.\n\u0026ldquo;Crying because I want to be loved is because I\u0026rsquo;ve learned the warmth of people.\u0026rdquo; Their concern is based on respect or social etiquette, not true care for me. I respond with polite, mechanical replies, void of emotion.\n\u0026ldquo;I thought about ending it all because I hadn\u0026rsquo;t met you yet\u0026hellip; because someone like you was born, I like the world a little more. Because someone like you exists, I have a little hope for the world.\u0026rdquo; But even when I seek help or get advice, I process it through my theory. It feels like a deterministic output. I call an API, input data, and get a result. If I do this, I get that. It’s too certain.\nBut life is inherently uncertain. I began to fear that uncertainty. To combat that fear, I tried to \u0026ldquo;patch\u0026rdquo; my theories, adding more sub-theories to explain away the unknown. It worked temporarily, but humans aren\u0026rsquo;t perfectly rational. Our first instinct is emotional. My theory acknowledged this—rationality told me the emotion was temporary and that time would eventually heal the wound.\nShifting from Explanation to Action Time flows like a river. I was standing on the bank calculating the volume of water, but I forgot to feel its temperature.\nI built a rational framework but became its prisoner. Even with total freedom, I felt restricted. The biggest flaw in my theory was that it over-emphasized logic and ignored experience and emotion. I was acting like an algorithm, following rules, only to realize I needed to actually express how I felt. It’s a slow transition. Changing a theory is instant, but changing a mindset or behavior is hard. It\u0026rsquo;s difficult to stop looking at everything through the lens of its \u0026ldquo;root cause.\u0026rdquo;\nI first realized my reliance on theory was becoming toxic. Even that realization could be explained by the theory itself (it explains everything, including its own failure). But people can change. Variables accumulate, weights shift, and eventually, they force a pivot.\nMeeting more people helped. Isolation protects you from social pain, but it limits your scope. I actually have my theory to thank for my first steps. While my introverted side thought talking to people was \u0026ldquo;inefficient,\u0026rdquo; the logical side told me it wasn\u0026rsquo;t illegal or against any rules, so it was a valid choice. Starting with one person with a great personality, I slowly began to change.\nBroadening my social circle allowed for deeper thinking, which refined the theory. This refined theory gave me more options (and more fears, since high risk equals high reward), but it also forced me to pay more attention to how things felt. This focus on feeling pulled me back from pure quantification.\nQuantification wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough anyway. Last month, I heard a dialogue while practicing my listening skills:\nA: Which of these two is better? B: A is pretty good. A: Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t B be better? (Explains why) B: If you already have a conclusion, why are you asking me?\nThis simple dialogue stuck with me. Often, I know what I want to do, but I don\u0026rsquo;t act. I just keep checking possibilities, trying to find every branch to maintain \u0026ldquo;certainty.\u0026rdquo; I wasn\u0026rsquo;t even looking for the \u0026ldquo;optimal\u0026rdquo; solution. That dialogue sparked something in me—the idea that the point of making a choice is to get the result you actually want.\nOr perhaps I just didn\u0026rsquo;t have a real goal. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t setting goals based on my own emotions or needs; I was setting goals based on \u0026ldquo;possibilities.\u0026rdquo; I didn\u0026rsquo;t actually like the goals I was creating.\nI started increasing the weight of the \u0026ldquo;feelings\u0026rdquo; variable. I need to prioritize the things I like. Theories are tools for understanding the world; they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the master. I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be governed by them. I should use them to reach the goals I want and the life I love!\nCurrent State I can express myself freely. I can act freely (within the law). Writing this post is proof that I\u0026rsquo;m breaking the chains. I used to think this was embarrassing—I didn\u0026rsquo;t even want to record my theories, which is why I forgot some of them.\nI realize that living is a process. That’s an unchangeable fact. As I once told a friend, \u0026ldquo;If you can\u0026rsquo;t change it, you have to adapt.\u0026rdquo; Life is full of people—the wonderful and the unfortunate. When we are sad, it’s usually because the unfortunate things have piled up and blinded us to the good things we still have.\nAs it says on my About Page , \u0026ldquo;Show up in style no matter when; put your whole heart into every experience.\u0026rdquo; To the world, I\u0026rsquo;m just an individual, a number. But to myself, I am the whole world!\n\u0026ldquo; Everything is a cloud, as long as you have a good mood ,\u0026rdquo; activate your Atopes , do what you love, buy what you like, and go where you want to go. Don\u0026rsquo;t overthink it. Express yourself.\nI’m thinking of RimoChan \u0026rsquo;s avatar right now. Truly love your life. You can spend a day in happiness or a day in pain—there\u0026rsquo;s no need for internal friction.\nConclusion What will next year bring? I\u0026rsquo;ll end with the tagline from my blog:\nLet\u0026rsquo;s program this imperfect world into the way I want it to be!\n","date":"2024-12-31T17:40:09+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/210/","title":"2024 Year in Review"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Introduction As I consume more information, I often find the need to write articles in other languages (especially since modern projects are almost always multilingual). Ever since I added i18n support to my graduation project, I\u0026rsquo;ve wanted it for everything I design or build. Even my recent practice project includes multilingual support (though that one is a bit dated; I\u0026rsquo;m working on a more modern version now).\nLooking back at my blog—the project I\u0026rsquo;ve maintained the longest—it still lacked internationalization. While I mostly write in Simplified Chinese, my previous blog was a messy mix of Chinese and English in the UI. It worked for me, but it was likely confusing for others.\nI tried setting up multilingual support in Jekyll but never quite got it right, so I switched to Hugo, which supports it natively. Every theme has its quirks, and this theme\u0026rsquo;s approach to categories and tags differs significantly from my previous one, so I\u0026rsquo;ll need time to adapt. This post is a bit rough because the configuration seems heavily theme-dependent, and the official documentation is already quite comprehensive.\nEnvironment I\u0026rsquo;m using Hugo via Docker, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to mess with local environment issues. You can see my setup here .\nCreating the Blog Create a new blog:\n1 hugo new site blogName Enter the directory:\n1 cd blogName Initialize the repository:\n1 git init Install a theme. I\u0026rsquo;m using hugo-theme-stack , but the process is similar for others:\n1 git submodule add https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack/ themes/hugo-theme-stack Configure hugo.toml to use the theme:\n1 theme = \u0026#39;hugo-theme-stack\u0026#39; Preview:\n1 hugo server Preview including drafts:\n1 hugo server -D Some changes (like configuration or page structure) might require clearing the cache:\n1 hugo --cleanDestinationDir Build the site (output defaults to the public directory):\n1 hugo Multilingual Support In your site configuration file (I use YAML), set the default language:\n1 2 defaultContentLanguage: \u0026#39;zh-cn\u0026#39; # Default language code defaultContentLanguageInSubdir: false # Whether to include the language code in the default language\u0026#39;s path Then define the specific language settings:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 languages: zh-cn: contentDir: \u0026#39;content/zh-cn\u0026#39; # Content directory for this language disabled: false languageCode: \u0026#39;zh-cn\u0026#39; languageDirection: \u0026#39;ltr\u0026#39; # Left-to-right (ltr) or right-to-left (rtl) languageName: \u0026#39;简体中文\u0026#39; title: \u0026#34;yexca\u0026#39;Blog\u0026#34; weight: 1 zh-tw: contentDir: \u0026#39;content/zh-tw\u0026#39; disabled: false languageCode: \u0026#39;zh-tw\u0026#39; languageDirection: \u0026#39;ltr\u0026#39; languageName: \u0026#39;繁體中文\u0026#39; title: \u0026#34;yexca\u0026#39;Blog\u0026#34; weight: 2 Font Internationalization: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/240 Writing Articles Unlike Jekyll, Hugo\u0026rsquo;s article structure is slightly more complex. Adding i18n makes it even more so, though this allows for high customization. This may vary by theme. In my case, the language configuration points to specific directories under content.\nYou can specify which directories contain your main content in the stack theme configuration:\n1 2 3 params: mainSections: - posts This means my Simplified Chinese posts should be in content/zh-cn/posts. Other directories are theme-specific; check your theme\u0026rsquo;s example site for details.\nTo create a new Simplified Chinese post:\n1 TZ=\u0026#34;Asia/Tokyo\u0026#34; hugo new content/zh-cn/posts/test.md If you don\u0026rsquo;t specify a timezone, it defaults to UTC. Coming from Jekyll, I find manually writing the timestamp a bit tedious.\nDefault post templates are located in blogName/archetypes and can be converted to YAML format.\nReferences Hugo - Quick start https://stack.jimmycai.com/guide/ Hugo - Multilingual mode ","date":"2024-12-27T23:11:45+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/209/","title":"Blog Internationalization with Hugo"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash A simple, no-framework Go backend.\nBackend development is typically interface-driven, or, as some say, CRUD engineering.

Reference-type channels are for communication between multiple goroutines, handling synchronization internally to ensure concurrent safety.\nKinda like RabbitMQ (just my personal analogy for easier learning, they\u0026rsquo;re actually different things).\nDeclaring Variables Channels are reference types. When copied or passed to a function, they refer to the same channel object. The zero value is nil.\nCreate them using the make() function, for example:\n1 2 3 c := make(chan int) // Add capacity of 3 c := make(chan int, 3) If the capacity is 0, the channel is unbuffered, blocking reads and writes. If greater than 0, it\u0026rsquo;s buffered and non-blocking until full, then it blocks.\nUse \u0026lt;- to send and receive data:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 // Send data to channel channel \u0026lt;- 3 // Receive and discard \u0026lt;-channel // Note no space // Receive and assign to a variable x := \u0026lt;-channel // Receive, assign to a variable, and check if successful (if channel is empty) data, flag := \u0026lt;-channel Unbuffered 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 package main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func main() { c := make(chan int) go func() { defer fmt.Println(\u0026#34;A.defer\u0026#34;) c \u0026lt;- 6 fmt.Println(\u0026#34;A running\u0026#34;) }() num := \u0026lt;-c fmt.Println(\u0026#34;num =\u0026#34;, num) fmt.Println(\u0026#34;main finished\u0026#34;) } Buffered 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;time\u0026#34; ) func main() { c := make(chan int, 3) go func() { defer fmt.Println(\u0026#34;A finished\u0026#34;) for i := 0; i \u0026lt; 3; i++ { c \u0026lt;- i fmt.Println(\u0026#34;A goroutine, i =\u0026#34;, i, \u0026#34;len =\u0026#34;, len(c), \u0026#34;cap =\u0026#34;, cap(c)) } }() time.Sleep(2 * time.Second) for i := 0; i \u0026lt; 3; i++ { num := \u0026lt;-c fmt.Println(\u0026#34;main, num =\u0026#34;, num) } fmt.Println(\u0026#34;main finished\u0026#34;) } Closing Channels Close them using close():\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 package main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func main() { c := make(chan int, 5) go func() { for i := 0; i \u0026lt; 5; i++ { c \u0026lt;- i } // Close close(c) }() for { if data, ok := \u0026lt;-c; ok { fmt.Println(data) } else { break } } fmt.Println(\u0026#34;Main Finished\u0026#34;) } Using range The above main\u0026rsquo;s for loop can be simplified using range:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 package main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func main() { c := make(chan int, 5) go func() { for i := 0; i \u0026lt; 5; i++ { c \u0026lt;- i } close(c) }() //for { // if data, ok := \u0026lt;-c; ok { // fmt.Println(data) // } else { // break // } //} for data := range c { fmt.Println(data) } fmt.Println(\u0026#34;Main Finished\u0026#34;) } Unidirectional Channels By default, channels are bidirectional (read and write).

This means you can define function parameters as unidirectional but pass a bidirectional channel.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 // chan\u0026lt;- // Write-only func counter(out chan\u0026lt;- int) { defer close(out) for i := 0; i \u0026lt; 5; i++ { out \u0026lt;- i // Will block if the receiver doesn\u0026#39;t read } } // \u0026lt;-chan // Read-only func printer(in \u0026lt;-chan int) { for num := range in { fmt.Println(num) } } func main() { c := make(chan int) // Bidirectional go counter(c) // Producer printer(c) // Consumer fmt.Println(\u0026#34;done\u0026#34;) } select select can listen for data flow on multiple channels.

Multiple coroutines share the resources allocated to their parent thread.\nGo has native support for coroutines, which are called goroutines. Concurrency in Go is achieved through goroutines and channels.\nCreating a Goroutine Use the go keyword to start a goroutine.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;time\u0026#34; ) func newTask() { i := 0 for { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;newTask goroutine i =\u0026#34;, i) i++ time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) } } func main() { go newTask() i := 0 for { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;main goroutine i =\u0026#34;, i) i++ time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) } } Using Anonymous Functions You can also use anonymous functions with goroutines.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;time\u0026#34; ) func main() { go func() { defer fmt.Println(\u0026#34;A.defer\u0026#34;) func() { defer fmt.Println(\u0026#34;B.defer\u0026#34;) fmt.Println(\u0026#34;B\u0026#34;) }() // executes this anonymous function fmt.Println(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;) }() time.Sleep(2 * time.Second) } Anonymous functions can take parameters and return values. However, to get a return value from a goroutine, you need to use a channel. The example below shows only parameters:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;time\u0026#34; ) func main() { go func(a, b int) { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;a =\u0026#34;, a, \u0026#34;b =\u0026#34;, b) }(10, 20) time.Sleep(2 * time.Second) } Exiting When the main goroutine exits, all other worker goroutines are automatically terminated.\nYou can also use runtime.Goexit() to immediately stop the current goroutine (any defer statements will still execute).\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;runtime\u0026#34; \u0026#34;time\u0026#34; ) func main() { go func() { defer fmt.Println(\u0026#34;A.defer\u0026#34;) func() { defer fmt.Println(\u0026#34;B.defer\u0026#34;) runtime.Goexit() // exit the goroutine fmt.Println(\u0026#34;B\u0026#34;) }() // executes this anonymous function fmt.Println(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;) }() time.Sleep(2 * time.Second) } /* * Output: * B.defer * A.defer */ ","date":"2024-12-17T21:16:31+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/206/","title":"GoLang Goroutines"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Golang Series\nHello GoLang: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/154 GoLang (var and const) Variables and Constants: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/155 GoLang (func) Functions: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/156 GoLang (slice and map) Slices and Maps: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/160 GoLang (OOP) Object-Oriented Programming: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/162 GoLang (reflect) Reflection: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/204 GoLang (struct tag) Struct Tags: This Article\nGoLang (goroutine) Goroutines: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/206 GoLang (channel) Channels: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/207 Struct tags allow you to describe how a field behaves when used by specific packages.\nGetting Tag Values Define tags using backticks ` (the same key used for Markdown code blocks).\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;reflect\u0026#34; ) type User struct { // Separate multiple tags with spaces name string `doc:\u0026#34;name\u0026#34; info:\u0026#34;nameOfUser\u0026#34;` age int `info:\u0026#34;ageOfUser\u0026#34;` } func main() { user := User{\u0026#34;zhangSan\u0026#34;, 18} findTag(\u0026amp;user) } func findTag(input interface{}) { t := reflect.TypeOf(input).Elem() for i := 0; i \u0026lt; t.NumField(); i++ { tagInfo := t.Field(i).Tag.Get(\u0026#34;info\u0026#34;) tagDoc := t.Field(i).Tag.Get(\u0026#34;doc\u0026#34;) fmt.Println(\u0026#34;info:\u0026#34;, tagInfo, \u0026#34;doc:\u0026#34;, tagDoc) } } JSON Conversion 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 package main import ( \u0026#34;encoding/json\u0026#34; \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; ) type User struct { // Fields must be exported (capitalized) to be converted to JSON Name string `json:\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;` Age int `json:\u0026#34;age\u0026#34;` } func main() { user := User{\u0026#34;zhangSan\u0026#34;, 18} // struct -\u0026gt; json jsonStr, err := json.Marshal(user) if err != nil { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;error\u0026#34;, err) } else { fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;jsonStr : %s\\n\u0026#34;, jsonStr) } // json -\u0026gt; struct var user2 User err = json.Unmarshal(jsonStr, \u0026amp;user2) if err != nil { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;error\u0026#34;, err) } else { fmt.Println(user2) } } ","date":"2024-12-11T18:31:18+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/205/","title":"GoLang Struct Tags"},{"content":" Golang Series\nHello GoLang: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/154 GoLang (var and const) Variables and Constants: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/155 GoLang (func) Functions: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/156 GoLang (slice and map) Slices and Maps: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/160 GoLang (OOP) Object-Oriented Programming: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/162 GoLang (reflect) Reflection: This Article\nGoLang (struct tag) Struct Tags: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/205 GoLang (goroutine) Goroutines: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/206 GoLang (channel) Channels: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/207 notify: 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Reflection refers to a class of applications that are capable of self-description and self-control.\npair A Go variable consists of a type and a value part, which together form a pair.\nThe static type is the type the programmer sees while coding, while the concrete type is what the runtime system sees.\nWhether a type assertion succeeds depends on the variable\u0026rsquo;s concrete type, not its static type. Therefore, if a read variable\u0026rsquo;s concrete type also implements a write method, it can be type-asserted as write.\nReflection is built upon types. Since static types are fixed, reflection mainly interacts with the interface type (which holds the concrete type).\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 package main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34;

My efficiency is pretty low, honestly. Overall, I\u0026rsquo;d say the difficulty is a bit lower than China\u0026rsquo;s 408 exam, but the style and focus are different, so it\u0026rsquo;s hard to make a direct comparison. Hopefully, I can pick up the pace next time!\nRamblings Haven\u0026rsquo;t written much in this \u0026lsquo;ramblings\u0026rsquo; section lately. Honestly, it\u0026rsquo;s because when I think about publishing an article, I\u0026rsquo;m usually already exhausted and just don\u0026rsquo;t have the energy. This makes me think about how I used to just consider \u0026lsquo;should I learn this?\u0026rsquo; Now, I have to factor in time, energy, and everything else. Saw a meme recently that nails it:\nCan\u0026rsquo;t you just handle civil service exams with one hand, selected civil service with another, national exams with another, provincial exams with another, teaching qualifications with another, overseas study with another, internships with another, interviews with another, probation to full employment with another, fall recruitment with another, capstone projects with another, and dating with another? Oh, and you still need to keep one hand free, because Chinese people believe in always having a backup plan.\nThat really hit home. Human energy is limited. Gaining something always means losing something else—time, energy, passion, you name it. These are all quantifiable variables, but before, their upper limits were so high (or perhaps I was just overdrawing, to be precise) that I didn\u0026rsquo;t even notice them. As I get older, or rather, as I experience more things, more and more variables need to be considered, which probably explains why I\u0026rsquo;m always tired and less efficient.\nSometimes, living is just exhausting. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m too materialistic; a bit more idealism, and the world seems pretty good (I\u0026rsquo;m afraid to make definitive statements about anything now, I fear uncertainty, but life often lacks certainty, though this stems from not mastering all variables. Won\u0026rsquo;t elaborate further, or this section will become another novel).\nBackground Consider logic circuit X, configured as shown in Fig. 5.1, with input $ck$ and outputs $z_2, z_1, z_0$. Here, $R_0, R_1, R_2$ are positive-edge triggered D flip-flops, with their outputs initialized to 0. F is a logic circuit with inputs $x_2, x_1, x_0$ and outputs $y_2, y_1, y_0$, configured as shown in Fig. 5.2. A and B are any of the 2-input gates shown in Fig. 5.3. A clock pulse with a period of 1 unit time is applied to the $ck$ input of circuit X. Hereafter, let $n$ be a positive integer and $t$ be the time. At time $t=0$, $R_0, R_1, R_2$ are initialized. The output $z_2, z_1, z_0$ is assumed to stabilize at time $t=n$ due to the rising edge of the $n$-th clock pulse after time 0. This behavior is illustrated in Fig. 5.4. For the rest of this problem, delays caused by circuit components (gates, flip-flops, and wiring) are considered negligibly small compared to the clock pulse period.\nFig. 5.1: Logic Circuit X Fig. 5.2: Logic Circuit F Fig. 5.3: 2-input Gates Fig. 5.4: Operation of Circuit X 1 Answer the following questions a~f.\na) The outputs $y_2, y_1, y_0$ of circuit F are determined solely by the values of inputs $x_2, x_1, x_0$.

Nonlinear circuit\nb) The output $z_2, z_1, z_0$ of circuit X at time $t=n$ is equal to the values of $y_2, y_1, y_0$ at time $t=$ [blank]. Express [blank] as a function of $n$.\nc) Complete the truth table representing the operation of circuit F, as shown in the table format of Fig. 5.5, so that circuit X operates as shown in Fig. 5.4.\nFig. 5.5: Operation of Circuit F d) Choose the most appropriate name for a circuit that performs the operation shown in Fig. 5.4 from the following options, and answer with the symbol ①~④.\n① Decoder ② Multiplexer ③ Counter ④ Shift Register\ne) To make circuit X operate as shown in Fig. 5.4, what gates should A and B in Fig. 5.2 be? Choose from Fig. 5.3 and answer with the symbols ①~⑥. The same gate may be used multiple times.\nf) Represent the logical AND of Boolean variables $x$ and $y$ as $xy$, the logical OR as $x+y$, and the NOT of $x$ as $\\bar{x}$. Express the output $y_2$ of circuit F.\n1-Solutions 1-a An asynchronous circuit refers to a circuit that does not use a clock signal, where each part operates independently. A combinational circuit is one whose output is determined solely by the current values of its inputs. A sequential circuit\u0026rsquo;s output depends not only on the current inputs but also on its internal state (e.g., flip-flop outputs). A nonlinear circuit refers to a circuit with input-output characteristics that are not linear. This problem clearly refers to a \u0026lsquo;Combinational circuit\u0026rsquo;.\n1-b Because a D flip-flop first receives an input and only transfers it to the output on the rising edge of the clock, due to synchronous state updates, D flip-flops introduce a one-cycle delay. So, [blank]: $n-1$.\n1-c x_2 x_1 x_0 y_2 y_1 y_0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1-d A Decoder is a combinational logic circuit that decodes a small number of input signals into a larger number of output signals. It activates the corresponding output line based on the input\u0026rsquo;s binary encoding. A Multiplexer is a combinational logic circuit that selects one signal from multiple input signals to output. It uses select lines to determine which input signal passes through to the output. A Counter is a sequential logic circuit used to count pulse signals. Its output value changes in a specific way based on the number of pulse signals. A Shift Register is a sequential logic circuit that stores data and can shift it in a specific direction. It consists of a series of flip-flops. This problem clearly refers to a \u0026lsquo;Shift Register\u0026rsquo;.\n1-e A: ② (OR) B: ① (AND)\nBy analyzing the truth table and its circuit, since there are multiple outputs, we can examine them one by one.

Using G, logic circuit Y is constructed as shown in Fig. 5.7, with $ck$ as input and $z_2,z_1,z_0$ as output. Furthermore, logic circuit $X'$ shown in Fig. 5.8 is constructed using Y. C and D in Fig. 5.8 are any of the 2-input gates shown in Fig. 5.3. Answer the following questions a~e.\nFig. 5.6: Logic Circuit G\nFig. 5.7: Logic Circuit Y\nFig. 5.8: Logic Circuit $X'$\nFig. 5.9: Operation of Circuit Y\na) Circuit G uses 5 gates to obtain output $y_0$. Describe one circuit that can obtain the same output as $y_0$ in G, using 2 or fewer gates listed in Fig. 5.3.\nb) A clock pulse with a period of 1 unit time is applied to the $ck$ input of circuit Y. Assume $R_0,R_1,R_2$ are initialized at time $t=0$, and the output $z_2,z_1,z_0$ stabilizes at time $t=n$ due to the rising edge of the $n$-th clock pulse after time 0. Complete the table in Fig. 5.9 showing the output $z_2,z_1,z_0$ of circuit Y at times $t=1,4,7,12$.\nc) Let $m$ be a non-negative integer. Under the conditions described in b), consider the output set $(z_2,z_1,z_0)$ of circuit Y at time $t=m$ as a vector and denote it as $z(m)$. What is the maximum Hamming distance between $z(m)$ and $z(m+1)$?\nd) Circuit $X'$ in Fig. 5.8 and circuit X in Fig. 5.1 exhibit equivalent behavior. In this case, choose the gates for C and D in Fig. 5.8 from Fig. 5.3 and answer with the symbols ①~⑥. The same gate may be used multiple times. \u0026lsquo;Equivalent behavior\u0026rsquo; here means the following: A clock pulse with a period of 1 unit time is applied from the same pulse generator P to the $ck$ input of both $X'$ and X, as shown in Fig. 5.10. When the outputs $w_2,w_1,w_0$ and $z_2,z_1,z_0$ respectively stabilize at time $t=n$ due to the rising edge of the D clock pulse within $X'$ and X at time $t=0$, then $w_2=z_2$, $w_1=z_1$, and $w_0=z_0$.\nFig. 5.10 e) Consider a logic circuit like the one in Fig. 5.11. Assume inputs x and y simultaneously change from 0 to 1 at time $t=t_0$. Although output z is expected to remain 0, a pulse like that shown in Fig. 5.12 can occur due to delay in the NOT gate. This phenomenon is called a glitch (or hazard) and can cause malfunction depending on the connected circuit. In circuit $X'$ of Fig. 5.8, state whether a glitch can occur at output $w_0$ if delays in gates C and D are not negligible. If it can occur, suggest countermeasures; if not, explain why, in under 100 characters. Assume delays caused by components of circuit Y (gates, flip-flops, and wiring) are negligible, and the outputs of $R_0,R_1,R_2$ change simultaneously.\nFig. 5.11: Example of a logic circuit that can generate glitches\nFig. 5.12: Example of a glitch\n2-Solutions 2-a Circuit analysis shows that $y_0=x_1x_2+\\bar{x_1}\\bar{x_2}$, which is equivalent to $x_1\\ \\text{XNOR}\\ x_2$.

Initially, it felt like a \u0026lsquo;give up\u0026rsquo; moment. But after a walkthrough, the difficulty isn\u0026rsquo;t actually that high. It just needs a solid understanding of existing algorithms. My \u0026rsquo;not too high\u0026rsquo; assessment might be skewed by my initial fears of having to design some crazy new algorithm. (To be clear, I still wouldn\u0026rsquo;t call it easy.)\nProblem copyright belongs to Tokyo University of Science. Quoted for convenience, non-profit use only.\n1 We implemented two C functions to sort an integer array a with n elements in ascending order, each using a different algorithm. For Programs 3.1 and 3.2, pick the best algorithm name for captions A and B from the choices below, then give the corresponding symbol.\nChoices\nA. Selection Sort\nB. Bubble Sort\nC. Quick Sort\nD. Insertion Sort\nProgram 3.1: A 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 void sort_a(int a[], int n) { int i, j, tmp; for(i=0; i\u0026lt;n-1; ++i){ for(j=n-1; i\u0026lt;j; --j){ if(a[j]\u0026lt;a[j-1]){ tmp=a[j]; a[j]=a[j-1]; a[j-1]=tmp; } } } } Program 3.2: B 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 void sort_b(int a[], int n) { int i, j, tmp; for(j=1; j\u0026lt;n; ++j){ tmp=a[j]; i=j-1; while(0\u0026lt;=i \u0026amp;\u0026amp; tmp\u0026lt;a[i]){ a[i+1]=a[i]; --i; } a[i+1]=tmp; } } Solution\nThis problem\u0026rsquo;s straightforward: identify the sorting algorithms from the code. Program A is Bubble Sort (B. バブルソート), and Program B is Insertion Sort (D. 挿入ソート).\n2 Answer these questions about Heap Sort. Assume n is a positive integer.\na) For a binary heap, what condition must any non-root node\u0026rsquo;s value meet? (Either max-heap or min-heap condition is fine.)\nb) If a binary heap holds n elements, what\u0026rsquo;s its height in terms of n? (Height is max path length from root to a leaf.)\nc) For Heap Sort with n elements, pick the best asymptotic evaluation for both its average and worst-case time complexity from these options.\nA. $O(1)$\nB. $O(\\log n)$\nC. $O(n)$\nD. $O(n\\log n)$\nE. $O(n^2)$\nThis one\u0026rsquo;s all about heap sort. Part one: what condition must non-root nodes satisfy in a binary heap (max-heap or min-heap, pick one). Part two: give the height of the heap\u0026rsquo;s binary tree. Part three: select the average and worst-case time complexities.\nSolution\na\nMax-heap condition: Any non-root node\u0026rsquo;s value must be less than or equal to its parent\u0026rsquo;s value. Min-heap condition: Any non-root node\u0026rsquo;s value must be greater than or equal to its parent\u0026rsquo;s value. b\n$$ \\left \\lfloor \\log_2n \\right \\rfloor $$c\nAverage and worst-case time complexity: D. $O(n\\log n)$\n3 Consider $A=\\{ A[0], A[1], \\cdots, A[n-1] \\}$, an array of $n$ distinct integers. For non-negative integers $i,j \u003c n$, if $i\\lt j$ and $A[i]\\gt A[j]$, we call $(i,j)$ an inversion of $A$. The total number of such inversions is $A$\u0026rsquo;s inversion count. For instance, in $\\{ 5,7,4,6 \\}$, inversions are $(0,2),(1,2),(1,3)$, so the inversion count is 3. Answer these questions.\na) What\u0026rsquo;s the inversion count for $\\{ 1,0,4,3,2, \\}$?\nb) Given the set $\\{ 1,2,\\cdots,n \\}$, what arrangement of its $n$ elements yields the maximum inversion count? Express this max count in terms of $n$.\nc) Take any array B (of $n$ elements) from the set $\\{ 1,2,\\cdots,n \\}$ and sort it ascending with Bubble Sort. We know \u0026lsquo;X in Bubble Sort equals array B\u0026rsquo;s inversion count\u0026rsquo;. What\u0026rsquo;s X, and why is this true? Keep it concise.\nThis problem kicks off with \u0026lsquo;inversions\u0026rsquo; (Professor Song Hao\u0026rsquo;s Linear Algebra course covers this: video ). Part one: find the inversion count. Part two: find the maximum inversion count. Part three: identify what in Bubble Sort equals the inversion count, then explain why.\nSolution\na Inversion count is 4: (1,0), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2).\nb The maximum inversion count occurs when the permutation is\n$$ \\{ n, n-1, n-2, \\cdots, 2, 1 \\} $$For n, there are n-1 inversions. For n-1, n-2 inversions. And so on. The total inversion count is their sum.\n$$ (n-1)+(n-2)+\\cdots+2+1+0=\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} $$ c X: Number of swaps\nReason: Each swap fixes exactly one inversion.\nBubble sort compares adjacent elements. If they\u0026rsquo;re out of order, it swaps them. Each swap eliminates one inversion.\n4 Program 3.3 shows a C implementation of Merge Sort to sort an integer array ascending. Answer these questions.\nProgram 3.3: Merge Sort 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 int mergesort(int a[], int begin, int end, int w[]){ int mid = (begin+end)/2; int i = begin, j = mid+1, k, c=0; printf(\u0026#34;(%d, %d)\\n\u0026#34;, begin, end); if(begin\u0026lt;end){ mergesort(a, begin, mid, w); mergesort(a, mid+1, end, w); for(k=begin; k\u0026lt;=end; ++k){ if(mid\u0026lt;1){ A }else if(end\u0026lt;j){ B }else{ /* ++c */ if(a[i]\u0026lt;a[j]){ C }else{ D } } } for(k=begin; k\u0026lt;=end; ++k){ E } } return 0; } a) Fill in blanks A, B, C, D, E with the correct code from the options to complete the program. a is the array to sort, w is the temp working array. mergesort is called like this:\n1 2 int a[5] = {3, 5, 1, 4, 2}, w[5]; mergesort(a, 0, 4, w); Choices $$ \\begin{matrix} ア. a[k]=w[i] \u0026 イ. a[k]=w[i++] \u0026 ウ. a[k]=w[++i] \\\\ エ. a[k]=w[j] \u0026 オ. a[k]=w[j++] \u0026 カ. a[k]=w[++j] \\\\ キ. a[k]=w[k] \u0026 ク. a[k]=w[k++] \u0026 ケ. a[k]=w[++k] \\\\ コ. w[k]=a[i] \u0026 サ. w[k]=a[i++] \u0026 シ. w[k]=a[++i] \\\\ ス. w[k]=a[j] \u0026 セ. w[k]=a[j++] \u0026 ソ. w[k]=a[++j] \\\\ タ. w[k]=a[k] \u0026 チ. w[k]=a[k++] \u0026 ツ. w[k]=a[++k] \\end{matrix} $$b) With the mergesort call from (a), (0,4) prints on stdout\u0026rsquo;s first line. What prints on lines 3, 5, and 7, respectively?\nc) We want to count total element comparisons (line 18 in Program 3.3) for mergesort to sort its range. We uncommented line 17 and changed it to ++c;, but that\u0026rsquo;s not enough. How do we modify Program 3.3 to store the comparison count in count using these two lines?\n1 2 int a[5] = {3, 5, 1, 4, 2}, w[5]; int count = mergesort(a, 0, 4, w); No global or static variables. Besides the line 17 change, you\u0026rsquo;re limited to 3 line replacements. A \u0026lsquo;replacement\u0026rsquo; means swapping a line\u0026rsquo;s code with new code (60 chars max, no spaces). Your answer should follow the \u0026lsquo;Example Answer Format\u0026rsquo; below: show the line number and the new code. Assume line 17 is already uncommented; detail other needed changes.\n\u0026ldquo;Example Answer Format\u0026rdquo; 6行目：printf(\u0026quot;hello\\n\u0026quot;);\n30行目：c= end - begin + 1;\nSolution\na\nA: w[k] = a[j++]; i.e., セ B: w[k] = a[i++]; i.e., サ C: w[k] = a[i++]; i.e., サ D: w[k] = a[j++]; i.e., セ E: a[k] = w[k]; i.e., キ b\nLine 3: (0,1)\nLine 5: (1,1)\nLine 7: (3,4)\nc\nLine 8: c += mergesort(a, begin, mid, w);\nLine 9: c += mergesort(a, mid + 1, end, w);\nLine 31: return c;\nThis problem looked scary at first, but after a closer read, the concepts aren\u0026rsquo;t too bad. If you get merge sort, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty solvable. BTW, I\u0026rsquo;d mostly forgotten my algorithms, usually picking them up via animations (super intuitive).

I was feeling confident until I caught a glimpse of the afternoon essay questions—my confidence vanished instantly. :cry:\nThoughts Thinking about the meaning of life is definitely something people only do when they have free time. Once you get busy, there\u0026rsquo;s no room for stray thoughts. Though if you\u0026rsquo;re too busy, you might start thinking about it again.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve realized two of my previous shortcomings. First, I always assumed I could \u0026ldquo;review anytime.\u0026rdquo; Second, I was misusing the concept of \u0026ldquo;lifelong learning.\u0026rdquo;\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with \u0026ldquo;lifelong learning.\u0026rdquo; The concept itself is correct, but my interpretation was flawed. I used to think that because knowledge is infinite, I could never fully master anything, which led to a \u0026ldquo;know-nothing\u0026rdquo; mindset. In reality, while knowledge is endless, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to be a master of an entire field to apply it effectively. Often, mastering a specific subset is enough to handle the job.\nFor example, after passing an exam, I would still feel like I knew nothing and wasn\u0026rsquo;t qualified for the work. But objectively, if you\u0026rsquo;ve mastered the necessary parts, you are capable of the task. This mindset probably stems from my education—hearing things like \u0026ldquo;the world is huge,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;what you\u0026rsquo;ve learned is never enough,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;true experts are on another level.\u0026rdquo; While this encourages learning, it made me over-focus on my deficiencies and lose confidence. I hear many students now saying \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t do anything,\u0026rdquo; and it might be a side effect of this mindset.\nThen there\u0026rsquo;s the \u0026ldquo;I can look it up anytime\u0026rdquo; dependency. When I was studying for the JLPT N2, I read an article about how people learned before writing systems. Without written records, you might only hear a lesson once in your life, so you must memorize it. The article noted that because the internet is so convenient, we stop memorizing things. We think searchable info is our own knowledge, but if the network goes down, we actually know nothing. True knowledge is what has been internalized into memory.\nIn my case, I skipped memorizing things like Linux commands or specific algorithms because I thought I could just look them up. This created an illusion of competence; when I actually needed to write them, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t. That’s effectively not knowing it. This cycle reinforced that \u0026ldquo;know-nothing\u0026rdquo; feeling.\nSummary: Realize that if it\u0026rsquo;s not memorized, you don\u0026rsquo;t know it. The knowledge required for a specific job or role has boundaries. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to chase absolute mastery of everything.\nWriting this out feels slightly off from what I meant, and I used ChatGPT to help since my writing skills aren\u0026rsquo;t great, but there it is.\n21 In a system with an instruction cache of capacity $a$ MB and access time $x$ ns, and main memory of capacity $b$ MB and access time $y$ ns, which expression represents the average access time for the main memory and instruction cache combined from the CPU\u0026rsquo;s perspective? Let $r$ be the probability that the required instruction code is not in the instruction cache (miss rate), and ignore cache management overhead.\n$$ \\begin{align} ア　\u0026\\frac{(1-r)\\cdot a}{a+b} \\cdot x +\\frac{r \\cdot b}{a+b} \\cdot y \\\\ イ　\u0026(1-r) \\cdot x + r \\cdot y \\\\ ウ　\u0026\\frac{r \\cdot a}{a+b} \\cdot x + \\frac{(1-r) \\cdot b}{a+b} \\cdot y \\\\ エ　\u0026r \\cdot x + (1-r) \\cdot y \\end{align} $$Translation/Analysis:\nCache hit time is $(1-r) \\times x$ Cache miss time (reading from main memory) is $r \\times y$ Therefore, the answer is イ.\n22 Which of the following describes the \u0026ldquo;Shared Everything\u0026rdquo; characteristic in database server clustering technology?\nア Clustering configuration improves availability; in the event of a failure, data within the failed range can be taken over by a standby server.\nイ Each server is responsible for specific managed data. If one server fails, the data managed by that server cannot be processed, reducing the overall system availability.\nウ Data is partitioned across multiple magnetic disks, and since there is a one-to-one correspondence between servers and disks, parallel processing can be performed using multiple servers.\nエ Loads are balanced to effectively utilize resources of all servers. Additionally, by sharing data, processing can continue even if one server fails.\nAnalysis: Shared Everything is a database cluster architecture where all servers share the same data storage. This allows any server\u0026rsquo;s resources to access and process any data in the database, enhancing redundancy and fault tolerance. If one server fails, others take over.\nOption ア describes a Primary/Standby (Active/Passive) architecture. Option イ describes a Shared Nothing architecture. Option ウ describes a Shared Disk architecture (roughly). Option エ describes the Shared Everything/Resource sharing mechanism. The answer is エ.\n23 Which of the following descriptions regarding the reliability of a system composed of several subsystems is appropriate?\nア Fault masking, which prevents the impact of a fault in one subsystem from spreading to others, does not change the system\u0026rsquo;s MTBF but leads to a reduction in MTTR.\nイ When a fault is detected in a subsystem, retrying may sometimes yield the correct result. Therefore, retrying leads to an improvement in the system\u0026rsquo;s MTBF and a reduction in MTTR.\nウ Fault detection performed while a subsystem is running is done without stopping the system, so it does not change the system\u0026rsquo;s MTTR but leads to an improvement in MTBF.\nエ Failover, which disconnects a failed subsystem and automatically switches to a standby subsystem, does not change the system\u0026rsquo;s MTBF but leads to a reduction in MTTR.\nAnalysis: For systems with multiple subsystems, reliability depends on MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) and MTTR (Mean Time To Repair/Recovery).\nFault Masking: Prevents faults from spreading. While it helps isolate issues, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t directly reduce the time to repair the underlying failed component as much as a failover does. Retry: This is a fault-tolerance mechanism for transient errors. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t improve the system\u0026rsquo;s MTBF (the failure still happened) and doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily shorten the repair time. Fault Detection: Detecting a fault doesn\u0026rsquo;t magically increase the time between failures (MTBF). Failover: Switches a failed system to a standby one. This significantly reduces the recovery time (MTTR) by bypassing the repair process, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t change how often the subsystems fail (MTBF). The answer is エ.\n24 Transactions $T_1 \\sim T_4$ are scheduled between times $t_{1}$ and $t_{10}$. A transaction wait-for graph was created just before $T_1$ issues a commit at time $t_{10}$. Which transaction corresponds to \u0026lsquo;a\u0026rsquo;? Here, select(X) represents referencing resource X with a shared lock, and update(X) represents updating resource X with an exclusive lock.

In the wait-for graph, an arrow $T_i \\rightarrow T_j$ indicates that $T_i$ is waiting for $T_j$ to release a lock.\n(Transaction Schedule $t_1$)\nTime $T_1$ $T_2$ $T_3$ $T_4$ $t_1$ select(A) $t_2$ select(B) $t_3$ select(B) $t_4$ select(A) $t_5$ update(B) $t_6$ select(C) $t_7$ select(C) $t_8$ update(C) $t_9$ update(A) $t_{10}$ commit (Transaction Wait-for Graph)\nア $T_1$ イ $T_2$ ウ $T_3$ エ $T_4$\nAnalysis: Shared locks (S) allow multiple readers. Exclusive locks (X) block everything.\nAt $t_5$, $T_4$ wants update(B) (X-lock). Resource B is S-locked by $T_2$ and $T_3$. So $T_4$ waits for $T_2$ and $T_3$. ($T_4 \\rightarrow T_2$ and $T_4 \\rightarrow T_3$). At $t_8$, $T_2$ wants update(C) (X-lock). Resource C is S-locked by $T_1$ (and $T_2$ itself). So $T_2$ waits for $T_1$. ($T_2 \\rightarrow T_1$). At $t_9$, $T_3$ wants update(A) (X-lock). Resource A is S-locked by $T_1$ and $T_4$. So $T_3$ waits for $T_1$ and $T_4$. ($T_3 \\rightarrow T_1$ and $T_3 \\rightarrow T_4$). Looking at the graph:\nTransaction \u0026rsquo;d\u0026rsquo; is waited on by everyone but waits for no one. This is $T_1$ (it commits at $t_{10}$). Transaction \u0026lsquo;a\u0026rsquo; is waited on by one entity and waits for \u0026rsquo;d\u0026rsquo;. Based on $T_2 \\rightarrow T_1$, \u0026lsquo;a\u0026rsquo; is $T_2$. Transactions \u0026lsquo;b\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;c\u0026rsquo; are $T_3$ and $T_4$. The answer is イ.\n25 The diagram shows a connection configuration for integrating an internal extension network using existing telephones and a PBX into an IP network.

A mechanism used to prove the creator of character image data restricted to online games.\nB. An electronic signature performed by an individual to prove the creator of electronic document data that requires identity verification, preventing tampering.\nC. An electronic signature allowed only for public institutions like national or local governments handling important documents to prove the creator and prevent tampering.\nD. For electronic documents created by a corporation, it proves that the creator is indeed that corporation and that the data has not been tampered with since creation.\nAnalysis: e-Seals are typically used for organizations or corporations to authenticate electronic documents, ensuring the creator is the legal entity and the document hasn\u0026rsquo;t been altered. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\n17 マルチベクトル型 DDoS 攻撃に該当するものはどれか。\nア　攻撃対象のWebサーバ1台に対して、多数のPCから一斉にリクエストを送ってサーバのリソースを枯渇させる攻撃と、大量のDNS通信によってネットワークの帯域を消費する攻撃を同時に行う。\nイ　攻撃対象のWebサイトのログインパスワードを解読するために、ブルートフォースによるログイン試行を、多数のスマートフォン、IoT機器などから成るボットネットを踏み台にして一斉に行う。\nウ　攻撃対象のサーバに大量のレスポンスが同時に送り付けられるようにするために、多数のオープンリゾルバに対して、送信元IPアドレスを攻撃対象のサーバのIPアドレスに偽装した名前解決のリクエストを一斉に送信する。\nエ　攻撃対象の組織内の多数の端末をマルウェアに感染させ、当該マルウェアを遠隔操作することによってデータの改ざんやファイルの消去を一斉に行う。\nTranslation: Which of the following is a multi-vector DDoS attack?\nA. Simultaneously exhausting a single target Web server\u0026rsquo;s resources by sending massive requests from multiple PCs and consuming network bandwidth with high-volume DNS traffic.\nB. Carrying out simultaneous brute-force login attempts to crack a target website\u0026rsquo;s password using a botnet consisting of smartphones and IoT devices.\nC. Sending simultaneous name resolution requests to multiple open resolvers while spoofing the source IP to the target server\u0026rsquo;s IP, so the target is flooded with response data.\nD. Infecting many terminals within a target organization with malware and remotely controlling them to tamper with data or delete files simultaneously.\nAnalysis: A multi-vector DDoS attack uses multiple attack methods at once. Option A uses both resource exhaustion and bandwidth consumption, making it a multi-vector attack. Option C is a DNS Amplification attack, which is a single vector. Option B focuses on password cracking rather than resource/bandwidth exhaustion. Option D is an intrusion/malware attack, not a DDoS-style bandwidth/resource exhaustion attack. The answer is A.\n18 暗号方式に関する記述のうち、適切なものはどれか。\nア　AESは公開鍵暗号方式、RSAは共通鍵暗号方式の一種である。\nイ　共通鍵暗号方式では、暗号化及び複合に同一の鍵を使用する。\nウ　公開鍵暗号方式を通信内容の秘匿に使用する場合は、暗号化に使用する鍵を秘密にして、複合に使用する鍵を公開する。\nエ　デジタル署名に公開鍵暗号方式が使用されることはなく、共通鍵暗号方式が使用される。\nTranslation: Which description regarding encryption methods is correct?\nA. AES is a public-key encryption method, and RSA is a common-key (symmetric) encryption method.\nB. In common-key encryption, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.\nC. When using public-key encryption for confidentiality, the encryption key is kept secret, and the decryption key is made public.\nD. Public-key encryption is never used for digital signatures; common-key encryption is used instead.\nAnalysis: This is a basic cryptography question. The answer is B. AES is symmetric (common-key), and RSA is asymmetric (public-key). For confidentiality in public-key encryption, you encrypt with the recipient\u0026rsquo;s public key and they decrypt with their private key. Digital signatures rely heavily on public-key infrastructure.\n19 CRYPTREC の役割として、適切なものはどれか。\nア　外国為替及び外国貿易法で規制されている暗号装置の輸出許可申請を審査、承認する。\nイ　政府調達においてIT関連製品のセキュリティ機能の適切性を評価、認証する。\nウ　電子政府での利用を推奨する暗号技術の安全性を評価、監視する。\nエ　民間企業のサーバに対するセキュリティ攻撃を監視、検知する。\nTranslation: Which is the correct role of CRYPTREC?\nA. Reviewing and approving export license applications for encryption devices regulated under the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act.\nB. Evaluating and certifying the appropriateness of security functions in IT-related products for government procurement.\nC. Evaluating and monitoring the security of cryptographic techniques recommended for use in e-government.\nD. Monitoring and detecting security attacks against private sector servers.\nAnalysis: CRYPTREC (Cryptography Research and Evaluation Committees) is a Japanese government project focused on cryptographic technology. Its main duties include researching, evaluating, recommending, and monitoring cryptographic algorithms to ensure security and reliability, especially for government use. Its core functions are recommending crypto tech, monitoring security, and supporting policy. The answer is C.\n20 インターネットとの接続において、ファイアウォールのNAPT機能によるセキュリティ上の効果はどれか。\nア　DMZ上にある公開Webサイトの脆弱性を悪用する攻撃を防御できる。\nイ　インターネットから内部ネットワークへの侵入を検知し、検知後の通信を遮断できる。\nウ　インターネット上の特定のWebサービスを利用するHTTP通信を検知し、遮断できる。\nエ　内部ネットワークからインターネットにアクセスする利用者PCについて、インターネットからの不正アクセスを困難にすることができる。\nTranslation: What is the security benefit of the NAPT function of a firewall when connecting to the internet?\nA. Defending against attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in public websites located in the DMZ.\nB. Detecting intrusions from the internet to the internal network and blocking communication after detection.\nC. Detecting and blocking HTTP communication that uses specific web services on the internet.\nD. Making it difficult for unauthorized access from the internet to user PCs that are accessing the internet from the internal network.\nAnalysis: NAPT (Network Address Port Translation) dynamically maps internal IP addresses and ports to external ones. Its primary security benefit is hiding internal IP addresses by sharing a single public IP, preventing external devices from directly addressing internal devices. This makes unsolicited external access much harder. The answer is D.\n","date":"2024-11-06T22:05:18+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/193/","title":"2022 SA am2 - Questions 16-20"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Introduction 2022 SA am2\n01-08: http://127.0.0.1:4000/archives/191 09-15: http://127.0.0.1:4000/archives/192 16-20: http://127.0.0.1:4000/archives/193 21-25: http://127.0.0.1:4000/archives/194 Starting from the middle questions, the difficulty is ramping up. Most of these topics are new to me, so I\u0026rsquo;m taking back what I said about this being an easy pass. However, if I passed without learning anything, there wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be much point in taking the exam. Even if I fail, the knowledge gained still has value.\nRamblings Since I wrote quite a bit here, I\u0026rsquo;m renaming the introduction to \u0026ldquo;Ramblings\u0026rdquo; (it was originally at the start, but it fits better here).\nEvery post lately seems to turn into a deep reflection (it turns out my brain has its limits).\nThese reflections actually started last year when my eyes began hurting intensely. I spent a lot of time just lying in bed listening to music (even natural scenery hurt to look at, not just screens). During that time—somewhere between dreams and reality—I developed two theories I call \u0026ldquo;State-Behavior Theory\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Circle Theory.\u0026rdquo; Since then, whenever I\u0026rsquo;m deep in thought or dreaming, I keep refining these theories. I originally wanted to publish them, but I kept procrastinating. Now I feel a bit shy about it because I haven\u0026rsquo;t cross-referenced them with existing research. I used to think this blog should be technical only, but now I don\u0026rsquo;t really care—hardly anyone reads this anyway, so I\u0026rsquo;ll write what I want.\nWhile writing this, I looked for a Warma video about \u0026ldquo;Explosion Radio.\u0026rdquo; I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find the exact one, but in her ninth episode, she mentions the feeling of making a perfect plan but then immediately wanting to scrap it just because \u0026ldquo;Why should I have to follow a plan?\u0026rdquo; This hit home. I often feel lost without a plan, but once I have one, I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve lost my freedom. It’s a loop: plan, scrap it, plan again, fail again. I want things but am afraid to approach them; a single setback makes me want to quit. Hearing someone else articulate this state makes me feel like I can break it.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve typed more than expected. I\u0026rsquo;ll stop here before this gets longer than the actual technical content.\n9 In the software testing process, you want to use a bug management chart to judge the test progress and software quality. Which of the following thoughts is the most appropriate?\nA. Because more bugs were detected than expected in the first half of the testing phase, the schedule was delayed. After revising the schedule, it was determined that testing would finish five days late.\nB. If test items are consumed according to schedule and the cumulative number of bugs detected does not increase, the software quality can be judged as high.\nC. If the cumulative number of test items completed, the cumulative number of bugs detected, and the number of unresolved bugs all stop changing, it is necessary to check if you are facing bugs that are difficult to resolve.\nD. The completion time of the test can be predicted almost accurately from the trend of the cumulative number of bugs detected and the trend of the number of unconsumed test items.\nTranslation Analysis: In testing progress and quality management, bug management charts visualize trends.\nA is irrelevant to the chart itself. B is fundamentally incorrect (no new bugs could mean bad testing). C is the correct answer. If nothing is moving, the team might be stuck on a \u0026ldquo;blocker\u0026rdquo; bug. D suggests high accuracy which is rarely the case in reality. 10 Which is the description of FMEA, an analysis method aimed at failure prevention?\nA. Identify potential failure modes that could occur in individual system components and evaluate their impact.\nB. Classify and analyze failures by the process or location where they occurred to identify processes or locations that should be improved.\nC. For a failure that has occurred, collect data and events related to the cause of the failure, and repeat \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; to dig into the cause and pursue the root cause.\nD. For a failure that has occurred, list the causes that triggered it and represent their relationship in a tree structure.\nTranslation Analysis: FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) is a systematic method to identify potential failure modes and evaluate their impact before they happen.\nA is the definition of FMEA. B is general failure classification. C is RCA (Root Cause Analysis). D is FTA (Fault Tree Analysis). Answer: A\n11 According to JIS X 0160:2021 (Software Life Cycle Processes), which task should be performed in the activity \u0026ldquo;Confirm Disposal\u0026rdquo; within the disposal process?\nA. Reuse, recycle, recondition, overhaul, store, or destroy selected software system elements.\nB. Define the disposal strategy for the software system.\nC. Prepare to deactivate and remove the software system or elements.\nD. Confirm that harmful conditions to human health, safety, security, and the environment after disposal are identified and addressed.\nTranslation Analysis:\nA is the actual execution of disposal. B is the planning/strategy phase. C is preparation. D is the \u0026ldquo;confirmation\u0026rdquo; aspect of ensuring the disposal was handled correctly and safely. Answer: D\n12 According to JIS X 0160:2021 (Software Life Cycle Processes), what is it called to modify a life cycle process or define a new life cycle process to achieve the purpose and results of the life cycle model?\nA. Simulation B. Tailoring C. Governance D. Benchmarking\nTranslation Analysis:\nTailoring is the standard term for adapting a process to fit specific project needs. Answer: B\n13 When setting KPIs for IT investment evaluation using the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) method, which is an example of a KPI from the internal business process perspective?\nA. Set the attendance rate of training sessions for improving IT literacy to 100%. B. Increase the operating profit margin by 5% compared to the same period last year. C. Keep the number of customer complaints within 20 per month. D. Reduce the number of days from order acceptance to product shipment by 3 days.\nTranslation Analysis: Balanced Scorecard perspectives:\nFinancial: Profit, ROI (Option B). Customer: Satisfaction, complaints (Option C). Internal Business Process: Efficiency, cycle time, quality (Option D). Learning and Growth: Training, employee skills (Option A). Answer: D\n14 In embedded system development, a new LSI to be installed in a product is being developed. If the LSI design is done in-house and the LSI manufacturing is outsourced, which is the appropriate type of contractor?\nA. IP Provider B. Design House C. Foundry D. Fabless Manufacturer\nTranslation Analysis:\nIP Provider: Sells design building blocks. Design House: Helps with the design. Foundry: A factory that specifically manufactures chips for other companies. Fabless: A company that designs but doesn\u0026rsquo;t have its own factory. Since we need someone to manufacture our design, we look for a Foundry.\nAnswer: C\n15 What is a characteristic of a Lab Contract?\nA. A contract where the client designates specific personnel from the vendor and provides direct instructions; the vendor assigns personnel based on this.\nB. The client asks the vendor to secure personnel meeting specific skill and headcount requirements based on the contract, and in return, the client guarantees a certain minimum level of orders.\nC. The contract amount paid to the vendor during development is kept low on the condition that the vendor also receives a share of the sales or profits the client earns from the developed system in the future.\nD. If the vendor completes the work in fewer man-hours than the minimum specified in the contract, they are required to bill based on actual man-hours worked.\nTranslation Analysis: A Lab Contract (or ODC - Offshore Development Center style) involves a vendor providing a dedicated team of a certain size/skill for a period, regardless of the specific project tasks.\nB describes this \u0026ldquo;capacity-based\u0026rdquo; arrangement. C describes a revenue-sharing model. Answer: B\n","date":"2024-11-04T23:29:15+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/192/","title":"2022 SA am2 -09-15"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Introduction 2022 SA am2\n01-08: http://127.0.0.1:4000/archives/191 09-15: http://127.0.0.1:4000/archives/192 16-20: http://127.0.0.1:4000/archives/193 21-25: http://127.0.0.1:4000/archives/194 The difficulty of this specific exam seems manageable, but there are still things I\u0026rsquo;ve already studied. I should be able to pass the objective questions after some solid review. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to finish these quickly and move on to the afternoon questions, as those are the real key to passing.\nThinking back, my approach for the first Common Subject exam was flawed. It’s pointless to grind through questions when I don\u0026rsquo;t understand the concepts at all. It\u0026rsquo;s better to take it slow, one question at a time. Previously, I was rushing to finish the analysis articles, which made that entire practice run basically useless. Since I\u0026rsquo;m just starting, it\u0026rsquo;s fine to go slow and steady.\nRandom Thoughts Lately, I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking of learning as a form of \u0026ldquo;connection.\u0026rdquo; My inspiration came from language learning, which is essentially connecting objects to words. Learning abstract concepts is similar: it\u0026rsquo;s about forming connections where a specific input produces a specific output. You deepen these links through repetition. A more direct example is how knowledge points relate; deriving one point from another is like building a bridge between two pieces of data. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve seen or derived this link, and then strengthened it, you\u0026rsquo;ve mastered the concept—just like how you master an object by learning its name. (Of course, this is just a random thought without proof. Most opinions I hear are probably based on personal experience rather than rigorous evidence anyway.) We form views based on our experiences; it\u0026rsquo;s hard to imagine what we haven\u0026rsquo;t seen. The only exception might be dreams. Maybe dreams are actually us visiting other worlds? This isn\u0026rsquo;t rigorous either, but I recently read a novel where the protagonist enters a world at a random location and, if they complete specific conditions, can keep memories or gains from that world. My own dreams made me lean toward this theory. But on second thought, it\u0026rsquo;s more likely that when we sleep, the brain can focus entirely on imagination, reaching its peak and creating things we can\u0026rsquo;t fathom while awake. For instance, the discoverer of the DNA double helix structure allegedly got the inspiration from a dream.\n1 In the early stages of agile development, which method involves stakeholders gathering to confirm pre-set questions and issues to reach a common understanding of project objectives, scope, etc., and then sharing the results?\nA. Agile Modeling\nB. Inception Deck\nC. Planning Poker\nD. User Story Mapping\nTranslation of Japanese options: ア Agile Modeling イ Inception Deck ウ Planning Poker エ User Story Mapping\nThe Inception Deck is a vital tool used particularly at the start of a project to ensure the team reaches a consensus on the project\u0026rsquo;s purpose and scope. The team explores critical questions (goals, risks, success criteria, etc.) beforehand, which helps everyone align on the overall direction and boundaries. Therefore, the correct answer is B (イ).\n2 Among software patterns, which description applies to GoF (Gang of Four) design patterns?\nA. As Java patterns, they consist of Argument Objects, Object Mutability, etc.\nB. Patterns for object-oriented development, categorized into three types: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.\nC. Categorized into four types: Structural, Distributed Systems, Interactive Systems, and Adaptive Systems.\nD. Consists of \u0026ldquo;Layers\u0026rdquo; for dividing elements of different abstraction levels into hierarchies, and \u0026ldquo;Broker\u0026rdquo; for component partitioning.\nTranslation of Japanese options: ア Java patterns\u0026hellip; イ Patterns for OO development, categorized into Creational, Structural, and Behavioral\u0026hellip; ウ Four categories: Structural, Distributed, Interactive, Adaptive\u0026hellip; エ Consists of Layers, Broker\u0026hellip;\nGoF design patterns are classic patterns proposed by four software engineers specifically for object-oriented programming. They are divided into three major categories: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral, used to solve common OO design problems. Therefore, the correct answer is B (イ).\nI looked up some related info , and it seems this is where the design patterns I wrote about previously originated.\n3 Among the architecture patterns in Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture (POSA), which one provides a mechanism to dynamically change the structure and behavior of software by splitting it into two levels: a meta-level and a base-level?\nA. Broker\nB. Microkernel\nC. Model-View-Controller\nD. Reflection\nTranslation of Japanese options: ア Broker イ Microkernel ウ Model-View-Controller エ Reflection\nThe Broker pattern is for distributed systems, aiming to decouple components (clients and servers) by using a broker for communication.\nThe Microkernel pattern is common in OS design, keeping core functions (memory/process management) in the kernel while implementing other features as pluggable modules.\nModel-View-Controller (MVC) is an interactive system pattern that separates business logic (Model), UI (View), and input control (Controller). It decouples logic but doesn\u0026rsquo;t focus on dynamic structural changes.\nThe Reflection pattern splits software into a \u0026ldquo;meta-level\u0026rdquo; and a \u0026ldquo;base-level.\u0026rdquo; The meta-level holds metadata describing the system\u0026rsquo;s structure/behavior, while the base-level handles the business logic. This allows the software to modify its own structure and behavior dynamically. It\u0026rsquo;s often used in systems requiring high extensibility. Therefore, the correct answer is D (エ).\n4 When using a DBMS in an embedded system, an in-process database is sometimes used to prevent communication overhead, avoid communication load, and keep the required memory within resource limits. Which of the following is an appropriate description of an in-process database?\nA. It communicates via sockets with an application program acting as a client in a client-server format and uses SQL for processing.\nB. The database engine is provided as a library, linked with the application program, and runs in the same memory space.\nC. The entire database is placed in memory to speed up database processing.\nD. Each table is managed as a single file, and the application program operates it via file I/O APIs.\nTranslation of Japanese options: ア Socket communication, client-server\u0026hellip; イ Library format, linked to app, same memory space\u0026hellip; ウ Entire DB in memory\u0026hellip; エ One table per file, file I/O APIs\u0026hellip;\nAn in-process database (インプロセスデータベース) means the DB engine is linked as a library within the application, sharing the same memory space. This avoids the overhead of client-server communication, making it ideal for resource-constrained embedded systems.\nOption A describes a client-server DB; Option C describes an \u0026ldquo;In-memory database\u0026rdquo;; Option D describes a file-based management approach. Therefore, the correct answer is B (イ).\n5 Using the Strategy pattern, a report output system was designed according to the following class diagram. Which description is appropriate?\nA. The client can use the report output strategy subclasses without being aware of the specific format being used.\nB. It is easy to add algorithms for new formats.\nC. The report output strategy class handles the logic of which format to use for the output.\nD. The report output algorithm is written inside the context class.\nTranslation of Japanese options: ア Client doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to know the subclass\u0026hellip; イ Easy to add new format algorithms\u0026hellip; ウ Strategy class handles the dispatching\u0026hellip; エ Algorithm is in the Context class\u0026hellip;\nThe diagram shows the Strategy pattern implemented for multi-format report generation. The core principle is separating the implementation of an algorithm from its use, allowing you to switch or add algorithms without touching the client code. I\u0026rsquo;ve actually written about Strategy pattern before .\nThe design makes adding new algorithms very convenient—you just implement a new concrete strategy class. Therefore, the correct answer is B (イ).\n6 Among the following methods of passing data between modules, which one results in the lowest module coupling?\nA. Passing a single data item via global data.\nB. Passing a single data item via arguments.\nC. Passing a data structure via global data.\nD. Passing a data structure via arguments.\nTranslation of Japanese options: ア Single item via global\u0026hellip; イ Single item via arguments\u0026hellip; ウ Data structure via global\u0026hellip; エ Data structure via arguments\u0026hellip;\nThis is about software coupling. I\u0026rsquo;ve also written an article on this .\nPassing a single value is \u0026ldquo;Data Coupling,\u0026rdquo; passing a data structure is \u0026ldquo;Stamp Coupling,\u0026rdquo; and using global parameters is \u0026ldquo;Common Coupling.\u0026rdquo; Data coupling has the lowest degree of coupling. Therefore, the correct answer is B (イ).\n7 What is the appropriate sequence of steps for creating a DFD when modeling a new system based on an existing one?\nA. Current Physical -\u0026gt; Current Logical -\u0026gt; New Physical -\u0026gt; New Logical\nB. Current Physical -\u0026gt; Current Logical -\u0026gt; New Logical -\u0026gt; New Physical\nC. Current Logical -\u0026gt; Current Physical -\u0026gt; New Physical -\u0026gt; New Logical\nD. Current Logical -\u0026gt; Current Physical -\u0026gt; New Logical -\u0026gt; New Physical\nTranslation of Japanese options: ア Current Phys -\u0026gt; Current Logic -\u0026gt; New Phys -\u0026gt; New Logic イ Current Phys -\u0026gt; Current Logic -\u0026gt; New Logic -\u0026gt; New Phys ウ Current Logic -\u0026gt; Current Phys -\u0026gt; New Phys -\u0026gt; New Logic エ Current Logic -\u0026gt; Current Phys -\u0026gt; New Logic -\u0026gt; New Phys\nI\u0026rsquo;ll bet on B (イ). Generally, creating a DFD involves abstracting business requirements from the current implementation (Physical to Logical), then improving that logical model for the new requirements (Current Logical to New Logical), and finally implementing the new physical system (New Physical).\n8 In the development of a certain procurement system, which of the following is an appropriate example of exploratory testing performed by a developer?\nA. Based on past experience developing procurement systems, the developer guessed data patterns likely to detect flaws in input item correlation checks and created test cases in advance.\nB. To confirm if the product price applied according to the quantity range is correct, test cases using the median value of each range were created and tested.\nC. To confirm if organization names are printed correctly before and after an organizational change, test cases were created in advance using the effective start date and the day before as order dates.\nD. To confirm that no slip is created when the combination of input values is invalid, several representative combinations were tested, and based on those results, the next test cases were created and tested repeatedly.\nTranslation of Japanese options: ア Guessed patterns based on experience, pre-made test cases\u0026hellip; イ Used median values for range testing\u0026hellip; ウ Pre-made cases for date-based changes\u0026hellip; エ Tested combinations, created next cases based on results repeatedly\u0026hellip;\nExploratory testing is a style where test design and execution occur dynamically. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t rely on fixed, pre-defined test cases; instead, you adjust the test plan in real-time based on system observations. The key is that test cases are not fully pre-set but are refined based on prior results.\nIn options A, B, and C, the test cases are created in advance, which is traditional scripted testing. Option D involves a feedback loop based on results. Therefore, the correct answer is D (エ).\n","date":"2024-11-03T23:11:52+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/191/","title":"2022 SA am2 -01-08"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Introduction 2022 SA am1\n01-02: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/184 03-05: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/185 06-10: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/186 11-15: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/189 16-30: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/190 Going through this entire paper, a lot of it feels like the Software Designer exam. I guess some common subjects have lower requirements for software development, while specialized papers might be tougher. Many technical terms are hard to grasp at first, but once translated, the problems are manageable. Memorizing those terms is definitely key.\nQuestion 16 In the following flowchart, which is the minimum set of test cases required to satisfy branch coverage?\nA: (1) A=0, B=0 (2) A=1, B=1\nB: (1) A=1, B=0 (2) A=1, B=1\nC: (1) A=0, B=0 (2) A=1, B=1 (3) A=1, B=0\nD: (1) A=0, B=0 (2) A=0, B=1 (3) A=1, B=0\nThis question asks for the minimum number of test cases to hit every branch. No detailed analysis needed; the answer is Option B (イ).\nQuestion 17 No problems have occurred, but to resolve inconsistencies between the program specifications and the current source code, reverse engineering is used to rewrite the specifications. Which category of software maintenance does this fall into?\nA: Perfective Maintenance\nB: Corrective Maintenance\nC: Adaptive Maintenance\nD: Preventive Maintenance\nTranslation/Analysis:\nOld memories are coming back to haunt me—I learned this but forgot it all.\nPerfective Maintenance: Enhancing software functions, performance, or quality to meet new requirements. Corrective Maintenance: Fixing defects or errors in the software. Adaptive Maintenance: Adapting software to environmental changes (like a new OS or hardware). Preventive Maintenance: Performing maintenance to prevent potential problems before they happen. So, the answer is Option D (エ).\nQuestion 18 An organization uses Earned Value Management (EVM) to manage project schedule and cost. For a 10-day project, the status at the end of day 5 is shown in the table. If the cost efficiency remains the same, what is the Estimated at Completion (EAC) in ten thousand yen?\nManagement Item Amount (10k Yen) Budget at Completion (BAC) 100 Planned Value (PV) 50 Earned Value (EV) 40 Actual Cost (AC) 60 A: 110\nB: 120\nC: 135\nD: 150\nAnalysis:\nThis is new territory for me. The formula for Estimated at Completion (EAC) is:\n$$ EAC=\\frac{BAC}{CPI} $$Where CPI (Cost Performance Index) is:\n$$ CPI=\\frac{EV}{AC} $$Plugging in the numbers:\n$$ \\begin{align} CPI\u0026=\\frac{40}{60}=\\frac{2}{3} \\\\ EAC\u0026=\\frac{100}{\\frac{2}{3}}=150 \\end{align} $$The answer is Option D (エ).\nQuestion 19 In a software development project, what is the shortest duration (in days) required to complete all tasks in the table?\nTask Prerequisites Duration (Days) Requirements Def. None 30 Design Requirements Def. Done 20 Manufacturing Design Done 25 Testing Manufacturing Done 15 User Manual Creation Design Done 20 User Training Testing \u0026amp; User Manual Done 10 A: 80\nB: 95\nC: 100\nD: 120\nAnalysis:\nJust draw the network diagram. It\u0026rsquo;s a straightforward one. The answer is Option C (ウ).\nQuestion 20 In ITIL 2011 edition, an example of a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for Availability Management is shortening the \u0026ldquo;metric representing maintainability.\u0026rdquo; Which of the following corresponds to a maintainability metric?\nA: Number of interruptions within a certain period\nB: Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)\nC: Mean Time Between Service Incidents (MTBSI)\nD: Mean Time to Restore Service (MTTRS)\nAnalysis:\nIn ITIL Availability Management, maintainability usually refers to the ability to restore or repair a system after a failure, rather than the frequency of failures. Mean Time to Restore Service (MTTRS) describes recovery speed—how long it takes on average to get back up. The answer is Option D (エ).\nQuestion 21 In the construction and operation of core business systems, if a Data Administrator (DA) and a Database Administrator (DBA) are appointed separately, which of the following is an appropriate role for the DA?\nA: Tracking trends in business data volume growth and planning disk expansions.\nB: During the design phase, primarily performing logical database design and managing/standardizing data items.\nC: During the testing phase, primarily handling performance tuning.\nD: When a system failure occurs, performing data recovery and consistency checks.\nAnalysis:\nA Data Administrator (DA) focuses on logical data management, including data standards, definitions, and logical design. The DBA usually handles hardware resources, performance tuning, and recovery. The answer is Option B (イ).\nQuestion 22 Regarding the acquisition and evaluation of audit evidence, which description is inappropriate according to the System Audit Standards (2018)?\nA: In an Agile system development project, only documents formatted as formal management documents can be used as audit evidence.\nB: In an audit of an outsourced business site, if the auditor decides they can rely on a third-party assurance report from the contractor, the on-site survey can be omitted.\nC: Before the main investigation to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence, a preliminary investigation is conducted to understand the actual state of the audit target.\nD: For a single audit objective, multiple audit procedures are usually combined to perform the audit.\nAnalysis:\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t know this specific standard, but system audit standards don\u0026rsquo;t mandate that Agile project evidence must be \u0026ldquo;formally formatted management documents.\u0026rdquo; In practice, informal docs (meeting minutes, code repos, boards) are valid evidence of actual status. The answer is Option A (ア).\nQuestion 23 Which of the following is the explanation for BPO?\nA: Constructing a mechanism to ensure important business operations are not interrupted, or the interruption period is minimized, even after damage from disasters or accidents.\nB: Outsourcing some or all non-core business operations to specialized external companies.\nC: A production management method that determines the required quantity and timing of materials based on a master production schedule, Bill of Materials (BOM), and inventory info.\nD: Evaluating projects based on strategic alignment, cost-effectiveness, and risk to manage and optimize the balance of IT investment.\nAnalysis:\nBPO (Business Process Outsourcing) is about delegating non-core tasks to external pros to focus on core business. The answer is Option B (イ).\nOption A is Business Continuity Plan (BCP). Option C is Material Requirements Planning (MRP). Option D is Project Portfolio Management (PPM). Question 24 In IT investment evaluation methods, which metric calculates how many years it takes to recover the initial cash outflow based on cash flow?\nA: IRR (Internal Rate of Return)\nB: NPV (Net Present Value)\nC: PBP (Pay Back Period)\nD: ROI (Return On Investment)\nAnalysis:\nIRR: The discount rate where NPV equals zero; measures profitability. NPV: Sum of present values of future cash flows minus initial investment. PBP: Payback Period; the answer. ROI: Ratio of profit to investment cost. The answer is C (ウ).\nQuestion 25 Among UML diagrams, which one is used in business requirements definition to describe business flows and can represent branching, parallel processing, and synchronization?\nA: Activity Diagram\nB: Class Diagram\nC: State Machine Diagram\nD: Use Case Diagram\nAnalysis:\nActivity diagrams are perfect for business processes, showing branches, parallel paths, and synchronization. Class diagrams show static structure. State machine diagrams show object lifecycles. Use case diagrams define functional requirements and actor interactions. The answer is Option A (ア).\nQuestion 26 In PPM (Product Portfolio Management), which business is positioned as a source of investment funds?\nA: High market growth rate, high relative market share.\nB: High market growth rate, low relative market share.\nC: Low market growth rate, high relative market share.\nD: Low market growth rate, low relative market share.\nAnalysis:\nIn the BCG matrix (PPM), this is the \u0026ldquo;Cash Cow.\u0026rdquo; High market share brings stable cash flow, while low growth means minimal need for reinvestment, making it a source of funds for other ventures. The answer is Option C (ウ).\nQuestion 27 In the semiconductor industry, what is a characteristic business model of a foundry company compared to a fabless company?\nA: Outsourcing production to factories to reduce investment in production equipment.\nB: Focusing on the design and marketing of their own products to open new markets.\nC: Focusing on selling their own products to expand sales.\nD: Specialized in taking on production contracts from multiple companies to produce many products at low cost.\nAnalysis:\nFoundries focus on manufacturing. They don\u0026rsquo;t design their own chips; they provide production services for others. This allows for high-volume, low-cost production. The answer is Option D (エ).\nQuestion 28 Which type of information is the primary target of XBRL?\nA: Medical charts/records.\nB: Corporate customer information.\nC: Corporate financial information.\nD: Local government resident information.\nAnalysis:\nXBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) is a standard for business and financial reporting. The answer is Option C (ウ).\nQuestion 29 Which of the following is a characteristic of PM theory in leadership studies?\nA: Focuses on analyzing personal traits like personality, intelligence, and appearance of great leaders.\nB: Focuses on two dimensions of leadership style: Performance (goal achievement) and Maintenance (group maintenance).\nC: Leadership effectiveness depends on the situational factor of subordinate maturity (autonomy).\nD: Leadership effectiveness depends on the leader\u0026rsquo;s personality and situational factors like control and influence.\nAnalysis:\nPM theory (Performance-Maintenance) argues leadership style is built on those two dimensions. The answer is Option B (イ).\nQuestion 30 Company A commissioned Company B to create a sales management system program based on Company A\u0026rsquo;s requirements, without any specific agreement regarding copyright. In this case, which description of the original attribution of the program copyright is appropriate?\nA: Company A and B negotiate to decide attribution.\nB: It is jointly owned by Company A and B.\nC: It belongs to Company A.\nD: It belongs to Company B.\nAnalysis:\nWithout a specific agreement, under Japanese copyright law (similar to China), the copyright of a work created under contract usually belongs to the actual creator, which is Company B. It only goes to the client (Company A) if the contract explicitly says so. The answer is Option D (エ).\n","date":"2024-10-28T19:04:14+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/190/","title":"2022 SA am1 -16-30"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Introduction 2022 SA am1\n01-02: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/184 03-05: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/185 06-10: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/186 11-15: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/189 16-30: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/190 Quick Ramble My eyes have been hurting lately. It starts after barely an hour of screen time, and everything gets blurry. I definitely need to rest them; it would be a disaster if my vision gets any worse. (If they didn\u0026rsquo;t hurt, I probably would have finished this entire exam paper by now).\nQuestion 11 OpenFlow を使った SDN(Software-Defined Networking) に関する記述として、適切なものはどれか。\nア　インターネットのドメイン名を管理する世界規模の分散データベースを用いて、IPアドレスの代わりに名前を指定して通信できるようにする仕組む\nイ　携帯電話網において、回線交換方式ではなく、パケット交換方式で音声通話を実現する方式\nウ　ストレージ装置とサーバを接続し、WWN(World Wide Name) によってノードやポートを識別するストレージ用ネットワーク\nエ　データ転送機能とネットワーク制御機能を論理的に分離し、ネットワーク制御を集中的に行う可能にしたアーキテクチャ\nTranslation: Which of the following descriptions regarding SDN (Software-Defined Networking) using OpenFlow is correct?\nA: Using a global distributed database to manage internet domain names so that communication can be performed using names instead of IP addresses.\nB: A method in mobile communication networks that realizes voice calls via packet switching instead of circuit switching.\nC: A storage network that connects storage devices and servers, identifying nodes and ports via WWN (World Wide Name).\nD: An architecture that logically separates the data forwarding function from the network control function, enabling centralized network control.\nAnalysis: Option A describes DNS. Option B describes VoIP (Voice over IP) in mobile networks. Option C describes SAN (Storage Area Network). Therefore, the correct answer is Option D.\nQuestion 12 メッセージの送受信における署名鍵の使用に関する記述のうち、適切なものはどれか。\nア　送信者が送信者の署名鍵を使ってメッセージに対する署名を作成し、メッセージに付加することによって、受信者が送信者による署名であることを確認できようになる。\nイ　送信者が送信者の署名鍵を使ってメッセージを暗号化することによって、受信者が受信者の署名鍵を使って、暗号文を元のメッセージに戻すことができるようになる。\nウ　送信者が送信者の署名鍵を使ってメッセージを暗号化することによって、メッセージの内容が関係者以外に分からないようになる。\nエ　送信者がメッセージに固定文字列を付加し、更に送信者の署名鍵を使って暗号化することによって、受信者がメッセージの改ざん部位を特定できるようになる。\nTranslation: Which of the following descriptions regarding the use of signature keys in message transmission is correct?\nA: The sender creates a signature for the message using their own signature key and attaches it to the message, allowing the receiver to verify that the signature was generated by the sender.\nB: The sender encrypts the message using their signature key so that the receiver can restore the original message using the receiver\u0026rsquo;s signature key.\nC: The sender encrypts the message using their signature key to ensure the message content remains unknown to anyone except the parties involved.\nD: The sender attaches a fixed string to the message and encrypts it with their signature key, allowing the receiver to identify the specific part of the message that was tampered with.\nAnalysis: Digital signatures usually refer to RSA algorithms here. Generally, you decrypt with a public key; the private key (signature key) is never leaked, so Option B is incorrect. Signature keys aren\u0026rsquo;t used for message confidentiality because the public key is public—anyone can decrypt it—so Option C is incorrect. Cryptographic keys cannot pinpoint which specific part of a message was tampered with; they only detect if tampering occurred. Thus, Option D is incorrect. The correct answer is Option A.\nQuestion 13 クライアント証明書で利用者を確認するリバースプロキシサーバを用いて、複数のWebサーバにシングルサインオンを行うシステムがある。このシステムに関する記述のうち、適切なものはどれか。\nア　クライアント証明書を利用者のPCに送信するのは、Webサーバではなく、リバースプロキシサーバである。\nイ　クライアント証明書を利用者のPCに送信するのは、リバースプロキシサーバではなく、Webサーバである。\nウ　利用者IDなどの情報をWebサーバに送信するのは、リバースプロキシサーバではなく、利用者のPCである。\nエ　利用者IDなどの情報をWebサーバに送信するのは、利用者のPCではなく、リバースプロキシサーバである。\nTranslation: There is a system that uses a reverse proxy server to verify users via client certificates and perform Single Sign-On (SSO) across multiple web servers. Which description of this system is correct?\nA: The reverse proxy server, not the web server, sends the client certificate to the user\u0026rsquo;s PC.\nB: The web server, not the reverse proxy server, sends the client certificate to the user\u0026rsquo;s PC.\nC: The user\u0026rsquo;s PC, not the reverse proxy server, sends information such as the user ID to the web server.\nD: The reverse proxy server, not the user\u0026rsquo;s PC, sends information such as the user ID to the web server.\nAnalysis: This setup is common in large enterprises. Client certificates are stored on the client side; the reverse proxy handles the certificate verification (Options A and B are logically flawed regarding \u0026ldquo;sending\u0026rdquo; certificates to the PC in this context). Once the reverse proxy completes verification, it forwards the user information to the backend web servers. Therefore, the answer is Option D.\nQuestion 14 内部ネットワークのPCからインターネット上のWebサイトを参照するときに、DMZに設置したVDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure) サーバ上のWebブラウザを利用すると、未知のマルウェアがPCにダウンロードされるのを防ぐというセキュリティ上の効果が期待できる。この効果を生み出すVDIサーバの動作の特徴はどれか。\nア　Webサイトからの受信データを受信処理した後、IPsecでカプセル化し、PCに送信する。\nイ　Webサイトからの受信データを受信処理した後、実行ファイルを削除し、その他のデータをPCに送信する。\nウ　Webサイトからの受信データを受信処理した後、生成したデスクトップ画面の画像データだけをPCに送信する。\nエ　Webサイトからの受信データを受信処理した後、不正なコード列が検知されない場合だけPCに送信する。\nTranslation: When a PC on an internal network accesses a website on the internet, using a web browser on a VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure) server located in the DMZ can prevent unknown malware from being downloaded to the PC. Which characteristic of the VDI server produces this security effect?\nA: After processing received data from the website, it encapsulates it with IPsec and sends it to the PC.\nB: After processing received data from the website, it deletes executable files and sends other data to the PC.\nC: After processing received data from the website, it sends only the generated desktop screen image data to the PC.\nD: After processing received data from the website, it sends it to the PC only if no malicious code strings are detected.\nAnalysis: The answer is Option C. By definition, a virtual desktop setup only transmits the visual screen data to the client, preventing the actual transfer of malicious binaries to the local host.\nQuestion 15 ファジングに該当するものはどれか。\nア　サーバにFINバケットを送信し、サーバからの応答を観測して、稼働しているサービスを見つけ出す。\nイ　サーバのOSやアプリケーションソフトウェアが生成したログやコマンド履歴などの解析して、ファイルサーバに保存されているファイルの改ざんを検知する。\nウ　ソフトウェアに、問題を引き起こしそうな多様なデータを入力し、挙動を監視して、脆弱性を見つけ出す。\nエ　ネットワーク上を流れるバケットを収集し、そのプロトコルヘッダやペイロードを解析して、あらかじめ登録された攻撃パターンと一致するものを検出する。\nTranslation: Which of the following corresponds to Fuzzing?\nA: Sending FIN packets to a server and observing the response to discover running services.\nB: Analyzing logs and command history generated by the server OS or application software to detect tampering with files stored on a file server.\nC: Inputting various data that might cause problems into software and monitoring its behavior to find vulnerabilities.\nD: Collecting packets flowing over the network and analyzing their protocol headers and payloads to detect matches with pre-registered attack patterns.\nAnalysis: Fuzzing is an automated software testing technique that provides invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a computer program to find security vulnerabilities. The goal is to see if the program crashes or behaves unexpectedly. Therefore, the answer is Option C.\nOption A describes a FIN scan (similar to nmap). Option B describes part of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Option D describes a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using signature-based detection.\n","date":"2024-10-26T21:41:16+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/189/","title":"2022 SA am1 -11-15"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash Introduction 2022 SA am1\n01-02: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/184 03-05: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/185 06-10: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/186 11-15: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/189 16-30: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/190 Could be these questions are shared across multiple exam sessions, so they\u0026rsquo;re pretty foundational. Feels like the difficulty of the intermediate Software Designer (SoftQual) level. There are four exam sessions total, though; no idea when I\u0026rsquo;ll wrap up this first one.\nQuestion 6 一つの $I^2C$ バスに接続された二つのセンサがある。それぞれのセンサ値を読み込む二つのタスで排他的に制御したい。利用するリアルタイムOSの機能として、適切なものはどれか。\nア　キュー\nイ　セマフォ\nウ　マルチスレッド\nエ　ラウンドロビン\nQuestion translation: Two sensors share an I²C bus. To ensure two tasks read their sensor values exclusively, which RTOS feature is appropriate?\nA: Queue\nB: Semaphore\nC: Multithreading\nD: Round Robin\nA queue is a FIFO data structure, good for inter-task communication or data passing.\nA semaphore is a sync mechanism, mainly for controlling shared resource access. It prevents multiple tasks from touching the same resource concurrently. We have binary semaphores (for exclusive access) and counting semaphores (for managing resource pools).\nMultithreading means running multiple threads concurrently within one process. By itself, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t handle exclusive control. You usually pair it with semaphores or mutexes for safe shared resource access.\nRound-robin is a simple task scheduling algorithm, like time-slice round robin.\nThe options themselves are okay, but being all katakana definitely cranks up the difficulty. So, for this one, it\u0026rsquo;s option B.\nQuestion 7 アクチュエータの説明として、適切なものはどれか。\nア　与えられた目標量と、センサから得られた制御量に比較し、制御量を目標量に一致させるように操作量を出力する。\nイ　位置、角度、速度、加速度、力、温度などを検出し、電気的な情報に変換する。\nウ　エネルギー源からのパワーを、回転、直進などの働きに変換する。\nエ　マイクロフォン、センサなどが出力する微小な電気信号を増幅する。\nQuestion translation: Which statement correctly describes an actuator?\nA: Compares a target value with a sensor-read control value, then outputs an operating variable to match the control value to the target.\nB: Detects position, angle, speed, acceleration, force, temperature, etc., and converts them to electrical signals.\nC: Converts power from an energy source into work, like rotation or linear motion.\nD: Amplifies weak electrical signals from devices like microphones or sensors.\nA describes a controller, typically for closed-loop systems. B is a sensor\u0026rsquo;s job: turning physical quantities into electrical signals. C is what an actuator does. D is an amplifier. So, C is the correct choice.\nQuestion 8 第1、第2、第3正規形とリレーションの特徴 a, b, c の組合のうち、適切なものはどれか。\na：どの非キー属性も、主キーの真部分集合に対して関数従属しない。\nb：どの非キー属性も、主キーに推移的に関数従属しない。\nc：繰り返し属性が存在しない。\n第1正規形 第2正規形 第3正規形 ア a b c イ a c b ウ c a b エ c b a Question translation: Which combination correctly maps 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF to characteristics a, b, c?\na: No non-key attribute depends on a proper subset of the primary key (partial dependency).\nb: No non-key attribute transitively depends on the primary key via other non-key attributes (transitive dependency).\nc: No repeating attributes.\nYeah, these are just database normal forms (though \u0026lsquo;regular form\u0026rsquo; sounds a bit off). I even wrote a post about them . Checking the summary section , 1NF maps to c, 2NF to a, and 3NF to b. So, option C it is.\nQuestion 9 ビッグデータの利用におけるデータマイニングを説明したものはどれか。\nア　蓄積されたデータを分析し、単なる検索だけではわからない隠れた規則や相関関係を見つけ出すこと\nイ　データウェアハウスに格納されたデータの一部を、特定の用途や部門用に切り出して、データベースに格納すること\nウ　データ処理の対象となる情報を基に規定した、データの構造、意味及び操作の枠組みのこと\nエ　データを複数のサーバに複製し、性能と可用性を向上させること\nQuestion translation: Which statement describes data mining in big data scenarios?\nA: Analyzing accumulated data to uncover hidden patterns and correlations not visible through simple searches.\nB: Taking a subset of data from a data warehouse and storing it in a database for specific uses or departments.\nC: Defining data structure, meaning, and operational framework based on the information being processed.\nD: Replicating data to multiple servers to boost performance and availability.\nA correctly describes data mining. B describes a data mart: pulling specific data from a data warehouse for particular uses. C is a data model\u0026rsquo;s definition. D is data replication/backup. So, option A is the one.\nQuestion 10 UDPを使用しているものはどれか。\nア　FTP\nイ　NTP\nウ　POP３\nエ　TELNET\nQuestion translation: Which of these uses the UDP protocol?\nFTP (File Transfer Protocol) uses TCP for reliable data transfer. NTP (Network Time Protocol) uses UDP for speed. POP3 (Post Office Protocol v3) uses TCP for reliable email. TELNET (Remote Terminal Protocol) uses TCP for reliable remote sessions. So, option B is correct.\n","date":"2024-10-22T15:37:34+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/186/","title":"2022 SA am1 -06-10"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Introduction 2022 SA am1\n01-02: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/184 03-05: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/185 06-10: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/186 11-15: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/189 16-30: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/190 Ramblings Mondays are always a drag. After the weekend, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to get into the groove. But for some reason today, my mood suddenly flipped from feeling almost depressed to being super optimistic—even though I didn\u0026rsquo;t actually do anything. Emotions and mental states are weird.\nSo, I slacked off a bit today and almost skipped writing this. But this paper has 30 questions; at my current pace, it\u0026rsquo;s going to take at least half a month to finish. :cry:\nQuestion 3 ポログラム言語のうち、ブロックの範囲を指定する方法として特定の記号や予約語を用いず、等しい文字数の字下げを用いるという特征をもつものはどれか。\nア　C\nイ　Java\nウ　PHP\nエ　Python\nTranslation: Which programming language is characterized by using indentation of a specific number of characters to define the scope of a code block, rather than using specific symbols or reserved words?\nClearly Python, which is option エ.\nQuestion 4 キャッシュメモリのアクセス時間が主記憶のアクセス時間の1/30で、ヒット率が95％のとき、実効メモリアクセス時間は、主記憶のアクセス時間の約何と何倍になるか。\nア　0.03\nイ　0.08\nウ　0.37\nエ　0.95\nThis question tests Effective Memory Access Time (EMAT), calculated using the following formula:\n$$ EMAT = Cache Access Time \\times Hit Rate + Main Memory Access Time \\times Miss Rate $$Let Main Memory Access Time = $T$. Then Cache Access Time = $\\frac{T}{30}$. From the question, Hit Rate = 95%, so Miss Rate = 5%.\nSo, $EMAT = \\frac{T}{30} \\times 95\\% + T \\times 5\\% \\approx 0.08T$. The answer is option イ.\nTo be honest, I\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten most of my computer organization coursework, so I had to brush up on this.\nQuestion 5 プロセッサ数と、計算処理におけるプロセスの並列化が可能な部分の割合とが、性能上へ及ぼす影響に関する記述のうち、アムダールの法則に基づいたものはどれか。\nア　全ての計算処理が並列化できる場合、速度向上比は、プロセッサ数を増やしてもある水準に漸近的に近づく。\nイ　並列化できない計算処理がある場合、速度向上比は、プロセッサ数に比例して増加する。\nウ　並列化できない計算処理がある場合、速度向上比は、プロセッサ数を増やしてもある水準に漸近的に近づく。\nエ　並列化できる計算処理の割合が増えると、速度向上比は、プロセッサ数に反比例して減少する。\nTranslation: Regarding the impact of the number of processors and the proportion of parallelizable parts of a computation on performance, which description is based on Amdahl\u0026rsquo;s Law?\nア: If all computation can be parallelized, the speedup ratio will asymptotically approach a certain level even if the number of processors is increased.\nイ: If there is computation that cannot be parallelized, the speedup ratio increases proportionally with the number of processors.\nウ: If there is computation that cannot be parallelized, the speedup ratio will asymptotically approach a certain level even if the number of processors is increased.\nエ: As the proportion of parallelizable computation increases, the speedup ratio decreases in inverse proportion to the number of processors.\nTo solve this, you need to know Amdahl\u0026rsquo;s Law. It describes how the degree of parallelization in a program limits the performance gain from adding more processors. It states that the non-parallelizable portion of the program will eventually bottleneck the performance improvement. The formula is:\n$$ S(N)=\\frac{1}{(1-P)+\\frac{P}{N}} $$Where:\n$S(N)$ is the speedup ratio using $N$ processors. $P$ is the proportion of the program that can be parallelized. $N$ is the number of processors. Based on this, the answer is ウ.\n","date":"2024-10-21T20:35:34+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/185/","title":"2022 SA am1 -03-05"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Introduction 2022 SA am1\n01-02: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/184 03-05: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/185 06-10: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/186 11-15: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/189 16-30: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/190 So, regarding this article: I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to challenge myself by taking the System Architect exam—the advanced level of the Computer Technology and Software Professional Qualification. To be honest, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if I\u0026rsquo;ll pass. A lot of the knowledge required for this cert might not seem useful in day-to-day coding (actually, it is, we just don\u0026rsquo;t realize it), but having it is better than not. I\u0026rsquo;ll try my best to finish this past paper. Hopefully, this process helps snap me back into reality.\nRamblings I\u0026rsquo;ve been in a bit of a slump for the past two years, and it\u0026rsquo;s definitely affected how I handle things. I can\u0026rsquo;t keep going like this. Since I can\u0026rsquo;t change the past, I\u0026rsquo;ll just do my best with what\u0026rsquo;s ahead. I want to at least give it a shot; the scariest thing is losing the courage to try, which already cost me an opportunity recently. I need some change to feel like I\u0026rsquo;m actually \u0026ldquo;living\u0026rdquo; again. Sometimes it feels like I\u0026rsquo;m living in a dream—not a good one, just an unrealistic one. Words are limited; actual experience is more convincing, even if it\u0026rsquo;s a fabricated reality. I\u0026rsquo;m starting to believe some pretty far-fetched things.\nEmm, this feels like a diary entry. Oh well, it is what it is.\nThe mention of feeling like I\u0026rsquo;m in a dream reminds me of a cultivation novel where a member of a demonic sect believes they are an immortal, that the current world is just an illusion, and they are only there for a trial. Sometimes I feel like that setting has influenced me too. Anyway, enough nonsense.\nQuestion 1 A Hamming code is created by adding redundancy bits to data to allow for 1-bit error correction. Consider a Hamming code $X_1X_2X_3P_3X_4P_2P_1$ consisting of 4 bits of data $X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4$ and 3 redundancy bits $P_3, P_2, P_1$. The added bits $P_1, P_2, P_3$ are determined as follows:\n$$ X_1 \\oplus X_3 \\oplus X_4 \\oplus P_1 = 0 \\\\ X_1 \\oplus X_2 \\oplus X_4 \\oplus P_2 = 0 \\\\ X_1 \\oplus X_2 \\oplus X_3 \\oplus P_3 = 0 $$Where $\\oplus$ represents the XOR (exclusive OR) operation.\nThe Hamming code 1110011 contains a 1-bit error. Which of the following is the corrected Hamming code?\nA. 0110011\nB. 1010011\nC. 1100011\nD. 1110111\nThis is a Hamming code problem. The question provides the formulas. Substituting the values into the XOR equations:\n$$ X_1 \\oplus X_3 \\oplus X_4 \\oplus P_1 = 1 \\\\ X_1 \\oplus X_2 \\oplus X_4 \\oplus P_2 = 1 \\\\ X_1 \\oplus X_2 \\oplus X_3 \\oplus P_3 = 1 $$The result of the check is $(111)_2$, which indicates the error is at the 7th bit. Therefore, the correct data is 0110011, which corresponds to option A (ア).\nWhen I saw \u0026ldquo;Hamming code,\u0026rdquo; it felt familiar, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t remember the details. Man, what was I even studying before?\nHamming codes are used to detect and correct single-bit errors. For example, to convert the original data 1100 into a Hamming code:\nFirst, calculate the number of parity bits using $2^k \\ge k + m + 1$, where $m$ is the number of data bits and $k$ is the number of parity bits. In this case, $k$ should be 3. Parity bits are placed at positions $2^n$ (1, 2, 4, 8\u0026hellip;). So here, parity bits are at positions 1, 2, and 4. Position numbering usually goes from right to left.\nWith 3 parity bits and 4 data bits, there are 7 positions total. Let\u0026rsquo;s list their binary representations (3 bits):\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 111 110 101 100 011 010 001 The parity bit positions (1, 2, 4) correspond to 001, 010, and 100. This means position 1 tracks bits with a \u0026lsquo;1\u0026rsquo; in the first binary digit, position 2 tracks the second, and position 4 tracks the third.\nParity Bit Position \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo; bit location Covered Positions 1 1st bit, **1 1, 3, 5, 7 2 2nd bit, *1* 2, 3, 6, 7 4 3rd bit, 1** 4, 5, 6, 7 Now, determine the value of the parity bits based on the original data so that each group has an even number of 1s (even parity):\nPosition 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Value 1 1 0 0 (Leaving parity bits blank for now)\nGroup 1 (bits 1, 3, 5, 7): Contains one \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo;. Add 1 to make it even. Group 2 (bits 2, 3, 6, 7): Contains two \u0026ldquo;1\u0026quot;s. Add 0. Group 3 (bits 4, 5, 6, 7): Contains two \u0026ldquo;1\u0026quot;s. Add 0.\nThe resulting Hamming code is:\nPosition 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Value 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 So 1100 becomes 1100001. The verification process is the same as the question.\nTo check for errors: Perform the XOR check for each group. If the results are all 0, there\u0026rsquo;s no error. If not, the resulting binary number (Group 3, Group 2, Group 1) points to the position of the flipped bit.\nReferences:\nUnderstanding Hamming Codes Hamming Code Encoding and Verification Exclusive OR (XOR) Question 2 Lists can be implemented using either arrays or pointers. Which of the following is a characteristic of a list implemented using an array? Here, an array-based list stores elements contiguously, while a pointer-based list uses elements and pointers to the next element.\nA. Regardless of the actual number of elements, space for the maximum possible number of elements must be allocated, which may result in unused memory.\nB. To reference a middle element, you must traverse the list from the beginning, requiring time proportional to the number of elements.\nC. In addition to the space for storing elements, extra space is required to store pointers to the next element.\nD. If the insertion point is known, elements can be inserted in constant time regardless of the actual number of elements in the list.\nThis question asks about the characteristics of an array-based list implementation. Options B, C, and D are characteristics of linked lists (pointer-based). The correct answer is A.\nThe logic is straightforward; if I got it wrong, it\u0026rsquo;s only because I couldn\u0026rsquo;t read the Japanese :cry:. Here is the translation breakdown:\nA: Max size must be pre-allocated regardless of actual usage, leading to potential waste. (Array trait)\nB: Accessing an element requires O(n) traversal. (Linked list trait; arrays have O(1) random access)\nC: Requires extra space for pointers. (Linked list trait)\nD: Constant time insertion if the position is known. (Linked list trait; arrays require shifting elements, making it O(n))\n","date":"2024-10-20T20:19:11+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/184/","title":"2022 SA am1 -01-02"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Introduction I recently reinstalled my OS after swapping out some drives. When I pulled out my ancient setup USB drive, the software inside was pretty outdated—some wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even run on a modern system, and for others, I’ve found better alternatives. I\u0026rsquo;m writing this article to document the software I used for this 2024 build.\nLooking back, I actually started this on 2024.09.16. Life got in the way, and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t in the best state, so it took until 2024.10.02 to finally finish this post.\nSystem Since I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Windows 11 for a while, I decided to stick with it. My USB image was too old, so I downloaded a fresh one from MSDN itellyou .\nHowever, I discovered that Windows now forces an internet connection during setup—you\u0026rsquo;re basically required to log in with a Microsoft account. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have internet, it\u0026rsquo;s best to use an older version (which might still allow skipping) or install Win10 first and then upgrade (lol).\n2024.10.03\nToday I came across two methods to skip network verification . Haven\u0026rsquo;t tried them yet, but documenting them here:\nPress Ctrl+Shift+F3 to skip directly and avoid creating a local user (the setup will restart on the next reboot). On the network connection screen, press Shift+F10 and enter oobe\\bypassnro.cmd. The system will reboot, and an \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t have internet\u0026rdquo; option will appear. Software My setup drive hadn\u0026rsquo;t been touched in ages. Some apps are no longer in my workflow, and I\u0026rsquo;ve adopted new ones that replace old functionality. It\u0026rsquo;s worth documenting this; who knows if I\u0026rsquo;ll have a completely different set of tools the next time I reinstall (though I\u0026rsquo;m starting to prefer keeping things simple).\nOffice Suite Basic Office is essential. I use Office Tool Plus for a quick and clean installation.\nI only install Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.\nDownload Office Tool: https://otp.landian.vip/zh-cn/download.html Launch Office Tool and run this code to install:\n1 deploy /add O365ProPlusRetail_zh-cn /O365ProPlusRetail.exclapps Access,Bing,Groove,Lync,OneDrive,OneNote,Outlook,Publisher,Teams /channel Current /dlfirst Activate Office using KMS:\n1 2 3 ospp /inslicid MondoVolume /sethst:kms.loli.beer /setprt:1688 /act # or use kms.03k.org ospp /inslicid MondoVolume /sethst:kms.03k.org /setprt:1688 /act References:\nhttps://www.coolhub.top/archives/11 https://www.coolhub.top/archives/14 Download Tools \u0026amp; Cloud Storage Thunder (迅雷): Using a lite version I found somewhere. It\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;leech\u0026rdquo; client, but it\u0026rsquo;s still necessary for some specific downloads.\nBitComet: BitTorrent client, also using a lite version. Alternatives include qBittorrent, µTorrent, etc.\nResilio Sync : P2P-based sync software, great for keeping files synced across devices.\nInternet Download Manager (IDM): The gold standard for multi-threaded downloads.\n115 : Good for downloading stubborn BT links.

NanaZip : A stylized 7zip that integrates into the Windows 11 primary context menu. Miscellaneous Tools uTools : An extremely convenient productivity tool. It uses plugins to expand functionality. In fact, I wrote this post using its Markdown extension—not quite Typora, but very handy.\nQuickLook : Quick file preview tool. It\u0026rsquo;s not perfect; I\u0026rsquo;m looking for a better alternative. The portable version requires a workaround: https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook/issues/1 1Password : Password manager. An open-source alternative is Bitwarden . I can\u0026rsquo;t live without a password manager anymore.\nPDF Readers: Most are similar, I use whatever\u0026rsquo;s handy:\nFoxit PDF Wondershare PDFelement PDF X-Change Sandboxie Plus : Great for running apps without cluttering the system. The portable version requires admin rights every time.\nTickTick : To-Do list with cross-platform sync. Sync has felt a bit sluggish lately, though.\nQuiteRSS : RSS feed manager. The UI is dated, but I\u0026rsquo;m used to it. Since it\u0026rsquo;s portable, moving my feeds is just a matter of copy-paste.\nDuplicate Cleaner Pro: Couldn\u0026rsquo;t find my old cleaner, so I\u0026rsquo;m using Bajian\u0026rsquo;s version. It takes some getting used to, but it works.\nPixPin : Screenshot tool.\nCode Tools VS Code : Essential.\nTypora : The best Markdown editor.\nGit: https://git-scm.com/downloads/win Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to config your name and email after installing. Time to update the GitHub SSH keys too.\n1 2 git config --global user.name \u0026#34;Your Name\u0026#34; git config --global user.email \u0026#34;email@example.com\u0026#34; Reference: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/95 JetBrains:\nIntelliJ IDEA : Java dev.

This means no two queens can be in the same row, same column, or on the same diagonal (following standard chess queen movement rules).\nProblem Analysis We can solve the n-Queens problem using the following approach:\nPlace the $i$-th queen in the $i$-th row. Starting from the first queen, try each column in its corresponding row (the $i$-th queen corresponds to the $i$-th row) starting from the first column. If a position is valid (no attacks), place the queen and move to the next queen. If it conflicts with existing queens, try the next column. If all columns in the current row are exhausted, backtrack to the previous queen and move it to its next possible column.

It worked fine over HTTP. Since my previous non-Docker deployment didn\u0026rsquo;t have this issue, I initially suspected a Docker networking problem. At the time, I only needed to make a one-off update, so I just disabled HTTPS, finished the changes, and left it. Now that I\u0026rsquo;m using Typecho again and need to post regularly, it\u0026rsquo;s time to fix it properly.\nSolution The fix is straightforward. Add the following line to the end of your data/config.inc.php file:\n1 define(\u0026#39;__TYPECHO_SECURE__\u0026#39;, true); Then, restart the service.\nRoot Cause Analysis According to the reference materials, the issue stems from the interaction between the user, the browser, and the server. While the browser communicates with a proxy (like Cloudflare) via HTTPS, PHP receives an HTTP request from the proxy. PHP then responds using HTTP, which causes the login failure.\nReferences Typecho HTTPS 无法登陆后台 ","date":"2024-07-26T22:22:22+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/175/","title":"Cannot Login to Typecho Admin via HTTPS"},{"content":"introduction Graduation thesis is really torture.

It handles the following:\nAuthentication and Authorization: As the microservice entry, the gateway verifies if a user is authorized to make a request. If not, it blocks the request. Request Routing, Load Balancing: All requests must pass through the gateway first. The gateway doesn\u0026rsquo;t handle business logic directly. Instead, it forwards requests to a specific microservice based on defined rules – that\u0026rsquo;s routing. If multiple target services are available for a route, load balancing is also applied. Request Rate Limiting: When traffic is too high, the gateway throttles requests to match the downstream microservice\u0026rsquo;s capacity, preventing services from getting overloaded. Spring Cloud offers two gateway implementations:\nZuul: Built on Servlet, uses blocking I/O. SpringCloudGateway: Based on Spring5\u0026rsquo;s WebFlux, it\u0026rsquo;s a reactive programming implementation with better performance.

Any path starting with /user/ will match. Then, visit localhost:10010/user/1 to test it.\nRouting configuration includes:\nRoute ID: The unique identifier for the route. Route Target (URI): The target address for the route. \u0026lsquo;http\u0026rsquo; means a fixed address, \u0026rsquo;lb\u0026rsquo; means load balancing based on service name. Route Predicates: Rules that determine if a request matches the route. If it matches, the request is forwarded to the route\u0026rsquo;s destination. Route Filters: Process requests or responses. Predicate Factories The predicate rules defined in the configuration are just strings. These strings are read and processed by Predicate Factories, turning them into conditions for route matching.\nFor example, the Path=/user/** rule from above matches by path and is handled by the org.springframework.cloud.gateway.handler.predicate.PathRoutePredicateFactory class. Similar predicate factories include:\nName Description Example After Requests after a certain time - After=2037-01-20T17:42:47.789-07:00[America/Denver] Before Requests before a certain time - Before=2031-04-13T15:14:47.433+08:00[Asia/Shanghai] Between Requests between two specific times - Between=2037-01-20T17:42:47.789-07:00[America/Denver], 2037-01-21T17:42:47.789-07:00[America/Denver] Cookie Request must include certain cookies - Cookie=chocolate, ch.p Header Request must include certain headers - Header=X-Request-Id, \\d+ Host Request must be for a specific host (domain) - Host=.somehost.org,.anotherhost.org Method Request method must be specified - Method=GET,POST Path Request path must match specified rules - Path=/red/{segment},/blue/** Query Request parameters must include specified parameters - Query=name, Jack or - Query=name RemoteAddr Requester\u0026rsquo;s IP must be within a specified range - RemoteAddr=192.168.1.1/24 Weight Weight handling Filter Factories A GatewayFilter is a type of filter provided in the gateway that can process requests entering the gateway and responses returned by microservices.\nSpring provides 31 different route filter factories, for example:\nName Description AddRequestHeader Adds a request header to the current request RemoveRequestHeader Removes a request header from the request AddResponseHeader Adds a response header to the response RemoveResponseHeader Removes a response header from the response RequestRateLimiter Limits request traffic For more details, see: https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-gateway/reference/spring-cloud-gateway/gatewayfilter-factories.html Request Header Filter Let\u0026rsquo;s take the request header filter as an example: add a request header \u0026lsquo;Hello=World\u0026rsquo; to all requests going to \u0026lsquo;userService\u0026rsquo;.\nModify application.yml in your gateway project to add a route filter:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 spring: cloud: gateway: routes: - id: user-service uri: lb://userservice predicates: - Path=/user/** filters: # Filters - AddRequestHeader=Hello, World # Add request header Then, you can modify the Controller to test it:\n1 2 3 4 5 @GetMapping(\u0026#34;/{id}\u0026#34;) public User queryById(@PathVariable(\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;) Long id, @RequestHeader(\u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;) String hello) { System.out.println(hello); return userService.queryById(id); } Default Filters If you want a filter factory to apply to all routes, you can put it under \u0026lsquo;default-filters\u0026rsquo;.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 spring: cloud: gateway: routes: - id: user-service uri: lb://userservice predicates: - Path=/user/** default-filters: # Default filter items - AddRequestHeader=Hello, World Global Filters The gateway provides 31 types of filters, but each has a fixed purpose. If we want to intercept requests and implement our own custom business logic, these fixed filters won\u0026rsquo;t cut it.\nGlobal Filters, on the other hand, also process all requests entering the gateway and responses from microservices, just like GatewayFilters. The difference is that GatewayFilters are configuration-driven with fixed logic, while GlobalFilter logic requires custom code by implementing the GlobalFilter interface.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 public interface GlobalFilter { /** * Processes the current request. If necessary, it passes the request to the next filter via {@link GatewayFilterChain}. * * @param exchange The request context, where you can get Request, Response, and other info. * @param chain Used to delegate the request to the next filter. * @return {@code Mono\u0026lt;Void\u0026gt;} Returns to indicate the current filter\u0026#39;s business logic is complete. */ Mono\u0026lt;Void\u0026gt; filter(ServerWebExchange exchange, GatewayFilterChain chain); } By writing custom logic in the filter, you can achieve the following functionalities:\nLogin status check Permission validation Request rate limiting, etc. Basic Usage Goal: Define a global filter to intercept requests and check if the request parameters meet the following conditions:\nDoes the parameter contain \u0026lsquo;authorization\u0026rsquo;? Is the \u0026lsquo;authorization\u0026rsquo; parameter value \u0026lsquo;admin\u0026rsquo;? If both conditions are met, proceed; otherwise, block the request.\nFirst, define a filter in the gateway:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 @Order(-1) // Process first @Component public class AuthorizeFilter implements GlobalFilter { @Override public Mono\u0026lt;Void\u0026gt; filter(ServerWebExchange exchange, GatewayFilterChain chain) { // Get request parameters MultiValueMap\u0026lt;String, String\u0026gt; params = exchange.getRequest().getQueryParams(); // Get the \u0026#39;AuthorizeFilter\u0026#39; parameter. Here, we assume the first one is the authentication parameter. String authorize = params.getFirst(\u0026#34;AuthorizeFilter\u0026#34;); // Check if(\u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;.equals(authorize)){ // Proceed return chain.filter(exchange); } // Intercept, forbid access exchange.getResponse().setStatusCode(HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN); // Finish processing return exchange.getResponse().setComplete(); } } Filter Execution Order When a request enters the gateway, it encounters three types of filters: current route filters, Default Filters, and Global Filters.\nAfter routing, the current route filters, Default Filters, and Global Filters are merged into a single filter chain (collection). They are then sorted and executed sequentially.\nEach filter has an integer \u0026lsquo;order\u0026rsquo; value. A smaller \u0026lsquo;order\u0026rsquo; value means higher priority and earlier execution.\nThe \u0026lsquo;order\u0026rsquo; values for route filters and default filters are assigned by Spring, defaulting to an incrementing sequence starting from 1.\nGlobalFilters can specify their \u0026lsquo;order\u0026rsquo; value by implementing the \u0026lsquo;Ordered\u0026rsquo; interface or by adding the \u0026lsquo;@Order\u0026rsquo; annotation. We define these values.\nIf filters have the same \u0026lsquo;order\u0026rsquo; value, they are executed in the sequence: DefaultFilter \u0026gt; Route Filter \u0026gt; GlobalFilter.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how to specify the order value by implementing an interface:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 //@Order(-1) // Process first @Component public class AuthorizeFilter implements GlobalFilter, Ordered { @Override public Mono\u0026lt;Void\u0026gt; filter(ServerWebExchange exchange, GatewayFilterChain chain) { // Get request parameters MultiValueMap\u0026lt;String, String\u0026gt; params = exchange.getRequest().getQueryParams(); // Get the \u0026#39;AuthorizeFilter\u0026#39; parameter.

Populate user info order.setUser(user); // 4. Return return order; } } Custom Configuration Feign allows custom configurations to override defaults. Key configurations include:\nType Function Description feign.Logger.Level Modify log level Four levels: NONE, BASIC, HEADERS, FULL feign.codec.Decoder Response decoder Parses HTTP call results, e.g., JSON string to Java object feign.codec.Encoder Request encoder Encodes request parameters for HTTP transmission feign. Contract Annotation format Defaults to SpringMVC annotations feign. Retryer Retry mechanism Retry logic for failed requests; default is none, but uses Ribbon\u0026rsquo;s retry Usually, you only need to configure the log level. Levels include:\nNONE: No logging (default). BASIC: Logs only the request method, URL, response status code, and execution time. HEADERS: BASIC plus request and response headers. FULL: Logs everything—headers, body, and metadata for both request and response. There are two ways to configure this: via configuration files or by creating a Bean.\nConfiguration File For a specific service:\n1 2 3 4 5 feign: client: config: userservice: # Target microservice loggerLevel: FULL # Log level Global configuration for all services:\n1 2 3 4 5 feign: client: config: default: # \u0026#39;default\u0026#39; applies globally loggerLevel: FULL # Log level Bean Configuration First, define a configuration class and declare a Logger.Level Bean:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 public class DefaultFeignConfiguration { @Bean public Logger.Level feignLogLevel(){ return Logger.Level.BASIC; // Set level to BASIC } } To apply it globally, add it to the @EnableFeignClients annotation in the startup class:\n1 @EnableFeignClients(defaultConfiguration = DefaultFeignConfiguration .class) To apply it to a specific service, add it to the @FeignClient annotation:\n1 @FeignClient(value = \u0026#34;userService\u0026#34;, configuration = DefaultFeignConfiguration .class) Feign Optimization Feign\u0026rsquo;s underlying HTTP client implementations:\nURLConnection: Default, no connection pooling. Apache HttpClient: Supports connection pooling. OKHttp: Supports connection pooling. Using a connection pool improves performance. Here is how to switch to HttpClient:\nAdd the dependency: 1 2 3 4 5 \u0026lt;!-- HttpClient dependency --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;io.github.openfeign\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;feign-httpclient\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; Configure the connection pool: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 feign: client: config: default: # Global config loggerLevel: BASIC # Use BASIC for essential request/response info httpclient: enabled: true # Enable HttpClient support max-connections: 200 # Max total connections max-connections-per-route: 50 # Max connections per route Best Practices Best practices are optimized approaches based on common usage patterns.\nThe Feign client code often mirrors the provider\u0026rsquo;s controller:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 // Feign Client @FeignClient(\u0026#34;userService\u0026#34;) public interface UserClient { @GetMapping(\u0026#34;/user/{id}\u0026#34;) User findById(@PathVariable(\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;) Long id); } // Controller @GetMapping(\u0026#34;/user/{id}\u0026#34;) public User queryById(@PathVariable(\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;) Long id) { return userService.queryById(id); } There are two ways to simplify this duplication:\nMethod 1: Inheritance Define a common interface for both the consumer\u0026rsquo;s FeignClient and the provider\u0026rsquo;s Controller.\nDefine the interface:\n1 2 3 4 public interface UserAPI{ @GetMapping(\u0026#34;/user/{id}\u0026#34;) User findById(@PathVariable(\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;) Long id); } Feign Client implementation:\n1 2 @FeignClient(value=\u0026#34;userService\u0026#34;) public interface UserClient extends UserAPI{} Controller implementation:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 @RestController public class UserController implements UserAPI{ public User findById(@PathVariable(\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;) Long id){ // implementation logic } } Pros: Simple and achieves code sharing.\nCons:\nTight coupling between provider and consumer. Annotation mapping in parameter lists doesn\u0026rsquo;t inherit; you must redeclare methods, parameters, and annotations in the Controller. Method 2: Extraction (Modularization) Extract FeignClient into a standalone module. Place the interface, related POJOs, and default Feign configurations in this module for all consumers to use.\nCreate a new project and add the Feign starter dependency:\n1 2 3 4 \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.cloud\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-cloud-starter-openfeign\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; Import this feign-api dependency into the consumer project.\nIf the defined FeignClient is outside the scanning range of the SpringBootApplication, it won\u0026rsquo;t be picked up. Fix this in two ways:\nSpecify the package to scan: 1 @EnableFeignClients(basePackages = \u0026#34;net.yexca.feign.clients\u0026#34;) Specify the specific client classes to load: 1 @EnableFeignClients(clients = {UserClient.class}) ","date":"2024-05-03T23:11:52+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/170/","title":"Feign Remote Calls"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Install the software first.

The default username and password are both nacos.\nTiered Storage Model Services are divided into multiple clusters, each containing multiple instances. Clusters can be assigned by region to improve access speed.\nIn contrast, Eureka only has a Service-Instance model without clusters.\nService calls should prioritize the local cluster to avoid high latency. If the local cluster is unavailable, Nacos will fail over to other clusters.\nYou can set the cluster in application.yml:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 spring: cloud: nacos: server-addr: localhost:8848 discovery: cluster-name: Shanghai # Cluster name Then set the Ribbon strategy to Nacos\u0026rsquo;s strategy:\n1 2 3 4 5 # Configure load balancing rules for a specific microservice, here it\u0026#39;s userService userService: ribbon: NFLoadBalancerRuleClassName: com.alibaba.cloud.nacos.ribbon.NacosRule # NFLoadBalancerRuleClassName: com.netflix.loadbalancer.Nac # Load balancing rule You can also set the instance weight (0-1) in the Nacos console. Higher weight means higher access frequency.\nEnvironment Isolation The outermost layer for service and data storage in Nacos is the namespace, which is used for top-level isolation.\nYou can create a new namespace in Nacos, such as dev, and then update application.yml:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 spring: cloud: nacos: server-addr: localhost:8848 discovery: cluster-name: Shanghai # Cluster name namespace: UUID # The UUID of the namespace Services in different namespaces are invisible to each other and cannot be accessed.\nEphemeral vs. Non-ephemeral Instances For ephemeral instances, Nacos handles them the same way as Eureka (heartbeats).\nFor non-ephemeral instances, Nacos actively probes the service for health. The service is not deleted if it becomes unavailable, and Nacos will actively notify consumers about the failure.\nSet an instance as non-ephemeral:\n1 2 3 4 5 spring: cloud: nacos: discovery: ephemeral: false # Set as non-ephemeral Nacos Configuration Management As the number of microservice instances grows, changing configurations one by one becomes tedious. Nacos allows for centralized configuration management with hot updates.\nBasic Usage In the Nacos console\u0026rsquo;s Configuration Management, create a new configuration. The Data ID is the config file ID, formatted as [service-name]-[profile].[extension], e.g., userService-dev.yaml.\nThen write the configuration content:\n1 2 pattern: dateformat: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss Add the Nacos configuration management client dependency:\n1 2 3 4 5 \u0026lt;!--nacos configuration management dependency--\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;com.alibaba.cloud\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-cloud-starter-alibaba-nacos-config\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; Configuration retrieval steps:\nApp Start -\u0026gt; bootstrap.yml -\u0026gt; Nacos config file -\u0026gt; Local application.yml -\u0026gt; Create Spring Container -\u0026gt; Load beans\nAdd bootstrap.yml:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 spring: application: name: userService # Service name profiles: active: dev # Active profile cloud: nacos: server-addr: localhost:8848 # Nacos address config: file-extension: yaml # File extension Testing:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 @RestController @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/user\u0026#34;) public class UserController{ @Value(\u0026#34;${pattern.dateformat}\u0026#34;) private String dateformat; @GetMapping(\u0026#34;/now\u0026#34;) public String now(){ return LocalDateTime.now().format(DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(dateformat)); } } Check the page to see the effect.\nHot Updates This can be achieved in two ways:\nMethod 1: Add the @RefreshScope annotation to the class where the @Value is injected.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 @RefreshScope // Enable automatic configuration refresh @RestController @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/user\u0026#34;) public class UserController{ @Value(\u0026#34;${pattern.dateformat}\u0026#34;) private String dateformat; @GetMapping(\u0026#34;/now\u0026#34;) public String now(){ return LocalDateTime.now().format(DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(dateformat)); } } Method 2: Use @ConfigurationProperties.\nCreate a configuration class:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 @Component @Data @ConfigurationProperties(prefix = \u0026#34;pattern\u0026#34;) public class PatternProperties { private String dateformat; } Controller class:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 // @RefreshScope // Not needed with @ConfigurationProperties @RestController @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/user\u0026#34;) public class UserController{ @Autowired private PatternProperties properties; @GetMapping(\u0026#34;/now\u0026#34;) public String now(){ return LocalDateTime.now().format(DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(properties.getDateformat())); } } Shared Configuration When a microservice starts, it reads multiple configuration files from Nacos:\n[spring.application.name]-[spring.profiles.active].yaml, e.g., userService-dev.yaml [spring.application.name].yaml, e.g., userService.yaml The second one ([spring.application.name].yaml) does not include the environment profile and can be shared across multiple environments.\nConfiguration priority: [spring.application.name]-[spring.profiles.active].yaml \u0026gt; [spring.application.name].yaml \u0026gt; Local configuration.\n","date":"2024-05-02T22:36:17+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/169/","title":"Nacos Service Registry"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview When a consumer initiates a request, it\u0026rsquo;s intercepted by Ribbon.

Uses Zones to categorize servers (e.g., a data center or a rack) and then performs round-robin within the Zone. RoundRobinRule Simple round-robin through the service list. This is the default Ribbon rule. AvailabilityFilteringRule Ignores the following two types of servers: (1) By default, if a connection fails 3 times, the server is set to a \u0026ldquo;short-circuit\u0026rdquo; state for 30 seconds. If it fails again, the duration increases exponentially.(2) Servers with high concurrency. Clients configured with this rule will ignore servers where the active connection count is too high. The upper limit can be configured via \u0026lt;clientName\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;clientConfigNameSpace\u0026gt;.ActiveConnectionsLimit. WeightedResponseTimeRule Assigns a weight to each server. The longer the response time, the lower the weight. Servers are chosen randomly, but the weight influences the selection probability. BestAvailableRule Ignores \u0026ldquo;short-circuited\u0026rdquo; servers and picks the one with the lowest concurrent connection count. RandomRule Randomly picks an available server. RetryRule Selection logic with a retry mechanism. Using the Random Strategy You can modify the load balancing rule by defining an IRule implementation. There are two ways to do this:\nCode Method: Define a new IRule in a configuration class (Global setting). 1 2 3 4 @Bean public IRule randomRule(){ return new RandomRule(); } Configuration File Method: Add configuration to the application.yml of the consumer (e.g., orderServer) to modify the rule for a specific service. 1 2 3 userService: # Configure load balancing for a specific microservice ribbon: NFLoadBalancerRuleClassName: com.netflix.loadbalancer.RandomRule # Load balancing rule Eager Loading Ribbon uses lazy loading by default, meaning it creates the LoadBalanceClient only during the first access.

Consumers then pull this provider info from Eureka to perform remote calls. Microservices send a heartbeat to Eureka every 30 seconds to confirm they are still alive. Eureka updates its service list accordingly and evicts unhealthy instances.\nIf multiple service providers are available, the consumer uses a load-balancing algorithm to pick one from the list.\nSetup Create a new Maven Module and add the dependency:\n1 2 3 4 \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.cloud\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; Create the startup class:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 @EnableEurekaServer @SpringBootApplication public class EurekaApplication { public static void main(String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(EurekaApplication.class,args); } } Configuration file:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 server: port: 7995 spring: application: name: eureka-server eureka: client: service-url: defaultZone: http://127.0.0.1:7995/eureka Service Registration Add the dependency:\n1 2 3 4 \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.cloud\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; Add configuration:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 spring: application: name: userService eureka: client: service-url: defaultZone: http://127.0.0.1:7995/eureka Usage Register the bean:\n1 2 3 4 5 @Bean @LoadBalanced public RestTemplate restTemplate(){ return new RestTemplate(); } Change the target URL from a hardcoded hostname to the service name:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 @Service public class OrderService { @Autowired private OrderMapper orderMapper; @Autowired private RestTemplate restTemplate; public Order queryOrderById(Long orderId) { // 1.

Appending may increase the slice\u0026rsquo;s capacity.\nYou can define a slice by declaring an array without specifying its size:\n1 2 3 var name []type // Example var s []int Or use the make() function to create a slice:\n1 2 3 var slice []type = make([]type, len) // len is the initial length // Or the shorthand slice := make([]type, len) You can use the optional capacity parameter to specify capacity. If omitted, it defaults to the length.\n1 var slice []type = make([]type, length, capacity) Slice Initialization Direct initialization:\n1 s := []int {1, 2, 3} Initialize a slice from an array, from startIndex to endIndex-1. Both values are optional.\n1 s := arr[startIndex:endIndex] Omitting startIndex defaults to the first element; omitting endIndex goes to the last element.\nlen() and cap() Slices are indexable. Use len() to get the current length.\ncap() calculates the capacity, measuring the maximum size the slice can reach.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 package main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; // Slices are passed by reference; modifications inside affect original data func printSlice(slice []int) { fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;len=%d, cap=%d, slice=%v\u0026#34;, len(slice), cap(slice), slice) } func main() { s := make([]int, 3, 5) printSlice(s) } /* * Output: * len=3, cap=5, slice=[0 0 0] */ Nil Slices An uninitialized slice defaults to nil (nil slice) with a length of 0.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 package main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func printSlice(slice []int) { fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;len=%d, cap=%d, slice=%v\\n\u0026#34;, len(slice), cap(slice), slice) } func main() { var s []int printSlice(s) // Check if nil if s == nil { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;slice is empty\u0026#34;) } } Slice Slicing Slice a slice by setting lower and upper bounds.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 package main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func printSlice(slice []int) { fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;len=%d, cap=%d, slice=%v\\n\u0026#34;, len(slice), cap(slice), slice) } func main() { s := []int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} // Print original slice fmt.Println(s) // From index 2 (inclusive) to 5 (exclusive) printSlice(s[2:5]) // From start to 5 (exclusive) printSlice(s[:5]) // From index 2 to end printSlice(s[2:]) // This assignment means modifying subS will affect s subS := s[1:6] printSlice(subS) } append() and copy() Increasing slice capacity and copying slices.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 package main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func printSlice(slice []int) { fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;len=%d, cap=%d, slice=%v\\n\u0026#34;, len(slice), cap(slice), slice) } func main() { var s []int printSlice(s) // Add one element s = append(s, 0) printSlice(s) // Add multiple elements s = append(s, 1, 2, 3, 4) printSlice(s) // Create s2 with twice the capacity of s s2 := make([]int, len(s), cap(s)*2) // Copy s to s2.

The writing style is different from my current one, and it feels a bit strange to read.\nUsing the crontab command, we can execute specified system commands or shell scripts at fixed intervals. The interval units can be any combination of minutes, hours, days, months, and weeks.\nCommand Format 1 crontab [-u user] file crontab [-u user] [ -e | -l | -r ] Command Parameters -u user: Used to set the crontab service for a specific user. file: The name of the command file. This loads the file as the crontab task list. If no file is specified, crontab accepts input from stdin (keyboard). -e: Edit the crontab file for a user. Defaults to the current user. -l: Display the contents of the crontab file. Defaults to the current user. -r: Remove a user\u0026rsquo;s crontab file from the /var/spool/cron directory. Defaults to the current user. -i: Prompt for confirmation before deleting the crontab file. File Format Executing crontab -e opens the current user\u0026rsquo;s crontab file. In this file, lines starting with # are comments.\nTasks are set using six fields: m h dom mon dow command. Each line represents one task. The fields are defined as follows:\nm: Minute (0-59) Specifies which minute of the hour to run the task.\nh: Hour (0-23) Specifies which hour of the day to run the task.\ndom: Day of Month (1-31) Specifies which day of the month to run the task.\nmon: Month (1-12) Specifies which month of the year to run the task. You can also use the first three letters of the month (case-insensitive), e.g., jan for January.\ndow: Day of Week (0-7) Specifies which day of the week to run the task. Both 0 and 7 represent Sunday. You can also use the first three letters of the day (case-insensitive), e.g., mon for Monday.\ncommand: The operation to execute The specific command or script path to run.\nFields must be separated by spaces. Every field requires a value. Everything after the fifth field is considered part of the command field.\nThe first five fields can use special characters:\nAsterisk (*): Represents all possible values. For example, a * in the month field means the command runs every month. Comma (,): Specifies a list of values, e.g., 1,2,5,7,8,9. Hyphen (-): Specifies a range of values, e.g., 2-6 means 2,3,4,5,6. Slash (/): Specifies frequency/intervals. For example, 0-23/2 in the hour field means every two hours. */10 in the minute field means every ten minutes. In the command field, you can use newline characters or the % character to separate command content.\nContent before the first % is passed to the shell. The % itself is replaced by a newline, and all content after it is passed as standard input.\nTo use a literal % character, escape it with a backslash: \\%.\nCommon Usage Before submitting a crontab file, set the EDITOR environment variable. The cron process uses this to determine which editor to open.\nThe default nano editor can be clunky for some. To use vi, edit your .profile in the $HOME directory and add:\n1 EDITOR=vi; export EDITOR Save and exit. You can create a file named \u0026lt;user\u0026gt;cron (e.g., yexcacron) and add your tasks:\n1 2 # echo the date to the console every 15 minutes between 6pm and 6am 0,15,30,45 18-06 * * * /bin/echo \u0026#39;date\u0026#39; \u0026gt; /dev/console In this example, the system outputs the current time to the console every 15 minutes. If the system hangs, you can tell when it stopped by looking at the last timestamp. (Note: some systems use tty1 for the console). To submit this file to cron, use it as an argument:\n1 crontab yexcacron The file is now submitted and will run every 15 minutes. A copy is stored in /var/spool/cron named after your username (e.g., yexca).\nExecuting Scripts If your script requires environment variables:\n1 30 6 * * * . /etc/profile;/bin/sh /root/zfile/bin/restart.sh The above runs the zfile restart.sh script every day at 6:30 AM.\nReferences crontab 定时任务 — Linux Tools Quick Tutorial Linux技巧：介绍设置定时周期执行任务的方法 - SegmentFault Linux命令之Crontab——定时任务 - SegmentFault nano编辑器使用教程 - VPS侦探 Linux vi/vim - 菜鸟教程 ","date":"2024-02-26T21:34:15+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/159/","title":"Linux Scheduled Tasks: crontab"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Service Architecture Monolithic Architecture All business functions are integrated into a single project, packaged as one unit for deployment.\nPros: Simple architecture, low deployment cost. Good for small projects.\nCons: High coupling. Poor scalability.\nDistributed Architecture Split the system based on business functions. Each module is developed as an independent project, called a \u0026ldquo;service.\u0026rdquo;\nPros: Reduced coupling, easier to upgrade and scale.\nCons: Complex architecture, high difficulty. Suitable for large-scale internet projects.\nMicroservices Microservices is a well-designed distributed architecture pattern. Key characteristics:\nSingle Responsibility : Fine-grained service splitting. Each service corresponds to a unique business capability to avoid redundant development. Service-Oriented: Services expose business interfaces to the outside. Autonomous: Independent teams, tech stacks, data, and deployment. Strong Isolation: Implement isolation, fault tolerance, and fallbacks for service calls to prevent cascading failures. Microservice Technologies Implementing a microservice solution requires a technical framework. Common ones include:\nDubbo SpringCloud SpringCloudAlibaba Service Registry zookeeper, Redis Eureka, Consul Nacos, Eureka Remote Call Dubbo protocol Feign (HTTP protocol) Dubbo, Feign Config Center None SpringCloudConfig SpringCloudConfig, Nacos API Gateway None SpringCloudGateway, Zuul SpringCloudGateway, Zuul Monitoring/Protection dubbo-admin (limited) Hystix Sentinel Microservices should be split according to business modules:\nSingle Responsibility: Don\u0026rsquo;t duplicate the same business logic in different services. Data Independence: Do not directly access other services\u0026rsquo; databases. Service-Oriented: Expose your business logic as interfaces for other services to call. SpringCloud SpringCloud is currently the most widely used microservice framework. It integrates various microservice components and implements auto-configuration based on SpringBoot.\nOfficial Website: https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud/ Service Registration \u0026amp; Discovery: Eureka, Nacos, Consul Unified Configuration Management: SpringCloudConfig, Nacos Remote Service Calls: OpenFeign, Dubbo Unified Gateway Routing: SpringCloudGateway, Zuul Distributed Tracing: Zipkin, Sleuth Flow Control, Fallback, \u0026amp; Protection: Hystix, Sentinel Microservice Calls Requirement: When querying an order by ID, return the associated user information as well.\nRegister RestTemplate 1 2 3 4 @Bean public RestTemplate restTemplate(){ return new RestTemplate(); } Remote Service Call with RestTemplate 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 @Service public class OrderService { @Autowired private OrderMapper orderMapper; @Autowired private RestTemplate restTemplate; public Order queryOrderById(Long orderId) { // 1.

Even if a package is imported by multiple packages, it is only imported once. Here is the execution order:\nExample:\nAssume the following structure:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 hello -- InitLib1 -- lib1.go -- InitLib2 -- lib2.go main.go Contents:\nlib1.go\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 package InitLib1 import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func init() { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;lib1 init\u0026#34;) } lib2.go\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 package InitLib2 import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func init() { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;lib2 init\u0026#34;) } main.go\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; // Using an underscore as an alias allows anonymous importing; // without it, importing without usage fails compilation. _ \u0026#34;hello/InitLib1\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;hello/InitLib2\u0026#34; ) func init() { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;main init\u0026#34;) } func main() { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;main\u0026#34;) } Execution result:\n1 2 3 4 lib1 init lib2 init main init main Now, import Lib2 into Lib1, keeping the main code the same:\nlib1.go\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 package InitLib1 import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;hello/InitLib2\u0026#34; ) func init() { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;lib1 init\u0026#34;) } Running main results in:\n1 2 3 4 lib2 init lib1 init main init main Notice lib2 only initializes once.\nCalling Functions from Other Packages In the previous example, _ was used as an anonymous alias, meaning you couldn\u0026rsquo;t call methods from that package.\nAdd a function to lib1:\nlib1.go\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 package InitLib1 import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; //_ \u0026#34;hello/InitLib2\u0026#34; ) // Functions must start with a capital letter to be exported. func Lib1Test() { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;lib1 test\u0026#34;) } func init() { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;lib1 init\u0026#34;) } main.go\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; // Alias the package mylib1 \u0026#34;hello/InitLib1\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;hello/InitLib2\u0026#34; ) func main() { // Call via alias.Method mylib1.Lib1Test() fmt.Println(\u0026#34;main\u0026#34;) } /* * Output * lib1 init * lib2 init * lib1 test * main */ Alternatively, you can use ., in main.go:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; // Change alias to . . \u0026#34;hello/InitLib1\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;hello/InitLib2\u0026#34; ) func main() { // Use directly Lib1Test() fmt.Println(\u0026#34;main\u0026#34;) } Not recommended; it creates ambiguity if two packages have functions with the same name.\nPointers Similar to C pointers.\nParameters can be passed by value or by pointer (reference). By default, Go uses pass-by-value (as seen in the first section of this post).\nUse \u0026amp; to get a variable\u0026rsquo;s memory address.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; ) func main() { var a int fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;%x\u0026#34;, \u0026amp;a) } Passing by reference sends the memory address to the function; modifications affect the original variable. Here\u0026rsquo;s the swap function again, using pointers:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 package main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func swap(a, b *int) { var tmp = *a *a = *b *b = tmp } func main() { x, y := 10, 20 swap(\u0026amp;x, \u0026amp;y) fmt.Println(\u0026#34;x =\u0026#34;, x, \u0026#34;y =\u0026#34;, y) } defer The defer statement schedules a function call to run just before the surrounding function returns. It is often used for:\nReleasing resources Catching and handling panics Logging It\u0026rsquo;s similar to finally in a try...catch...finally block.\nCommonly used for paired operations like opening/closing files, acquiring/releasing locks, or connecting/disconnecting. It ensures resources are cleaned up even if an error occurs or the function returns early.\nIf a function has multiple defer statements, they are executed in LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) order, like a stack.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 package main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func deferDemo() { defer fmt.Println(\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;) defer fmt.Println(\u0026#34;2\u0026#34;) defer fmt.Println(\u0026#34;3\u0026#34;) defer fmt.Println(\u0026#34;4\u0026#34;) } func main() { deferDemo() } /* * Output * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 */ recover A runtime panic will crash the program. recover is a built-in function used to \u0026ldquo;intercept\u0026rdquo; a panic, similar to a catch block in Java.\nrecover is only effective when called inside a deferred function.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 package main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func deferDemo(i int) { var arr [10]int // Set up interceptor before the error occurs defer func() { // Use recover to catch panic info err := recover() if err != nil { fmt.Println(err) } }() arr[i] = 10 } func main() { deferDemo(10) fmt.Println(\u0026#34;main code\u0026#34;) } /* * Output * runtime error: index out of range [10] with length 10 * main code */ ","date":"2024-02-22T04:47:28+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/156/","title":"GoLang Functions"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview GoLang Series\nHello GoLang: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/154 GoLang (var and const) Variables and Constants: This article\nGoLang (func) Functions: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/156 GoLang (slice and map) Slices: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/160 GoLang (OOP) Object-Oriented Programming: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/162 GoLang (reflect) Reflection: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/204 GoLang (struct tag) Struct Tags: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/205 GoLang (goroutine) Goroutines: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/206 GoLang (channel) Channels: https://blog.yexca.net/archives/207 Variables Variables are generally declared using the var keyword.\nSingle Variables Explicit Type Declarations without an initial value default to 0.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 package main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func main() { var a int fmt.Println(\u0026#34;a =\u0026#34;, a) } Specifying an initial value; a is 100.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 package main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func main() { var a int = 100 fmt.Println(\u0026#34;a =\u0026#34;, a) } Omitting Type If you don\u0026rsquo;t specify the type during declaration, Go will infer it automatically.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;reflect\u0026#34; ) func main() { var a = 100 fmt.Println(\u0026#34;a =\u0026#34;, a) fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;Type of a = %s\u0026#34;, reflect.TypeOf(a)) } Short Declaration (:=) Since type inference works, you can use := to declare and initialize variables directly.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;reflect\u0026#34; ) func main() { p := 3.14 fmt.Println(\u0026#34;p =\u0026#34;, p) fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;Type of p is %s\u0026#34;, reflect.TypeOf(p)) } /* * Output * p = 3.14 * Type of p is float64 */ Multiple Variables Same Type 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 package main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func main() { var a, b int fmt.Println(\u0026#34;a =\u0026#34;, a) fmt.Println(\u0026#34;b =\u0026#34;, b) } Same Type Assignment 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 package main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func main() { var a, b int = 100, 200 fmt.Println(\u0026#34;a =\u0026#34;, a) fmt.Println(\u0026#34;b =\u0026#34;, b) } Different Types 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;reflect\u0026#34; ) func main() { var a, b = 100, 3.14 fmt.Println(\u0026#34;a =\u0026#34;, a) fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;Type of a is %s\\n\u0026#34;, reflect.TypeOf(a)) fmt.Println(\u0026#34;b =\u0026#34;, b) fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;Type of b is %s\u0026#34;, reflect.TypeOf(b)) } /* * Output * a = 100 * Type of a is int * b = 3.14 * Type of b is float64 */ Different Types 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;reflect\u0026#34; ) func main() { a, b := 100, \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34; fmt.Println(\u0026#34;a =\u0026#34;, a) fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;Type of a is %s\\n\u0026#34;, reflect.TypeOf(a)) fmt.Println(\u0026#34;b =\u0026#34;, b) fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;Type of b is %s\u0026#34;, reflect.TypeOf(b)) } A string type in Go is a structure containing a pointer to the underlying array and its length.

This made it hard to reuse and maintain. To fix this and follow the Single Responsibility Principle, we need to separate them. Three-tier architecture makes code more reusable, easier to maintain, and more extensible.\nThe three layers are Controller, Service, and Dao.\nController: The control layer. It receives requests from the frontend, processes them, and responds with data. Service: The business logic layer. It handles specific business logic. Dao: The Data Access Object (or persistence layer). It handles data access operations like CRUD. Browser sends request -\u0026gt; Controller receives request, responds with data -\u0026gt; Service processes logic -\u0026gt; Dao accesses data.\nThe emp example code can be optimized as follows:\nController 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 @RestController public class EmpController { @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/listEmp\u0026#34;) public Result listEmp(){ EmpService empServiceA = new EmpServiceA(); List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; empList = empServiceA.listEmp(); return Result.success(empList); } } Service 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 // interface public interface EmpService { public List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; listEmp(); } public class EmpServiceA implements EmpService { private EmpDao empDao = new EmpDaoA(); public List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; listEmp(){ List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; empList = empDao.listEmp(); empList.forEach(emp -\u0026gt; { String gender = emp.getGender(); if(\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;.equals(gender)){ emp.setGender(\u0026#34;男\u0026#34;); } else if (\u0026#34;2\u0026#34;.equals(gender)) { emp.setGender(\u0026#34;女\u0026#34;); } String job = emp.getJob(); if(\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;.equals(job)){ emp.setJob(\u0026#34;讲师\u0026#34;); } else if (\u0026#34;2\u0026#34;.equals(job)) { emp.setJob(\u0026#34;班主任\u0026#34;); } else if (\u0026#34;3\u0026#34;.equals(job)) { emp.setJob(\u0026#34;就业指导\u0026#34;); } }); return empList; } } Dao 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 // interface public interface EmpDao { public List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; listEmp(); } public class EmpDaoA implements EmpDao { public List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; listEmp(){ String file = this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResource(\u0026#34;emp.xml\u0026#34;).getFile(); List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; empList = XmlParserUtils.parse(file, Emp.class); return empList; } } Layered Decoupling Cohesion: The degree of functional relatedness within the elements of a single software module.\nCoupling: Measures the degree of dependence or association between different layers/modules in software.\nSoftware design principle: High cohesion, low coupling.\nFor more details, see https://blog.yexca.net/archives/145 For instance, in the three-tier architecture example above, the Controller is coupled with the Service, and the Service is coupled with the Dao.\nIn the Controller, directly creating a Service object like EmpService empServiceA = new EmpServiceA(); means using A. If you switch to B, you\u0026rsquo;d need to change the Controller. To change the Service without modifying the Controller, you can create a container. This allows the Controller to get objects from the container (Dependency Injection), and the Service injects its services into the container (Inversion of Control).\nInversion of Control (IoC): The control over object creation shifts from the program itself to an external entity (the container). Dependency Injection (DI): The container provides the application with the resources it needs at runtime. Bean Object: An object created and managed by the IoC container. IoC To let the IoC container manage an object, you need to add one of the following annotations to its class:\nAnnotation Description Location @Component Basic annotation to declare a bean Use this when it doesn\u0026rsquo;t fall into the other three categories (e.g., utility classes) @Controller A derived annotation of @Component Annotate on controller classes @Service A derived annotation of @Component Annotate on business classes @Repository A derived annotation of @Component Annotate on data access classes (less common with MyBatis integration) When declaring a bean, you can specify its name using the value attribute. If not specified, the default is the class name with the first letter lowercase. In SpringBoot web development, you can only declare controller beans using @Controller. Bean Component Scanning For the four bean declaration annotations above to work, they also need to be scanned by the @ComponentScan annotation.\nThis annotation is actually included in the @SpringBootApplication annotation used on the startup class. The default scan scope is the package of the startup class and its sub-packages.\nYou can specify the scan scope via the value or basePackage attribute.\n1 @ComponentScan({\u0026#34;dao\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;net.yexca\u0026#34;}) Example In the example above:\nController Since @RestController already includes @Controller, no changes are needed.\nService 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 // interface public interface EmpService { public List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; listEmp(); } // Add to the implementation class @Service // Hands this class over to the IoC container for management, making it an IoC container Bean. public class EmpServiceA implements EmpService { private EmpDao empDao = new EmpDaoA(); public List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; listEmp(){ List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; empList = empDao.listEmp(); empList.forEach(emp -\u0026gt; { String gender = emp.getGender(); if(\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;.equals(gender)){ emp.setGender(\u0026#34;男\u0026#34;); } else if (\u0026#34;2\u0026#34;.equals(gender)) { emp.setGender(\u0026#34;女\u0026#34;); } String job = emp.getJob(); if(\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;.equals(job)){ emp.setJob(\u0026#34;讲师\u0026#34;); } else if (\u0026#34;2\u0026#34;.equals(job)) { emp.setJob(\u0026#34;班主任\u0026#34;); } else if (\u0026#34;3\u0026#34;.equals(job)) { emp.setJob(\u0026#34;就业指导\u0026#34;); } }); return empList; } } Dao 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 // interface public interface EmpDao { public List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; listEmp(); } // Add to the implementation class @Repository // Hands this class over to the IoC container for management, making it an IoC container Bean. public class EmpDaoA implements EmpDao { public List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; listEmp(){ String file = this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResource(\u0026#34;emp.xml\u0026#34;).getFile(); List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; empList = XmlParserUtils.parse(file, Emp.class); return empList; } } DI You can inject dependencies using the @Autowired annotation. However, by default, it injects by type. If multiple beans of the same type exist, it will throw an error.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s add DI to the previous example (modified code will be commented out).\nController 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 @RestController public class EmpController { @Autowired // At runtime, the IoC container will provide a Bean object of this type and assign it to this variable -- Dependency Injection. private EmpService empService; @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/listEmp\u0026#34;) public Result listEmp(){ //EmpService empServiceA = new EmpServiceA(); //List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; empList = empServiceA.listEmp(); List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; empList = empService.listEmp(); return Result.success(empList); } } Service 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 // interface public interface EmpService { public List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; listEmp(); } // Add to the implementation class @Service // Hands this class over to the IoC container for management, making it an IoC container Bean. public class EmpServiceA implements EmpService { @Autowired // At runtime, the IoC container will provide a Bean object of this type and assign it to this variable -- Dependency Injection. private EmpDao empDao; // private EmpDao empDao = new EmpDaoA(); public List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; listEmp(){ List\u0026lt;Emp\u0026gt; empList = empDao.listEmp(); empList.forEach(emp -\u0026gt; { String gender = emp.getGender(); if(\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;.equals(gender)){ emp.setGender(\u0026#34;男\u0026#34;); } else if (\u0026#34;2\u0026#34;.equals(gender)) { emp.setGender(\u0026#34;女\u0026#34;); } String job = emp.getJob(); if(\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;.equals(job)){ emp.setJob(\u0026#34;讲师\u0026#34;); } else if (\u0026#34;2\u0026#34;.equals(job)) { emp.setJob(\u0026#34;班主任\u0026#34;); } else if (\u0026#34;3\u0026#34;.equals(job)) { emp.setJob(\u0026#34;就业指导\u0026#34;); } }); return empList; } } Dao No data injection needed, so no changes.\n@Primary If you add another EmpServiceB implementation for Service and also use @Autowired, the program will throw an error.

After processing, the result is returned to the DispatcherServlet, and then sent back to the browser.\nThe DispatcherServlet is known as the core controller or front controller.\nBrowser request data is encapsulated into an HttpServletRequest object, and response data into an HttpServletResponse object.\n*Controllers receive requests and set responses.\nRequest Simple Parameters First, the traditional way: get request parameters manually via the HttpServletRequest object.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/simpleParam\u0026#34;) public String simpleParam(HttpServletRequest request){ String name = request.getParameter(\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;); String ageStr = request.getParameter(\u0026#34;age\u0026#34;); int age = Integer.parseInt(ageStr); System.out.println(name + \u0026#34;;\u0026#34; + age); return \u0026#34;OK\u0026#34;; } When you visit http://localhost:8080/simpleParam?name=tom\u0026age=18 in your browser, the page returns \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;, and the program outputs \u0026ldquo;Tom;18\u0026rdquo;.\nClearly, this method is too cumbersome. In Spring Boot, you can simply define method parameters with the same names as the request parameters to receive them.\n1 2 3 4 5 @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/simpleParam\u0026#34;) public String simpleParam(String name, Integer age){ System.out.println(name + \u0026#34;;\u0026#34; + age); return \u0026#34;OK\u0026#34;; } Same effect as above.\nHowever, the above method will still run even if the request parameter names differ; missing parameters will be null.\nYou can use @RequestParam to map request parameter names to different method parameter names.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/simpleParam\u0026#34;) public String simpleParam(@RequestParam(name = \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;) String username, Integer age){ // When @RequestParam is declared, it means the parameter *must* be passed, otherwise an error occurs. // If changed to @RequestParam(name = \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;, required = false), the parameter is optional.

But for more data, you can use a simple object (POJO). If request parameter names match the POJO\u0026rsquo;s property names, just define a POJO to receive them.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/simplePojo\u0026#34;) public String simplePojo(User user){ System.out.println(user); return \u0026#34;OK\u0026#34;; } // User class public class User{ private String name; private Integer age; // getters, setters, toString method } Visiting http://localhost:8080/simplePojo?name=tom\u0026age=18 returns \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;, and the program outputs \u0026ldquo;User{name=\u0026lsquo;tom\u0026rsquo;, age=18}\u0026rdquo;.\nComplex object parameters: If request parameter names match the method parameter\u0026rsquo;s object property names, nested POJO properties can be received by following the object hierarchy.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/complexPojo\u0026#34;) public String complexPojo(UserComplex user){ System.out.println(user); return \u0026#34;OK\u0026#34;; } // User class public class UserComplex{ private String name; private Integer age; private Address address; // getters, setters, toString } // Address class public class Address{ private String province; private String city; // getters, setters, toString } Visiting http://localhost:8080/complexPojo?name=tom\u0026age=18\u0026address.province=beijing\u0026address.city=beijing returns \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;, and the program outputs \u0026ldquo;UserComplex{name=\u0026lsquo;tom\u0026rsquo;, age=1000, address=Address{province=\u0026lsquo;ads,beijing\u0026rsquo;, city=\u0026lsquo;asda,beijing\u0026rsquo;}}\u0026rdquo;.\nArray Parameters If the request parameter name matches the method\u0026rsquo;s array parameter name, and there are multiple values, you can define an array-type method parameter to accept them. For example, for checkboxes.\n1 2 3 4 5 @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/arrayParam\u0026#34;) public String arrayParam(String[] hobby){ System.out.println(Arrays.toString(hobby)); return \u0026#34;OK\u0026#34;; } Visiting http://localhost:8080/arrayParam?hobby=ads\u0026hobby=58s returns \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;, and the program outputs \u0026ldquo;[ads, 58s]\u0026rdquo;.\nCollection Parameters If the request parameter name matches the method\u0026rsquo;s collection parameter name, and there are multiple values, use @RequestParam to bind the parameters.\n1 2 3 4 5 @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/listParam\u0026#34;) public String listParam(@RequestParam List\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; hobby){ System.out.println(hobby); return \u0026#34;OK\u0026#34;; } Visiting http://localhost:8080/listParam?hobby=ads\u0026hobby=58s returns \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;, and the program outputs \u0026ldquo;[ads, 58s]\u0026rdquo;.\nDate Parameters Use the @DateTimeFormat annotation to convert date parameter formats.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s worth noting there are three common parameter formats:\nyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss yyyy年MM月dd日 HH时mm分ss秒 (yyyy年MM月dd日 HH时mm分ss秒) Frontend and backend need to agree on the format.\n1 2 3 4 5 @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/dateParam\u0026#34;) public String dateParam(@DateTimeFormat(pattern = \u0026#34;yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\u0026#34;) LocalDateTime localDateTime){ System.out.println(localDateTime); return \u0026#34;OK\u0026#34;; } Visiting http://localhost:8080/dateParam?localDateTime=2024-01-01%2001:01:01 returns \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;, and the program outputs \u0026ldquo;2024-01-01T01:01:01\u0026rdquo;.\nJSON Parameters If JSON data keys match the method parameter\u0026rsquo;s object property names, you can define a POJO-type method parameter to receive them. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to use @RequestBody.\nTo send JSON data, you must use a POST request.\n1 2 3 4 5 @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/jsonParam\u0026#34;) public String jsonParam(@RequestBody UserComplex userComplex){ System.out.println(userComplex); return \u0026#34;OK\u0026#34;; } Request data:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;jane\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;18\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;address\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;province\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;上海\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;city\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;上海\u0026#34; } } Using POST to request http://localhost:8080/jsonParam with the data above, the page returns \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;, and the program outputs \u0026ldquo;UserComplex{name=\u0026lsquo;jane\u0026rsquo;, age=18, address=Address{province=\u0026lsquo;上海\u0026rsquo;, city=\u0026lsquo;上海\u0026rsquo;}}\u0026rdquo;.\nPath Parameters Pass parameters directly in the request URL. Use {...} to mark path parameters, and @PathVariable to retrieve them.\n1 2 3 4 5 @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/path/{id}\u0026#34;) public String pathParam(@PathVariable Integer id){ System.out.println(id); return \u0026#34;OK\u0026#34;; } Visiting http://localhost:8080/path/52 returns \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;, and the program outputs \u0026ldquo;52\u0026rdquo;.\nVisiting http://localhost:8080/path/255 returns \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;, and the program outputs \u0026ldquo;255\u0026rdquo;.\nFor multiple path parameters:\n1 2 3 4 5 @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/path/{id}/{name}\u0026#34;) public String pathParam(@PathVariable Integer id, @PathVariable String name){ System.out.println(id + \u0026#34;;\u0026#34; + name); return \u0026#34;OK\u0026#34;; } Visiting http://localhost:8080/path/255/Tom returns \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;, and the program outputs \u0026ldquo;255;Tom\u0026rdquo;.\nSummary Simple Parameters Define method parameters; request parameter names should match variable names. If they don\u0026rsquo;t match, map them manually with @RequestParam. Object Parameters Request parameter names should match object property names for automatic encapsulation. Array \u0026amp; Collection Parameters Arrays: Request parameter name matches array name for direct encapsulation. Collections: Request parameter name matches collection name; bind with @RequestParam. Date Parameters @DateTimeFormat JSON Parameters @RequestBody Path Parameters @PathVariable Response Use @ResponseBody to handle responses.\nThe above request methods could send responses because the @RestController annotation includes both @Controller and @ResponseBody.\n@ResponseBody Type: Method annotation, Class annotation\nLocation: On a Controller method or class\nPurpose: Returns the method\u0026rsquo;s return value directly as the response. If the return type is an object or collection, it will be converted to JSON format.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 @RestController public class ResponseController { @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/hello\u0026#34;) public String hello(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;Hello SpringBoot\u0026#34;); return \u0026#34;Hello SpringBoot\u0026#34;; } @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/getAddr\u0026#34;) public Address getAddr(){ Address address = new Address(); address.setProvince(\u0026#34;上海\u0026#34;); address.setCity(\u0026#34;上海\u0026#34;); return address; } @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/listAddr\u0026#34;) public List\u0026lt;Address\u0026gt; listAddr(){ List\u0026lt;Address\u0026gt; list = new ArrayList\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); Address address1 = new Address(); address1.setProvince(\u0026#34;北京\u0026#34;); address1.setCity(\u0026#34;北京\u0026#34;); Address address2 = new Address(); address2.setProvince(\u0026#34;上海\u0026#34;); address2.setCity(\u0026#34;上海\u0026#34;); list.add(address1); list.add(address2); return list; } } Visit the respective URLs to test.\nUnified Response Result The return types of the three methods above are all different, which makes frontend development harder. To address this, you can unify the response results into a single class.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 public class Result{ // Response code: 1 for success, 0 for failure. private Integer code; // Message private String msg; // Returned data private Object data; // ... } Making all response methods return a Result object makes project management and maintenance easier.\nFor example, this class:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 public class Result { private Integer code ;// 1 for success, 0 for failure private String msg; // Message private Object data; // Data payload public Result() { } public Result(Integer code, String msg, Object data) { this.code = code; this.msg = msg; this.data = data; } public Integer getCode() { return code; } public void setCode(Integer code) { this.code = code; } public String getMsg() { return msg; } public void setMsg(String msg) { this.msg = msg; } public Object getData() { return data; } public void setData(Object data) { this.data = data; } public static Result success(Object data){ return new Result(1, \u0026#34;success\u0026#34;, data); } public static Result success(){ return new Result(1, \u0026#34;success\u0026#34;, null); } public static Result error(String msg){ return new Result(0, msg, null); } @Override public String toString() { return \u0026#34;Result{\u0026#34; + \u0026#34;code=\u0026#34; + code + \u0026#34;, msg=\u0026#39;\u0026#34; + msg + \u0026#39;\\\u0026#39;\u0026#39; + \u0026#34;, data=\u0026#34; + data + \u0026#39;}\u0026#39;; } } Then the above code can be changed to:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/hello\u0026#34;) public Result hello(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;Hello SpringBoot\u0026#34;); return Result.success(\u0026#34;Hello SpringBoot\u0026#34;); } @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/getAddr\u0026#34;) public Result getAddr(){ Address address = new Address(); address.setProvince(\u0026#34;上海\u0026#34;); address.setCity(\u0026#34;上海\u0026#34;); return Result.success(address); } @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/listAddr\u0026#34;) public Result listAddr(){ List\u0026lt;Address\u0026gt; list = new ArrayList\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); Address address1 = new Address(); address1.setProvince(\u0026#34;北京\u0026#34;); address1.setCity(\u0026#34;北京\u0026#34;); Address address2 = new Address(); address2.setProvince(\u0026#34;上海\u0026#34;); address2.setCity(\u0026#34;上海\u0026#34;); list.add(address1); list.add(address2); return Result.success(list); } Visit the respective URLs to test.\n","date":"2024-01-14T16:47:28+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/144/","title":"Spring Request and Response"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Maven is a tool for managing and building Java projects.\nIt simplifies dependency management (jar files) to avoid version conflicts, provides a standard project structure, and offers a cross-platform automated build process.\nInstallation Download it from the official website and unzip it.

A single project can include multiple dependencies.\nConfiguration steps:\nAdd the \u0026lt;dependencies\u0026gt; tag in pom.xml. Use the \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; tag inside \u0026lt;dependencies\u0026gt; to import coordinates. Define the groupId, artifactId, and version.

Indirect Dependency: When a dependency depends on other resources, the current project implicitly depends on those resources. When you add a dependency that relies on other packages, those packages are added automatically.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t need a specific sub-dependency, you can exclude it (this breaks the dependency link; no version is required for excluded resources).\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 \u0026lt;!-- Example: Excluding junit from a project --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;com.yexca\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;maven-project\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;1.0-SNAPSHOT\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;exclusions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;exclusion\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;junit\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;junit\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/exclusion\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/exclusions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; Dependency Scope By default, jar files are available everywhere.

Each lifecycle consists of several phases. Phases are sequential; later phases depend on the completion of earlier ones.\nclean pre-clean clean: Removes files generated by previous builds (the target folder). post-clean default validate initialize generate-sources process-sources generate-resources process-resources compile: Compiles the source code. process-classes generate-test-sources process-test-sources generate-test-resources process-test-resources test-compile process-test-classes test: Runs tests using a unit testing framework (e.g., JUnit). prepare-package package: Packages compiled code (e.g., jar, war). verify install: Installs the project into the local repository. deploy site pre-site site post-site site-deploy Within the same lifecycle, running a later phase automatically triggers all preceding phases.\nMulti-module Design Multi-module design allows splitting a large project into several independent modules during the design phase. If one module needs functionality from another, it can simply depend on that module.\nCommon entities or utility classes can be placed in separate modules to be shared. This improves project management, maintenance, scalability, and resource sharing.\nInheritance Dependencies like Lombok might be used in every module. Instead of declaring it in every module, you can use inheritance.\nInheritance Relationship Create a parent project and move shared dependencies to its configuration. Child projects inheriting from the parent will automatically inherit these dependencies, eliminating redundant configuration.\nInheritance describes the relationship between two projects, similar to inheritance in Java. It simplifies dependency management and ensures consistency.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \u0026lt;!-- Specifying the parent project --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;parent\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;relativePath\u0026gt;....\u0026lt;/relativePath\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/parent\u0026gt; In JavaWeb development, the parent project can inherit from spring-boot-starter-parent, while other modules inherit from that parent project.\nUsually, child projects are located in subdirectories of the parent project.\nExample:\nParent project packaging type is pom: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 \u0026lt;parent\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.boot\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-boot-starter-parent\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;2.7.5\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;relativePath/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- lookup parent from repository --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/parent\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;net.yexca\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;tlias-parent\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;1.0-SNAPSHOT\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;packaging\u0026gt;pom\u0026lt;/packaging\u0026gt; Maven Packaging Types:\njar: Standard module packaging.

This gets tedious with many modules.\nMaven aggregation allows for one-click project builds (clean, compile, test, package, install, etc.).\nAggregation: Organizing multiple modules into a single unit for simultaneous building. Aggregation Project: An \u0026ldquo;empty\u0026rdquo; project containing only a pom.xml (usually the same as the parent project in inheritance). Purpose: Fast project building without manually following dependency order. Define sub-modules in the aggregation project using the \u0026lt;modules\u0026gt; tag.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \u0026lt;!-- Aggregating other modules --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;modules\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Project paths --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;module\u0026gt;../tlias-pojo\u0026lt;/module\u0026gt; \u0026lt;module\u0026gt;../tlias-utils\u0026lt;/module\u0026gt; \u0026lt;module\u0026gt;../tlias-web-management\u0026lt;/module\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/modules\u0026gt; Running compile, package, or install on the aggregation project will automatically sync those operations to all sub-modules.\nFeature Inheritance Aggregation Purpose Simplifies dependency config and management. Enables rapid project building. Similarities Packaging is pom; usually combined in the same file. Design-oriented modules with no actual source code. Differences Relationship defined in child modules. Parent doesn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;know\u0026rdquo; children. Relationship defined in the aggregator. Aggregator \u0026ldquo;knows\u0026rdquo; children. Private Repositories A private repository (Nexus, Artifactory) is a remote repository hosted on a local network. It acts as a proxy for the central repository and facilitates resource sharing and synchronization within a team.\nWhen a project needs a dependency, Maven checks the local repo. If missing, it checks the private repo. If the private repo doesn\u0026rsquo;t have it, it downloads it from the central repository, caches it, and serves it to the local repo.\nCompanies usually provide a private repository, so you won\u0026rsquo;t need to configure your own.\nPrivate Repo Types and Project Versions Private Repo Categories:\nRELEASE: For finished RELEASE versions of internal code. SNAPSHOT: For internal development SNAPSHOT versions. Central: Proxied dependencies downloaded from the Maven Central Repository. Project Versioning:\nRELEASE: Stable, finished versions for deployment, stored in the RELEASE repo. SNAPSHOT: Unstable, work-in-progress versions, stored in the SNAPSHOT repo.

For a circuit routing problem of size $n$, we can construct the following recurrence:\n$$ \\begin{align*} \u0026(1) \\ \\text{When } i=1, \\\\ \u0026size(1,j)= \\begin{cases} 0, \u0026 \\text{j \u003c } \\pi(1) \\\\ 1, \u0026 \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\\\ \u0026(2) \\ \\text{When } i\u003e1, \\\\ \u0026size(i,j)= \\begin{cases} size(i-1,j), \u0026 \\text{j \u003c } \\pi(i) \\\\ \\max\\{size(i-1,j), size(i-1,\\pi(i)-1)+1\\}, \u0026 \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\end{align*} $$C Code 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 #include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;stdlib.h\u0026gt; #define N 10 // Problem size // Calculate the maximum number of non-crossing connections void maxNum(int pi[], int **size); // Construct the maximum non-crossing subset; net[i] stores the top terminal index int constructSet(int pi[], int **size, int *net); int main(void){ // Index starts from 1 int pi[N+1] = {0, 8, 7, 4, 2, 5, 1, 9, 3, 10, 6}; int net[N]; int **size; size = (int**)malloc(sizeof(int*)*(N+1)); for(int i=0; i\u0026lt;N+1; i++) size[i]=(int*)malloc(sizeof(int)*(N+1)); maxNum(pi, size); int m = constructSet(pi, size, net); printf(\u0026#34;Maximum non-crossing connections: %d\\n\u0026#34;, m); printf(\u0026#34;Nets included:\\n\u0026#34;); for(int i=0; i\u0026lt;m; i++){ printf(\u0026#34;(%d,%d)\\n\u0026#34;, net[i], pi[net[i]]); } return 0; } void maxNum(int pi[], int **size){ // size[i][j]: max non-crossing connections for board with i top and j bottom terminals int i, j; // case when i=1 for(j=0; j\u0026lt;pi[1]; j++) size[1][j] = 0; for(j=pi[1]; j\u0026lt;=N; j++) size[1][j] = 1; for(i=2; i\u0026lt;N; i++){ // when j \u0026lt; pi(i) for(j=0; j\u0026lt;pi[i]; j++) size[i][j] = size[i-1][j]; // when j \u0026gt;= pi(i) for(j=pi[i]; j\u0026lt;=N; j++) size[i][j] = size[i-1][j] \u0026gt;= size[i-1][pi[i]-1]+1 ? size[i-1][j] : size[i-1][pi[i]-1]+1; } // Maximum connections at size[N][N] size[N][N] = size[N-1][N] \u0026gt;= size[N-1][pi[N]-1]+1 ? size[N-1][N] : size[N-1][pi[N]-1]+1; } // Construct the MNS set, net[i] stores the top terminal index int constructSet(int pi[], int **size, int *net){ int i; int j = N; int m = 0; // Counter for connections in the MNS for(i=N; i\u0026gt;1; i--){ // If the size changed, (i, pi[i]) is part of the subset if(size[i][j] != size[i-1][j]){ net[m++] = i; // Record i, increment count j = pi[i] - 1; // Update the bottom terminal range limit } } // handle when i=1 if(j \u0026gt;= pi[1]) net[m++] = 1; return m; } Others While searching, I came across an existing article: Algorithm Design and Analysis — Circuit Routing (Dynamic Programming) References LaTeX Formula Handbook Using LaTeX in Typora: Left-aligning multi-line formulas Three methods to dynamically allocate a 2D array using malloc ","date":"2023-05-16T17:53:31+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/106/","title":"Algorithm: Circuit Routing Problem (Dynamic Programming)"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash Chapter 12: Managing Disks and Filesystems 12.1 Understanding Disk Storage The fundamental principles of data storage are similar across most modern operating systems. Disks serve as permanent storage, while RAM (Random Access Memory) and swap space are used for temporary storage. For instance, when you run a command, it\u0026rsquo;s copied from the hard drive to RAM so the CPU (Central Processing Unit) can access it faster.\nThe CPU can access data from RAM much quicker than from the hard drive. However, because RAM is costly and data is lost when power is removed, disk capacity is far greater than RAM.\nWhen RAM is full due to running too many processes or a process with a memory leak, if the system doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide a way to extend memory, new processes will fail. This is where swap space comes in. Algorithms are used to move some data from RAM to disk, and then swap it back when needed.\nWhen you need to exchange files between different operating systems, the VFAT filesystem is commonly used.\n12.2 Partitioning Hard Drives Changing partitions can prevent your system from booting. It\u0026rsquo;s recommended to practice with an empty drive until you\u0026rsquo;re proficient before applying it to a live system.\n12.2.1 Understanding Partition Tables Traditionally, PC architecture computers used MBR (Master Boot Record) partition tables to store information about hard drive partition sizes and layout. However, in recent years, a new standard called GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) Partition Table has been adopted on some UEFI-based computers, replacing the older BIOS system boot method.\nThe inherent limitations of the MBR specification led to the need for GUID partitions. MBR partitions are limited to 2TB, while GUID partitions can create partitions up to 9.4ZB.\nThe fdisk command doesn\u0026rsquo;t support GPT partitions; you can use the parted command instead.\n12.2.2 Viewing Disk Partitions fdisk -l /dev/sda or parted -l /dev/sdb\nSCSI or USB storage devices, represented by sd? devices (e.g., sda, sdb), can have up to 16 minor devices (e.g., the primary /dev/sdc device and /dev/sdc1 to /dev/sdc15), totaling 15 partitions.\nNVMe SSD storage devices, represented by nvme devices (e.g., nvme0, nvme1), can be divided into one or more namespaces (most devices only use the first) and partitions. For example, /dev/nvme0n1p1 refers to the first partition in the first namespace on the first NVMe device.\nFor x86 computers, a disk can have a maximum of 4 primary partitions. If you want more than 4 partitions, at least one must be an extended partition. Any partitions beyond the four primary ones are logical partitions, using space from the extended partition.\n12.2.3 Creating a Single-Partition Drive The general process for adding a storage medium:\nInstall the new hard drive or insert the new USB flash drive. Partition the new hard drive. Create a filesystem on the new hard drive. Mount the filesystem. If you\u0026rsquo;re using the parted command for modifications, proceed with caution at each step, as parted changes take effect immediately. The fdisk command, however, is reversible; changes are only applied when you explicitly confirm.\nData is invaluable, handle with care.\nDetermine the name of the newly added device.\nThere are many ways, for example, by checking system logs: journalctl -f\nFor example, let\u0026rsquo;s assume the assigned name is /dev/sdb.\nIf the device is auto-mounted, you need to unmount it first.\nCheck if /dev/sdb is mounted: mount | grep sdb\nUnmount the partition: umount /dev/sdb1\nUse the parted command to create a partition.\nparted /dev/sdb\nAfter executing, you will be in parted command mode. You can use parted single-letter commands to manage partitions.\nDelete a partition.\nThe single command p lists all partitions.\nUse the rm command, then press Enter and input the corresponding Number to delete a partition.\nCreate a GPT partition table.\nUse the command mklabel gpt\nCreate a new partition.\nEnter the mkpart command. The system will prompt you for the partition name, filesystem type, and then the start and end of the partition.\nFor example, name it yexca-UDisk, use xfs as the filesystem type, and partition from 1MB to 123GB:\n1 2 3 4 5 (parted) mkpart Partition name? []? yexca-UDisk File system type? [ext2]? xfs Start? 1 End? 123GB Check if the partition was created correctly.\nThe single command p lists all partitions.\nAfter the partition is created, you need to create a filesystem on it.\nFor example, to create an xfs filesystem: mkfs -t xfs /dev/sdb1\nIf the -t option is omitted, an ext2 filesystem is created by default.\nMount the filesystem.\n1 2 3 4 # Create the mount directory mkdir /mnt/tmp # Mount /dev/sdb1 to /mnt/tmp mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/tmp Unmount the filesystem.\nUse the command umount /dev/sdb1\nBy default, USB devices are generally auto-mounted when inserted.\nIf you need to manually mount, add a line to /etc/fstab:\n1 /dev/sdb1 /mnt/tmp xfs defaults 0 1 This line has six fields:\nPartition Mount directory Filesystem type Mount options at boot (e.g., defaults for default options) Whether to use the dump command to back up partition files (0 for no backup) Filesystem check order (0 for no check, 1 for root, 2 for others) 12.2.4 Creating a Multi-Partition Disk Using the fdisk command as an example:\nEnter fdisk command mode.\nfdisk /dev/sdb\nCreate partitions.\nSingle command n, then choose p for a primary partition or e for an extended partition. Select the partition number (default is usually fine).\nThen specify the allocated space. The starting sector can be default; after pressing Enter, input the ending space. For example, to allocate 5 GB, enter +5G. If you enter a bare number, it will be interpreted as sectors.\nFor the fourth partition, which would be an extended partition, you can accept the default for both start and end sectors.\nCheck partitions.\nSingle command p.\nThe default partition type is Linux. If you want to change the partition type:\nUse command t, select the partition number, then enter L to view the list of partition types. Find the hexadecimal code, then enter it to change.\nReview changes and save them.\nSingle command p to review, single command w to save changes.\nAfter making changes, check if the kernel is aware of the partition table modifications.\n1 2 3 4 5 grep sdb /proc/partitions # If the expected output is not shown, execute the following command partprobe /dev/sdb # Check again grep sdb /proc/partitions Create filesystems.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # Create an ext4 filesystem mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb1 # Create swap space mkswap /dev/sdb2 # Create an ext2 filesystem (default) mkfs /dev/sdb3 # Create a VFAT filesystem mkfs -t vfat /dev/sdb4 # Make this partition an LVM physical volume pvcreate /dev/sdb5 12.3 Managing Partitions with Logical Volume Management If disk space runs out, you might have to copy data to a larger disk, a process that requires downtime and is inefficient.\nLVM (Logical Volume Management) provides a flexible and efficient way to handle changing storage requirements. With LVM, you can add physical disk partitions to a pool of space called a volume group. Logical volumes then allocate space from the volume group as needed.\n12.3.1 Checking Existing LVM Use the command fdisk -l /dev/sda to check for existing Linux LVM partitions. Let\u0026rsquo;s assume /dev/sda2 is an LVM partition.\nCheck if this LVM partition is used in an LVM group:\npvdisplay /dev/sda2\nAssuming the volume group (VG Name) is vg_abc, view the volume group information:\nvgdisplay vg_abc\nFrom this, you can see the PE (Physical Extent) Size, which is the minimum storage unit used by the physical volume.\nView the allocation locations of the volume group\u0026rsquo;s PEs:\nlvdisplay vg_abc\nThe output will show multiple logical volume names. These logical volumes can be mounted directly by name, just like physical volumes.\n12.3.2 Creating LVM Logical Volumes Using LVM logical volumes is a top-down process, while creating them is a bottom-up process. First, create one or more physical volumes (pv), then use the physical volumes to create a volume group (vg), and finally create logical volumes (lv) from the volume group.\nPrepare a storage device with an LVM partition.\nThe creation process was mentioned in 12.2.4.\nAdd this physical volume to a volume group.\nvgcreate myvg0 /dev/sdb5\nView the volume group.\nvgdisplay myvg0\nIf the partition is 400M, you can use 396M of space (in 4M units).\n1 2 3 4 5 6 # Create a logical volume from a portion of the volume group space, e.g., create a 1G logical volume lvcreate -n name -L 1G myvg0 # Check if the logical volume exists ls /dev/mapper/myvg0* # If the following output is shown, creation was successful /dev/mapper/myvg0-name Create a filesystem and mount it.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 # Create an ext4 filesystem mkfs -t ext4 /dev/mapper/myvg0-name # Create a mount directory mkdir /mnt/tmp # Mount mount /dev/mapper/myvg0-name /mnt/tmp # Check if mounting was successful df -h /mnt/tmp Alternatively, you can add an entry to /etc/fstab for automatic mounting.\n12.3.3 Extending LVM Logical Volumes If you run out of space on a logical volume, you can add space without unmounting it. To do this, the volume group must have available space, and then you can extend the logical volume.\nCheck remaining space.\n1 2 3 4 # Check available space in the volume group vgdisplay myvg0 # Check available space in the logical volume df -h /mnt/tmp Extend the logical volume.\nlvextend -L +1G /dev/mapper/myvg0-name\nResize the filesystem.\nresize2fs -p /dev/mapper/myvg0-name\nCheck if resizing was successful.\ndf -h /mnt/tmp\n12.4 Mounting Filesystems In fact, the mount command and automatic mount configuration (the /etc/fstab file) have already been covered in the previous two sections.\n12.4.1 Supported Filesystems Enter the command cat /proc/filesystems to view supported filesystem types. The following is just a partial list:\nFilesystem Description ext4 Successor to the popular ext3 filesystem. Supports volumes up to 1EB and files up to 16 TB. iso9660 Evolved from the High Sierra filesystem (the original standard for CD-ROMs). Data CD-ROMs typically use this filesystem. Minix Originally used for the Minix version of UNIX. Supports filenames with a maximum of 30 characters. msdos MS-DOS filesystem type, can be used to mount floppies from Windows operating systems. vfat Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s extended FAT filesystem type. exfat An extended FAT filesystem optimized for SD cards, USB drives, and other flash memory. proc Not a true filesystem. It\u0026rsquo;s a Linux kernel filesystem interface. The /proc mount point should be a proc filesystem. Many utilities rely on /proc to access Linux kernel information. ReiserFS A journaling filesystem. Once the default filesystem for several Linux distributions, but now ext and xfs are more common. swap Used for swap partitions. squashfs A compressed and read-only filesystem type. NFS Network Filesystem, used to mount filesystems on other Linux or UNIX computers. ntfs Windows NT filesystem. xfs A high-performance filesystem originally developed by Silicon Graphics, excellent for handling large files. gfs2 A shared-disk filesystem that allows multiple computers to use a shared disk to communicate without going through a network filesystem layer, such as CIFS, NFS, etc. Enter man fs to learn more about Linux filesystem-related information.\n12.4.2 Enabling Swap Space 1 2 3 4 5 6 # View the number of swap partitions free -m # Create a swap partition mkswap /var/opt/myswap # Enable the swap partition swapon /var/opt/myswap If you\u0026rsquo;ve added a swap partition entry to /etc/fstab, such as:\n/var/opt/myswap swap swap defaults 0 0\nYou can enable it using swapon -a.\n12.4.3 Disabling Swap Space swapoff /var/opt/myswap\n12.4.4 Defining Mountable Filesystems with fstab As introduced in 12.2.3, the second field can use UUID instead of the device name, because device names can change.\nView UUIDs: blkid\n12.4.5 Mounting Filesystems with the mount Command Also introduced in 12.2.3.\n12.4.6 Mounting Disk Images in Loopback Mode This involves mounting an ISO image file.\n1 2 3 4 # Create a mount directory mkdir /mnt/tmp # Mount mount -o loop name.iso /mnt/tmp 12.4.7 Using the umount Command You can specify either the device partition name or the directory name.\nDevice partition name: umount /dev/sdb1\nDirectory name: umount /mnt/tmp\nTypically, it\u0026rsquo;s better to use the directory name.\nIf a directory is busy and cannot be unmounted, you can:\nLazy unmount: umount -l Force unmount: umount -f 12.5 Managing Storage with Cockpit GUI.

If an input is H (High), connect from its original line (first column). Then, connect these to an AND gate. Repeat this for all underlined entries from step 2.\nConnect all AND gate outputs to an OR gate.\nCircuit Simplification Digital circuit design flow: Problem definition -\u0026gt; Truth table -\u0026gt; Simplification -\u0026gt; Circuit diagram.\nSimplify using Karnaugh Maps (K-maps).\nConvert the truth table into a K-map. When building the truth table, columns usually start with the most significant bit, e.g., [C, B, A], with the result Z. A K-map is a 2D truth table, typically using 0s and 1s for logic levels. For three inputs, you might use B, A for rows/columns and C for the other axis, then fill the 2D table with the results.\nK-map Basics for Simplification K-maps wrap around horizontally and vertically because adjacent cells (including wrap-around) differ by only one bit.\nSimplification Process\nGroup adjacent 1s together. Find commonalities among the variables within each group (rows and columns). If a common variable\u0026rsquo;s value is 0, use its complement (e.g., A becomes !A). Example\nC\\BA 00 01 11 10 0 1 1 1 In the table above, the commonalities are C=0 and A=1, so the expression is !C * A.\nSimplification Rules\nGroups must be rectangular (or square) with sides of length 1, 2, or 4. Groups can overlap. Aim for the fewest, largest possible groups. Note: Groups can span across the edges (left-right, top-bottom wrap-around). If no further groups can be formed, the circuit is as simplified as possible.\nAfter simplification, draw the circuit diagram. Just follow the circuit drawing steps (starting from step 3 in the previous section) for all derived expressions.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Cares in Circuits When defining inputs, due to the nature of binary numbers, there might be \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t care\u0026rdquo; inputs that don\u0026rsquo;t need consideration.\nFor instance, if inputs represent months (1-12) using four binary bits, there are 16 possible inputs. Numbers like 0, 13, 14, and 15 are \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t cares\u0026rdquo; because they\u0026rsquo;re invalid month values.\nThese \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t care\u0026rdquo; inputs can be represented by \u0026lsquo;-\u0026rsquo; in a K-map and can be included in groups to further simplify the expression.\nBuilding Sequential Circuits Sequential circuits require both combinational logic and flip-flops.\nRegarding the \u0026ldquo;memory\u0026rdquo; in sequential circuits: Think of a vending machine. It remembers the total amount inserted. Without memory, it would only recognize the last coin\u0026rsquo;s value.\nA flip-flop, like a clock (CLK), is introduced. Inputs only affect outputs when the CLK is triggered; otherwise, the output remains unchanged.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take drawing an electronic die as an example.\nDraw the state transition diagram. How does the electronic die change over time? If \u0026ldquo;stop\u0026rdquo; is low, it cycles from 1 to 6, then back to 1. If \u0026ldquo;stop\u0026rdquo; is high, it stays at a specific point.\nRepresent states using binary numbers. Represent each situation or state using binary, then create a state transition table. Design the circuit from the state transition table, using D flip-flops to store states.\nDesign the combinational circuit. Determining the next state from the current state is, essentially, a combinational circuit.\n","date":"2022-12-04T16:54:29+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/80/","title":"My Thoughts on \"Manga Guide to Digital Electronics\""},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Chapter 6: Managing Running Processes Linux is a multi-user, multi-tasking operating system. Multi-tasking means multiple programs can run simultaneously. An instance of a running program is called a process.\nYou can start, pause, stop, or kill processes via the shell. You can also move processes to the background or bring them to the foreground.\n6.1 Understanding Processes A process is a running instance of a command. Every process in the system is identified by a Process ID (PID), which is unique to the current system. Besides the PID, a process is associated with a specific user account and group, which determines the system resources the process can access.\nCommands used to display process information primarily pull raw data from the /proc file system. Each process stores its information in a subdirectory within /proc named after its PID.\n6.2 Listing Processes Use the ps command or the top command. The top command provides a more screen-oriented way to list processes.\n6.2.1 Using the ps Command Using ps u displays the username and other detailed information.\nVSZ: Virtual Set Size. Shows the size of the process image in KB.\nRSS: Resident Set Size. Shows the size of the program in physical memory.\nVSZ is the amount of memory allocated to the process, while RSS is the amount of memory the process is actually using (representing physical memory that cannot be swapped).\nSTAT column: S indicates a sleeping process, R indicates a running process, and + indicates the process is associated with a foreground operation.\nView all processes for the current user: ps ux | less\nView processes for all users: ps aux | less\nYou can also customize the output columns and sort them. For example:\n1 ps -eo pid,user,uid,group,gid,vsz,rss,comm --sort=-vsz | less -e displays every running process, -o specifies the columns to display (where comm is the command name), and --sort=-vsz sorts by the VSZ column in descending order.\n6.2.2 Using the top Command The top command defaults to displaying processes sorted by current CPU usage percentage.\nOperations within the top command:\nCommand Description h Help M Sort by memory usage 1 Toggle display of all CPU usage (for multi-CPU systems) R Reverse sort order u Enter a username to show only that user\u0026rsquo;s processes r Change process priority (nice value) k Kill a process (kill command) 6.2.3 Using System Monitor A GUI tool for the GNOME desktop.\n6.3 Managing Background and Foreground Processes On systems without a GUI, you must use the shell for all operations. Although the Bash shell doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a GUI to manage programs, you can move active programs between the foreground and background. This allows you to run many programs and switch to the one you need to handle.\n6.3.1 Starting Background Processes To put a command in the background:\nAppend an \u0026amp; to the end of the command.\nUse the at command to run commands later.\nFor a running process, press Ctrl+Z to stop it, then type fg to bring it to the foreground or bg to start it running in the background.\nTo prevent background output from cluttering your foreground work, redirect it to the null device: 2\u0026gt;/dev/null.\nUse the jobs command to view background jobs (use -l to see PIDs). A + next to a job number indicates the most recent background job, while - indicates the job placed in the background just before the most recent one.\n6.3.2 Using Foreground and Background Commands To reference a background job, use % followed by the job number (from the jobs output). Other ways to reference jobs:\n% — References the most recent background job (the one with the +).\n%string — Job starting with \u0026ldquo;string\u0026rdquo; (must be unique).\n%?string — Job containing \u0026ldquo;string\u0026rdquo; anywhere in the command line (must be unique).\n%-- — References the job placed in the background before the most recent one (the one with the -).\nUse fg %1 to bring job #1 to the foreground. Use bg %5 to resume a stopped job #5 in the background.\nNote: The vi command stops automatically when moved to the background. Remember to save your file before backgrounding it to avoid data loss.\n6.4 Killing and Modifying Processes You can send different signals to a process to change its behavior or modify its processor priority.\n6.4.1 Using kill and killall While these commands are often used to terminate a process, they actually send signals. Signals are represented by numbers or names.\nSignal Number Description SIGHUP 1 Reread configuration files SIGINT 2 Interrupt via keyboard (Ctrl+C) SIGQUIT 3 Quit via keyboard SIGABRT 6 Abort signal generated by abort(3) SIGKILL 9 Kill signal (cannot be ignored) SIGTERM 15 Termination signal (default) SIGCONT 19, 18, 25 Continue a stopped process SIGSTOP 17, 19, 23 Stop a process For the last two signals, the first value applies to Alpha and SPARC, the middle to x86, and the last to MIPS architectures.\nThe default is the SIGTERM (15) signal. While processes can handle or ignore various signals, no process can block SIGKILL (9) or SIGSTOP.\nUsing kill to send a signal via PID: 1 kill [signal] [PID] Example: Killing process 2333: kill -9 2333 or kill -SIGKILL 2333.\nUsing killall to send a signal by name: Useful for killing multiple processes with the same name, but be careful not to kill essential processes accidentally.\nExample: Restarting gnome-shell: killall -1 gnome-shell\n6.4.2 Setting Processor Priority with nice and renice When the Linux kernel decides which process gets CPU time, it considers the \u0026ldquo;nice\u0026rdquo; value, ranging from -20 to 19. The default is 0.\nA lower nice value means higher priority. Only the root user can set negative values (increase priority). Normal users can only increase the nice value (decrease priority).\nUse the nice command to start a process with a specific priority, or renice to change the priority of an already running process by PID.\nnice -n +5 updatedb \u0026amp; runs the updatedb command in the background with a priority offset of +5.\nrenice -n 3 2333 changes the nice value of PID 2333 to 3.\n6.5 Limiting Processes with cgroups A nice value set for a process does not necessarily apply to its child processes. In other words, nice cannot limit the total amount of system resources a specific user or application can use.\nYou can use cgroups (control groups) to define a process as a \u0026ldquo;task\u0026rdquo; within a specific control group. You can set up tasks in a hierarchy, including \u0026ldquo;daemon\u0026rdquo; tasks (setting default limits for background servers) and sub-tasks with specific limits for things like httpd or vsftpd.\nWhen a task starts a process, the child process inherits the parent\u0026rsquo;s limits. These limits can cover storage, processor scheduling, process reporting, CPU allocation, device access, and memory usage.\nConfiguring cgroups can be complex, involving editing /etc/cgconfig.conf to create groups or /etc/cgrules.conf to limit specific users/groups. You can use the cgcreate command to add groups to the /sys/fs/cgroup hierarchy. Warning: incorrect settings may prevent the system from booting.\n","date":"2022-12-03T15:07:03+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/79/","title":"Linux Learning Chapter 6: Managing Running Processes"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash-lite Deploying on Windows 11.

BT download is recommended (use a proper torrent client, like qBittorrent ).\nThen drop it into your VM.\nVerify Boot Mode List the efivars directory:\n1 ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars If the directory shows up correctly with no errors, your system is booting in UEFI mode. If it\u0026rsquo;s missing, you\u0026rsquo;re likely in BIOS mode (or CSM mode).\nThis VM uses BIOS mode.\nConnect to the Internet Network interface and DHCP service are enabled by default, no config needed.\nUpdate System Time Enable sync with Network Time Protocol (NTP) server:\n1 timedatectl set-ntp true You can check service status with timedatectl status.\nCreate Disk Partitions Used the classic fdisk command for partitioning (MBR). Since it\u0026rsquo;s BIOS boot, I followed the official partitioning example, making only two partitions (swap and one for everything else).\nUse fdisk -l to list all disks (you can ignore devices ending in rom, loop, or airoot).\nStart partitioning with fdisk /dev/device_name.\nCommand Description n Create new partition p Check partitions t Change partition type w Save changes Specify partition size using ++num+K/M/G/T/P. If no suffix (K/M/G/T/P), it allocates sectors.\nFormat Partitions Create swap partition 1 mkswap /dev/swap_partition Create filesystem Commands vary based on filesystem. For example, ext4:\n1 mkfs -t ext4 /dev/partition Mount Partitions Mount the root partition to /mnt. If you have multiple partitions, make sure to mount the root partition first.\n1 mount /dev/partition /mnt Enable swap:\n1 swapon /dev/swap_partition Installation Select Mirrors The /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist file defines where packages are downloaded from. It updates automatically once connected to the internet, or you can change it manually. I\u0026rsquo;m leaving it as is.\nInstall Packages Use the pacstrap script to install the base package, Linux kernel, and vim. If you need other packages, just add their names to the command below. You can always install more later with pacman.\n1 pacstrap /mnt base linux vim System Config Fstab The /etc/fstab file describes how partitions are automatically mounted at system startup. You can generate it automatically with the following command (use -U or -L for UUIDs or labels; using UUIDs helps prevent boot issues).\n1 genfstab -U /mnt \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /mnt/etc/fstab Check if auto-config is correct:\n1 cat /mnt/etc/fstab Chroot Chroot into the newly installed system:\n1 arch-chroot /mnt Time Zone Taking Shanghai time as an example:\n1 ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Shanghai /etc/localtime Generate /etc/adjtime:\n1 hwclock --systohc Now you can use the date command to check if the time is correct.\nLocalization Edit /etc/locale.gen and uncomment en_GB.UTF-8.\nThen generate locale info:\n1 locale-gen Create /etc/locale.conf and edit the LANG variable, e.g., LANG=en_GB.UTF-8.\nNetwork Configuration Create /etc/hostname and enter your hostname.\nSince the VM uses DHCP, I\u0026rsquo;m skipping network configuration .\nRoot Password 1 passwd Install Bootloader Typically, you\u0026rsquo;d install GRUB.

These include terminals (tty*), hard drives (hd* or sd*), RAM (ram*), and CD-ROMs (cd*). Users can access devices directly via these files, though apps usually hide them. /etc Contains administrative configuration files. Most are plain text and can be edited with any text editor if you have the right permissions. /home Contains directories for every user with a login account (except root, which uses /root). /media A standard location for auto-mounting devices (especially removable media). Usually uses the volume name as the mount point. /lib Contains shared libraries needed by apps in /bin and /sbin to boot the system. /mnt Before /media became standard, /mnt was the common mount point for many devices. Some bootable Linux systems still use it for partitions and remote file systems. Many use it for temporary mounts. /misc Sometimes used for auto-mounting file systems on request. /opt Directory structure for storing add-on application software. /proc Contains information about system resources. /root The home directory for the root user. Kept separate from /home for security reasons. /sbin Contains administrative commands and daemons. /sys Contains parameters for tuning block storage and managing cgroups. /tmp Contains temporary files used by applications. /usr Contains user docs, games, graphics files (X11), libraries (lib), and other commands/files not needed during boot. Files in /usr are generally static after installation and can technically be mounted as read-only. /var Contains data directories used by various apps. Includes files for FTP (/var/ftp) or Web (/var/www) servers, system logs (/var/log), and spool files (/var/spool, like mail/cups). Files here change frequently. On servers, /var is often a separate partition. 4.1 Basic File System Commands cd, pwd, mkdir, rmdir, ls, touch\n4.2 Using Metacharacters and Operators Certain special characters are known as metacharacters or operators.\n4.2.1 File Matching Metacharacters (Wildcards) Metacharacter Description * Matches any number of characters ? Matches any single character [\u0026hellip;] Matches any character within the brackets; can include ranges of letters or numbers separated by a hyphen. Example: ls [a-g]* lists files or directories starting with letters a through g.\n4.2.2 File Redirection Metacharacters Metacharacter Description \u0026lt; Directs file content into a command. This is default behavior and often omitted. Example: less bigfile is same as less \u0026lt; bigfile. \u0026gt; Directs standard output (stdout) to a file. Overwrites the file if it exists. 2\u0026gt; Directs standard error (stderr) to a file. \u0026amp;\u0026gt; Directs both stdout and stderr to a file. \u0026raquo; Appends command output to the end of an existing file. Example command:\n1 man chmod | col -b \u0026gt; /tmp/chmod Formats the man page (man), strips backspaces (col -b), and saves output to /tmp/chmod (overwriting it if it exists).\n1 echo \u0026#34;Hello World!\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/hello Appends Hello World! to the file ~/hello.\nAnother type of redirection is called here text (or here document):\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ed /etc/resolv.conf \u0026lt;\u0026lt; resendit a nameserver 100.100.100.100 . w q resendit This uses the ed editor to automate adding a DNS server IP to /etc/resolv.conf (usually in a script run by root) using the content between the resendit tags.\n4.2.3 Brace Expansion Using {} allows you to expand a set of characters across filenames, directories, or arguments:\n1 touch memo{1,2,3,4,5} Creates 5 files: memo1 through memo5.\n1 touch {John,Bill,Sally}-{Breakfast,Lunch,Dinner} Creates 9 files.\n1 touch {a..f}{1..5} Creates 30 files from a1 to f5.\n4.3 Listing Files and Directories Usually, ls is aliased to ls --color=auto. Check aliases with:\n1 alias ls Use ls -la to see detailed info (-l) and hidden files (-a).\nColumn File Directory 1 Permissions Permissions 2 Number of links Number of links 3 Owner Owner 4 Group Group 5 Size in bytes Size of the directory file itself (not contents) 6 Last modification date/time Last modification date/time 7 Filename Directory name Notes:\nTime/date format depends on the LANG variable. An executable might have s permissions (-rwsr-sr-x), meaning any user can run it, but the process runs with the ownership of the app owner/group (SetUID/SetGID). If permissions end in t (drwxrwxr-t), it\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;sticky bit\u0026rdquo;. Users can add files, but cannot delete other users\u0026rsquo; files. SetGID on a directory makes new files inherit the directory\u0026rsquo;s group. If you see capital S or T instead of execution bits, it means SetGID or the sticky bit is set, but the execution bit is off. A plus sign at the end (-rw-rw-r-+) indicates extended attributes like ACLs or SELinux. A dot indicates SELinux attributes. cd ~yexca goes to yexca\u0026rsquo;s home. cd - returns to the previous working directory (stored in $OLDPWD). cd . refers to the current directory ($PWD).\nls flags: -t sorts by modification time; -F adds / to directories, * to executables, and @ to symlinks; --hide=yexca hides specific files/dirs; -S sorts by size; -d shows info about the directory itself instead of its contents.\n4.4 Understanding File Permissions and Ownership The first column of ls -l:\nThe first character is the file type:\nLetter Type - File d Directory l Symbolic link b Block device c Character device s Socket p Named pipe The next nine characters are permissions: first three for user (u), middle three for group (g), last three for others (o). (Acronym: ugo).\nPermissions mean slightly different things for files vs. directories:\nPermission File Directory Read View file content List contents of the directory Write Change content, rename, or delete Add or delete files/subdirectories within it Execute Run file as a program Enter the directory (cd), search it, or access file metadata Check any file/dir permissions with ls -ld.\nIn Fedora and RHEL, new users get their own group with the same name. This is the User Private Group (UPG) scheme.\n4.4.1 Using chmod (Numeric) to Change Permissions r = 4; w = 2; x = 1\n1 chmod -R 755 ~/myfile Recursively (-R) sets ~/myfile and its contents to 755 (rwxr-xr-x).\n4.4.2 Using chmod (Symbolic) to Change Permissions 1 chmod ug+rx files 1 chmod -R o-x ~/myfile 4.4.3 Using umask for Default Permissions Normal user defaults: files rw-rw-r--, directories rwxrwxr-x. Root user defaults: files rw-r--r--, directories rwxr-xr-x. These are set by umask. Type umask to see the value (e.g., 0002).\nThe umask value is subtracted from 666 (files) or 777 (dirs). A umask of 002 results in 775 for dirs and 644 for files (execution bits are off by default for files).\nTo change umask temporarily: umask [value]. Example: umask 000 creates wide-open files/dirs. To make it permanent, add the umask command to your .bashrc file. 4.4.4 Changing File Ownership Only root can change ownership.\n1 chown user:group /etc/file Changes /etc/file to be owned by user and group. Use -R for recursive changes. To change just the owner: chown yexca /etc/file.\n4.5 Moving, Copying, and Deleting Files mv, cp, rm, rmdir\nmv -i: interactive mode, prevents accidental overwrites. mv -b: creates a backup of existing files before overwriting.\ncp -a: Archive mode, preserves timestamps and attributes.\nrm -f: Force delete, ignores non-existent files and never prompts. (Be careful with rm -rf /).\n","date":"2022-09-25T20:35:02+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/75/","title":"Linux Learning Chapter 4: Moving Around the File System"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Introduction Humans always pursue something better once they have the basics; desire is endless.

Theoretically, it can be replicated on any platform that supports Docker.\nAdjusted the domain to link.start.icu. Originally there was no .icu, but the browser couldn\u0026rsquo;t resolve it without a TLD, so I added it (strangely, it looks better now).

Note: Deployed using Docker Desktop. Since the process is almost identical to last time , I won\u0026rsquo;t repeat the deployment steps.\nLogging into Docker Hub Apparently, you need to log in to use docker pull on some setups.\nFirst, register an account on the official site: Docker Hub Then initialize credentials by running:\n1 gpg --generate-key After entering your info, note the string on the line below pub in the output. Copy and replace [pub] in the following command:\n1 pass init [pub] Then log in via Docker Desktop.\nAnime - Jellyfin Docker Hub: jellyfin/jellyfin Official Site: Jellyfin: The Free Software Media System 1 docker pull jellyfin/jellyfin The cover art scraping isn\u0026rsquo;t perfect.

There are other shells, such as the C shell (csh) popular among BSD UNIX users, the Korn shell (ksh) popular in UNIX System V, Dash (Ubuntu\u0026rsquo;s default shell, faster than Bash), Tcsh (an improved C shell), and Ash (very similar to the Bourne shell).\n3.1 Shell and Terminal Windows Using Terminal Windows Through the GUI, you can open a terminal emulator (sometimes called a Terminal window) to start a shell.\nMost systems open it via the Ctrl+Shift+T shortcut. In Fedora, look for it in the applications or press Alt+F2 and type gnome-terminal.\nUsing Virtual Consoles Most Linux systems with a GUI run multiple virtual consoles at startup. Besides the one running the GUI, you can open multiple shell sessions.\nSwitch virtual consoles using Ctrl+Shift+F1~F6. In Fedora, tty1 is gdm (login screen), tty2 is the first desktop, tty3 is the second (plain text), and so on.\nCommand Prompt For regular users, the default prompt is a simple dollar sign:\n$\nFor the root user, the default prompt is a pound sign (also known as a number sign or hash tag):\n#\nA vivid illustration of the US root being in the UK.\n3.2 Choosing a Shell Use the who command to display the current logged-in username, the virtual console, and the login time.\nUse grep username /etc/passwd. The end of the output shows the default shell being used.\nYou can switch shells by typing the command for it, such as ksh, tcsh, csh, sh, dash, or others (assuming they are installed).\nLearning Bash is important not just because it\u0026rsquo;s the default in most installs, but because it\u0026rsquo;s the standard for most Linux certification exams.\n3.3 Running Commands While many commands run just by typing their name, it\u0026rsquo;s common to follow them with options and arguments to change their behavior.\n3.3.1 Understanding Command Syntax Most commands have one or more options to modify behavior. Options are usually a single letter preceded by a hyphen -. You can combine multiple single-letter options or use a hyphen for each.\nSome options are full words, usually preceded by a double hyphen --. For example, to use the help option, you type --help. Typing -help would be interpreted as four options: -h, -e, -l, and -p. While some commands don\u0026rsquo;t follow the double-hyphen rule, most do for word-based options.\nMost commands also accept arguments after options or at the end of the line. An argument is a block of extra info, like a filename, directory, username, or device. You can usually use any number of arguments as long as you don\u0026rsquo;t exceed the total character limit of the command line.\nSometimes an argument is associated with an option and must follow it immediately. For single-letter options, the argument is usually after a space. For full-word options, the argument follows an equals sign =.\nExample:\n1 tar -cvf backup.tar /home/yexca The options mean create (c) a file (f) named backup.tar containing all files in /home/yexca, and show verbose details (v) once finished. Since backup.tar is an argument for the f option, it must follow it.\n1 ls --hide=Desktop The --hide option tells ls not to show the file or directory named Desktop. Note there is no space between the option and the argument.\nOther commands to try: The uname command shows the system type. Add the -a option to see the hostname and kernel version.\nWhen logged in, Linux assigns you an identity including a username, group name, user ID (UID), and group ID (GID). It also tracks the session time and location. Use the id command to see identity info.\nDistros with SELinux (Security Enhanced Linux) enabled show extra info at the end of id output, like:\ncontext=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023\nSELinux provides a way to strictly lock down Linux system security.\nUse who -uH to add idle time and process ID info (u) and print headers (H).\nIDLE shows how long the shell has been open without input. PID is the Process ID of the login shell. COMMENT shows the remote computer name (if logging in over a network) or the local X Display name (if using a Terminal window), such as :0.0.\n3.3.2 Finding Commands To find the command you typed, the shell searches through a \u0026ldquo;path\u0026rdquo;. For commands not in the path, you must provide the full path to the executable.\nUse echo $PATH to see the shell\u0026rsquo;s PATH environment variable.\nReference: Linux bin Directory - yexca’Blog Unlike some other OSs, Linux does not check the current directory for executables by default before searching the path. It only runs an executable in the current directory if it\u0026rsquo;s in the PATH or if you provide an absolute or relative path.\nNot all commands are in the PATH directories. Some are built into the shell. You can also override commands using aliases. Here is the order the shell uses to check input:\nAliases: Names set by the alias command. Type alias to see current ones.\nShell Reserved Words: Words reserved by the shell for special purposes.\nFunctions: Groups of commands that run together in the current shell.\nBuilt-in Commands: Commands built into the shell with no external file, like cd, echo, exit, pwd, history, fg (bring background command to foreground), set (set shell options), and type (show command location).\nFile System Commands: Commands stored in the computer\u0026rsquo;s file system (represented by the PATH variable).\nTo find where a command comes from, use type or which. Use type -a to show all known locations of a command.\nIf a command isn\u0026rsquo;t in the PATH, use locate to find it. locate can access any reachable part of the system.\nlocate searches the entire file system, not just command directories. If it can\u0026rsquo;t find a recently added file, run updatedb as root to update the database.\n3.4 Using Command History Repeating long, complex, or error-prone commands saves a lot of trouble.\n3.4.1 Command Line Editing By default, Bash uses Emacs-based command line editing. If you prefer vi, add set -o vi to your .bashrc file.\nNavigation Keys: Key Name Meaning Ctrl+F Forward one char Move forward one character Ctrl+B Backward one char Move backward one character Alt+F Forward one word Move forward one word Alt+B Backward one word Move backward one word Ctrl+A Start of line Go to the beginning of the line Ctrl+E End of line Go to the end of the line Ctrl+L Clear screen Clear screen, leave cursor at top Editing Keys: Key Name Meaning Ctrl+D Delete current Delete character at cursor Backspace Delete previous Delete character before cursor Ctrl+T Swap characters Swap current and previous characters Alt+T Swap words Swap current and previous words Alt+U Uppercase word Change current word to uppercase Alt+L Lowercase word Change current word to lowercase Alt+C Capitalize Capitalize the first letter of the word Ctrl+V Insert special Add a special character (e.g., a Tab) Cut and Paste Keys: Key Name Meaning Ctrl+K Cut to end Cut all characters after the cursor Ctrl+U Cut to start Cut all characters before the cursor Ctrl+W Cut prev word Cut the word before the cursor Alt+D Cut next word Cut the word after the cursor Ctrl+Y Paste current Paste the most recently cut text Alt+Y Paste earlier Cycle back to earlier cut text and paste Ctrl+C Delete line Delete the entire command line 3.4.2 Command Line Completion To reduce typing, Bash provides tab completion. Type a few characters and hit Tab. Bash can complete:\nCommands, aliases, or functions. Variables: If the text starts with $. Usernames: If the text starts with ~. ~username represents that user\u0026rsquo;s home directory. Hostnames: If the text starts with @, using entries from /etc/hosts. To add hostnames from other files, set the HOSTFILE variable to that filename (using the same format as /etc/hosts).\nIf there are multiple matches, double-tap Tab to list them all.\n3.4.3 Repeating History Commands Every line you type is saved to the shell\u0026rsquo;s history list.\nUse history to see the list, or add a number to see the most recent entries.\nUse the exclamation mark ! to rerun commands. These execute immediately without confirmation.\n!n \u0026mdash; Run command by number. e.g., !255. !! \u0026mdash; Run the previous command. !?string? \u0026mdash; Run the command containing the string. Besides running history directly, you can find and edit specific commands:\nKey Function Description Arrow keys orCtrl+P \u0026amp; Ctrl+N Step Traverse history list line by line Ctrl+R Reverse search Incremental search backward. Matches appear as you type Ctrl+S Forward search Incremental search forward (doesn\u0026rsquo;t work in all terminals) Alt+P Reverse search Search backward for a string. Hit Enter to see the match Alt+N Forward search Search forward for a string You can also use the fc command. Typing fc followed by a number or range (e.g., fc 233 255) opens those commands in a text editor (default is vi). When you close the editor, the commands run sequentially.\nWhen the shell closes, history is saved to .bash_history in your home directory (default limit is 1000 lines).\nTo exit without saving history, use kill -9 PID on the shell process.\nSetting HISTFILE to /dev/null or clearing HISTSIZE won\u0026rsquo;t stop the save if the shell exits normally.\n3.5 Connecting and Expanding Commands The real power of the shell lies in redirecting input/output between commands or files.\nShells use metacharacters to link or expand requests. These include |, \u0026amp;, ;, ), (, \u0026lt;, and \u0026gt;.\n3.5.1 Pipes Between Commands The pipe | connects the output of one command to the input of another. Example:\n1 cat /etc/passwd | sort | less This lists the contents of /etc/passwd, sorts them, and sends the result to less for viewing.\n3.5.2 Sequential Commands Use a semicolon ; to separate multiple commands on one line. Example:\n1 date ; troff -me VertLargeDocument | lpr ; date This formats a large document and shows the time before and after.\n3.5.3 Background Commands For long-running tasks, use the ampersand \u0026amp; to run them in the background. Example:\n1 troff -me VertLargeDocument | lpr \u0026amp; Don\u0026rsquo;t close the shell or kill the process before it finishes, or the task will terminate.\n3.5.4 Command Expansion Command substitution lets you use the output of one command as an argument for another.\nThe two forms are $(command) and command (backticks).\nExample:\n1 vi $(find /home | grep xyzzy) The shell runs the substitution first: find looks in /home, grep filters for \u0026ldquo;xyzzy\u0026rdquo;, and vi opens the resulting files one by one.\nNote: Don\u0026rsquo;t run this from the root directory or you might try to edit thousands of files.\n3.5.5 Arithmetic Expansion To pass arithmetic results to a command, use $[expression] or $((expression)). Example:\n1 echo \u0026#34;I am $[2022-1957] years old\u0026#34; Output: I am 65 years old.\n1 echo \u0026#34;There are $((ls | wc -w)) files in this directory\u0026#34; This counts the files (ls | wc -w) and outputs the number.\n3.5.6 Variable Expansion Use the dollar sign $ to expand variables. It prints the value of the variable, not the name. Example:\n1 ls -l $BASH Prints the long listing for the bash command: -rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 1390064 Jan 20 2022 /usr/bin/bash.\n3.6 Using Shell Variables The shell uses variables to store session info. Use set to see all variables.\nA subset of these are environment variables, which are passed to new shells opened from the current one. Use env to see these.\nSystem files also set variables for mail, paths, and config locations. Prefix the name with $ to reference the value.\nMany variables are preset at startup. Here are some common ones:\nVariable Description BASH Full path to the Bash command. Usually /bin/bash BASH_VERSION The version number of Bash EUID Effective User ID. Assigned from /etc/passwd at startup FCEDIT Editor used by the fc command. Default is vi HISTFILE Location of the history file, usually $HOME/.bash_history HISTFILESIZE Max history entries. Older ones are dropped when limit is reached HISTCMD Returns the current command number in the history list HOME Home directory HOSTTYPE System architecture (e.g., i386, x86_64) MAIL Mailbox location, usually /var/spool/mail/$USER OLDPWD The previous working directory OSTYPE OS identification (e.g., Linux or Linux-gnu) PATH Colon-separated list of directories searched for commands PPID Process ID of the parent process PROMPT_COMMAND A command to run before displaying the prompt PS1 Main shell prompt. PS2, PS3, etc., are for extra prompts PWD Current working directory RANDOM Generates a random number from 0-32767 SECONDS Seconds since the shell started SHLVL Shell nesting level. Increments when you start a sub-shell TMOUT Auto-logout time in seconds if the shell is idle 3.6.1 Creating and Using Aliases Use alias to list or create aliases.\n1 alias p=\u0026#39;pwd ; ls -CF\u0026#39; Running p now runs pwd then ls -CF. Use unalias to remove it.\n3.6.2 Exiting the Shell Type exit or press Ctrl+D.\n3.7 Customizing Your Shell Environment 3.7.1 Shell Configuration Multiple config files determine shell behavior:\nFile Description /etc/profile System-wide environment info for all users at login. Collects settings from /etc/profile.d /etc/bashrc Runs for every Bash shell. Sets default prompt and aliases ~/.bash_profile User-specific login settings. Usually sets environment variables and runs .bashrc ~/.bashrc Specific to Bash. Read at login and every new shell. Best place for aliases ~/.bash_logout Runs at logout. Usually clears the screen To change /etc/profile or /etc/bashrc, you need root access. It\u0026rsquo;s better to create /etc/profile.d/custom.sh for system-wide changes instead of editing the main files.\nnano Editor A simple text editor. Ctrl+O to save, Ctrl+X to exit.\n3.7.2 Setting the Prompt The prompt is set by the PS1 variable. Special characters include:\nCharacter Description \\! Current command history number \\# Command number in the current session \\$ $ for users, # for root \\W Basename of current directory \\[ Start of non-printing characters (for colors/bolding) \\] End of non-printing characters \\\\ Backslash \\d Date (Day Month Date) \\h Hostname \\n Newline \\nnn Character represented by octal number nnn \\s Shell name \\t Current time (HH:MM:SS) \\u Username \\w Full path of current directory Temporary change: export PS1=\u0026quot;[\\t\\w]\\$\u0026quot;\nPermanent change: Add the PS1 value to ~/.bashrc.\nRead more: Bash Prompt HOWTO 3.7.3 Adding Environment Variables You might want to add variables to .bashrc:\nTMOUT \u0026mdash; Seconds before auto-logout. PATH \u0026mdash; Search directories. To add /home/yexca/bin: PATH=$PATH:/home/yexca/bin ; export PATH This reads the current PATH, appends the new one, and exports it. Never add . (current directory) to your PATH for security reasons.\nCustom Variables: Create shortcuts for your workflow. MYWORKDIR=/home/yexca/work ; export MYWORKDIR Then just use cd $MYWORKDIR. 3.8 Getting Info on Commands Some commands are built into the shell. Use help | less or help command for info.\nMost commands support the --help or -h option.\nUse info and man command for in-depth documentation.\nManual (man) pages are the standard for Linux documentation. They are divided into 8 sections:\nSection Name Description 1 User Commands Commands run by normal users 2 System Calls Kernel programming functions 3 C Library Functions Interface functions for programming libraries 4 Devices and Special Files Files representing hardware/software devices 5 File Formats File types and config file formats 6 Games Games on the system 7 Miscellaneous Overviews of protocols, file systems, etc. 8 Admin Tools Commands requiring root/admin privileges Use man -k to search the database. If there are no results, run mandb as root to initialize it.\nUse man 5 passwd to view section 5 specifically.\nNavigate using Page Up/Down or Enter/Arrow keys. Search using / followed by the string. n for next match, N for previous. Press q to exit.\n","date":"2022-09-12T15:04:10+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/69/","title":"Linux Learning Chapter 3: Using the Shell"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Introduction Since we\u0026rsquo;ve already covered the Windows command line, we can\u0026rsquo;t skip Linux.\nWindows article: Downloading YouTube videos via Command Line Download yt-dlp I recommend setting up a Python environment first, then heading to Releases · yt-dlp/yt-dlp · GitHub to download yt-dlp.

Although the final result was, well, something, I learned quite a bit along the way.\nThe Start Searching openwrt connect shenlan authentication on the browser led me to a post on Ensine Wireless Forum . In the replies, I found an open-source project: coffeehat/BIT-srun-login-script . This project showed me there was a Go version supporting multiple platforms, including OpenWRT, so I started tinkering.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the project author\u0026rsquo;s article: Analysis and Python Implementation of Shenlan Campus Network Login - BIT Version Before Tinkering OpenWRT versions didn\u0026rsquo;t provide compiled binaries (IPK files). My limited skills meant I couldn\u0026rsquo;t understand the README. I asked a classmate, who told me it was a Linux command. However, after trying it, I realized it was for compiling the Linux kernel. I gave up on trying on my physical machine and started using a virtual machine.\nReference: Building a custom kernel/zh-cn - Fedora Project Wiki Let\u0026rsquo;s Tinker A friend sent me configuration - How to fix make error \u0026ldquo;No rule to make target \u0026lsquo;menuconfig\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; when building a kernel for Beagleboard? - Unix \u0026amp; Linux Stack Exchange , so I followed its advice.\nSetting Up a Virtual Machine I\u0026rsquo;m using Fedora\u0026rsquo;s built-in virtualization software, \u0026ldquo;Boxes.\u0026rdquo; First, I tried installing CentOS 8. My ISO was on an external drive, so I mounted it and selected it. It failed to create the VM. I tried CentOS 7, failed. Then Ubuntu, failed.\nAfter multiple failures, I almost doubted the software, even though I\u0026rsquo;d successfully created a Windows 10 VM with it before. I opened the error log, but it was gibberish. However, I noticed a Chinese character in a path. I changed the path to English and tried again. Failed.\nThe next day, I thought, since it\u0026rsquo;s about kernel compilation, maybe Kali Linux would work. I copied the Kali ISO from my USB to my computer. Although the installation ultimately failed, it ran successfully. Did the system need to be local?\nSo, I copied the CentOS 7 ISO to ~/Documents/ and the installation succeeded. Since I only needed to compile an IPK, I used the root user.\nConnecting to the Network I assumed creating a Linux VM in Linux would automatically share the network. So, I directly ran wget https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.19.6.tar.xz. The result was \u0026ldquo;cannot resolve host.\u0026rdquo; Using ifconfig, I saw no IP address.\nI followed the guide Setting Static IP in a Virtual Machine (CentOS Example) to get the VM online. For file modification, I just needed to change ONBOOT to yes and add two DNS entries.\nInstalling Git After getting online, I installed Git using yum install git. Then, I configured my name and email.\n1 git config --global user.name \u0026#34;Name\u0026#34; 1 git config --global user.email \u0026#34;email@example.com\u0026#34; Transferring Files I continued trying to download the Linux kernel using wget. I tried three or four times, with downloads failing around 50% and at very slow speeds.\nNote: Using wget -c URL allows for resuming interrupted downloads.\nThen, the \u0026ldquo;Boxes\u0026rdquo; software seemed to support direct drag-and-drop. I downloaded the file on my main computer and dragged it over. It failed. The file wasn\u0026rsquo;t transferred. Considering the target location was ~/Downloads/ and I was using the root account, I followed Adding Users and Administrator Users in Linux to create a new user. (I almost ran the step to delete the user.)\nI switched to the new user with su username, created the ~/Downloads/ directory, and dragged the file again. Still failed.\nI tried using Boxes\u0026rsquo; sharing feature to share my computer\u0026rsquo;s ~/Public folder. No matter how I tried, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t see it in the VM. (I suspect this software only works well with RHEL and Fedora.)\nSSH Transfer Then I remembered SSH transfer (because ftp wasn\u0026rsquo;t installed, and I was too lazy to install it).\nI enabled SSH on my local machine and then used the scp command to transfer files via SSH.\n1 scp username@servername:/path/filename ~/Downloads/ First, I needed the IP address. In the VM, I ran ip route and got the IP: 10.0.2.2.\nThen, I used the scp command to transfer.\nExtracting Files I used the tar command to extract the files.\n1 tar -xzvf filename.tar.xz Uh oh, this isn\u0026rsquo;t a gzip compressed file. How do I extract it?\nSSH Transfer I\u0026rsquo;ll use SSH transfer again. Just add -r to the scp command to transfer directories.\nFirst Attempt Following the steps, I placed the extracted files in /usr/src/. I copied the config file from /boot to /usr/src/linux-5.19.6/.config. However, whether I put the config file in .config/ or .config, the make menuconfig command still wouldn\u0026rsquo;t run.\nConclusion Tinkering failed. I\u0026rsquo;ll try again later.\nHowever, while writing this article, I noticed the original post suggested running Python directly on OpenWRT. I\u0026rsquo;ll try that if I have time.\nAnother Attempt I consulted a friend who had successfully connected to the school network (though he used a regular router). He changed his router\u0026rsquo;s MAC address to his computer\u0026rsquo;s. Then, when he plugged in the network cable, the authentication page automatically forwarded to his computer. After authenticating, he had internet access, but it was through Ruijie\u0026rsquo;s web authentication.\nConsidering Shenlan uses Portal authentication (web page authentication), and it\u0026rsquo;s web-based, can I authenticate by modifying HTTP packets? Are there Linux commands to send HTTP packets? I searched and found curl and wget can simulate get and post requests. (So I opened Fiddler to capture packets, trying to replicate the authentication process.)\nJust kidding. I connected my router to the school network, then connected my computer to the router via Ethernet cable. I entered the IP address of the authentication page, completed authentication, and the router had internet access.\nSimulating HTTP GET or POST Requests with Linux Commands Although I didn\u0026rsquo;t end up using them, I\u0026rsquo;ll document them since I found them.\nGET Request curl 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ## If the URL points to a file, it can be downloaded directly curl URL ## Display all information curl -i URL ## Display only header information curl -l URL ## Show the full parsing process of the GET request curl -v URL wget 1 wget URL POST Request curl 1 2 3 4 5 6 ## Use the -d parameter to include parameters in the request curl -d \u0026#34;param1=value1\u0026amp;param2=value2\u0026#34; \u0026#34;URL\u0026#34; curl -d \u0026#39;param1=value1\u0026amp;param2=value2\u0026#39; -X POST URL curl -d \u0026#39;param1=value1\u0026#39; -d \u0026#39;param2=value2\u0026#39; -X POST URL wget 1 2 ## Use the --post-data parameter wget --post-data \u0026#39;user=name\u0026amp;passwd=passwd\u0026#39; URL Another Conclusion Sometimes, you can overcomplicate things. A simple solution might be overlooked if you only think about it and dismiss it without trying. This whole detour happened because I initially dismissed the \u0026ldquo;Another Attempt\u0026rdquo; part. (If my data plan wasn\u0026rsquo;t so limited, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have bothered trying.)\nAs I write this, two famous quotes come to mind:\nLearning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous.\nExperience is the mother of all knowledge.\nSo, sometimes you should just go for it and try, don\u0026rsquo;t let overthinking limit you!\nReferences Asking for Help: How to Flash Firmware for Shenlan Campus Network Portal Authentication? - Xiaomi Wireless Routers and Xiaomi Wireless Related Devices - Ensine Wireless Forum configuration - How to fix make error \u0026ldquo;No rule to make target \u0026lsquo;menuconfig\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; when building a kernel for Beagleboard? - Unix \u0026amp; Linux Stack Exchange Setting Static IP in a Virtual Machine (CentOS Example) - yexca\u0026rsquo;Blog Installing Git - Leo Xuefeng\u0026rsquo;s Official Website Adding Users and Administrator Users in Linux - yexca\u0026rsquo;Blog How to Switch Between Users in Linux System_M Li Li\u0026rsquo;s Blog - CSDN Blog_linux switch system Using SSH to Transfer Files - SegmentFault Linux tar Command - CoderBae Portal Authentication Principles - Cao Shihong\u0026rsquo;s Blog Linux Command to Send Http GET or POST Requests (curl and wget methods)_cyl937\u0026rsquo;s Blog - CSDN Blog ","date":"2022-09-05T21:24:23+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/66/","title":"Tinkering with OpenWRT for Shenlan Network Authentication"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash Intro I stumbled upon YouTube-dl and found it super handy for downloading entire channels. The only catch was the webm format it outputted isn\u0026rsquo;t always compatible. So, I looked into ffmpeg commands for format conversion.\nConfig File Later, I realized a simple config file tweak would do the trick. Just add this line to your config:\n1 --merge-output-format mp4 Here\u0026rsquo;s my full config file:\n1 -o \u0026#39;C:/Users/yexca/Downloads/Video/%(uploader)s/%(upload_date)s%(title)s%(id)s.%(ext)s\u0026#39; --merge-output-format mp4 Single Command You can quickly transcode with this command:\n1 ffmpeg -i before.webm after.mp4 But doing it one by one is way too slow, which led me to think about batch processing.\nBatch Processing Create a new Notepad file and paste this code:\n1 for %%a in (*.webm) do ffmpeg -i \u0026#34;%%~a\u0026#34; -vcodec copy -f mp4 \u0026#34;%%~na.mp4\u0026#34; Here, (*.webm) is the original file type, and \\\u0026quot;%%~na.mp4\\\u0026quot; is the desired output file type.\nSave it as run.bat, drop it into the target folder, and run it.\nHowever, having to edit it every time for different files isn\u0026rsquo;t super practical.\nDOS Script So, I dove a bit into .bat files and quickly whipped up the following script (FYI: GB2312 encoding is needed for proper Chinese output in the command line).\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 echo off :0 echo Please enter a number to select an operation echo 1.

(Note: Reading the book and writing this took 5 days).\nHTTP Message Structure There are two types of HTTP messages: Request and Response.\nHTTP Request An HTTP request consists of three parts: the Request Line, the Request Headers, and the Body.\nThe first line (Request Line) contains the Method, URI, and protocol version. Example: GET https://blog.yexca.net/ HTTP/2 The second part is the Headers. The third part is the Body. Note: There is an empty line between the Headers and the Body.\nHTTP Response The structure of an HTTP response is basically the same as a request, also divided into three parts: the Response Line (Status Line), the Response Headers, and the Body.\nThe first line contains the protocol version, status code, and status message. Example: HTTP/2 200 The second part is the Headers. The third part is the Body. Note: There is an empty line between the Headers and the Body.\nHTTP Methods and Status Codes URL Format URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It\u0026rsquo;s used to describe the address of a resource on the Internet.\nThe basic format of a URL is:\nschema://host[:port#]/path/.../[?query-string][#anchor]\nAttribute Description schema Specifies the underlying protocol (e.g., http, https, ftp) host The IP address or domain name of the HTTP server port# The default port for HTTP is 80; it can be omitted if using the default. Otherwise, it must be specified path The path to the resource query-string Data sent to the HTTP server anchor An internal page hyperlink HTTP Request Methods No. Method Description 1 GET Requests a specific resource and returns the entity body 2 HEAD Similar to GET, but the response has no body; used to retrieve headers 3 POST Submits data to be processed (e.g., form submission or file upload). Data is included in the body. May create new resources or modify existing ones 4 PUT Replaces the content of the target resource with the uploaded data 5 DELETE Requests the server to delete the specified resource GET vs. POST GET data is appended to the URL, separated by a ? (query-string, key-value pairs), and parameters are connected with \u0026amp;. POST puts data in the HTTP message Body. GET has size limits (due to browser URL length limits). POST has no size limits for data. In code, GET typically uses Request.QueryString to get variables, while POST uses Request.Form. HTTP Status Codes Status codes are in the HTTP response. The server uses them to tell the client what happened. They are divided into five categories.\nStatus Code Defined Range Category 1XX 100–101 Informational: Request received, continue processing 2XX 200–206 Success: Request successfully received, understood, and accepted 3XX 300–305 Redirection: Further action needed to complete the request 4XX 400–415 Client Error: Request has bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled 5XX 500–505 Server Error: Server failed to fulfill a valid request Common Status Codes Name Meaning 200 OK: Server successfully processed the request 301/302 Moved Permanently / Found (Redirect): The URL has moved. The response should contain a Location URL 304 Not Modified: Client\u0026rsquo;s cached version is up to date; use the cache 404 Not Found: Resource not found 401 Unauthorized: Authentication required 501 Not Implemented (Source mentions Internal Server Error): Server encountered an error 206 (Partial Content) The 206 status code means the server successfully processed a partial GET request. This is used for resumable downloads or online video streaming.\nExample of a video request:\nBrowser sends GET with Header: Range: bytes=5303296-5336063. Server returns 206 with Header: Content-Range: bytes 5303296-5336063/12129376. 301 vs. 302 (Redirects) After receiving 301 or 302, the browser makes a new request to the URL in the Location header.\n301: Old address is permanently moved. Search engines transfer authority to the new URL. (e.g., switching domains). 302: Old address still exists; the redirect is temporary. (e.g., redirecting to a login page). 304 (Not Modified) Indicates the cached version is still valid and can be used.\n400 (Bad Request) Syntax error in the client request. The server cannot understand it (e.g., malformed form data or corrupted Cookies).\n401 (Unauthorized) Authentication error. Used when HTTP Basic Authentication is required but the Authorization header is missing or invalid.\n404 (Not Found) Server cannot find the resource. Can also be used to hide a resource (refuse request without reason). For example, BV1AB4y1D7Ft is only visible if logged in and favorited; otherwise, it returns 404.\n403 (Forbidden) The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it. Unlike 401, re-authenticating makes no difference.\n500 (Internal Server Error) Generic server error. Could be code bugs, DB connection issues, uncaught exceptions, or null pointers.\n503 (Server Unavailable) Server is temporarily unable to handle the request (overloaded or down for maintenance).\nFull list of status codes Visit: HTTP Status Codes - Runoob HTTP Headers Headers use the \u0026ldquo;key: value\u0026rdquo; format, one per line.\nCache-related Headers Both requests and responses use headers for caching. Caching allows retrieving files from local storage instead of the original server.\nCookie A type of HTTP cache/storage. Key-value format (e.g., ip_country=CN). Browsers send them via the \u0026ldquo;Cookie\u0026rdquo; header; servers set them via \u0026ldquo;Set-Cookie\u0026rdquo;.\nAccept Media types the client can handle. Accept: text/html means the browser wants HTML. * is a wildcard.\nAccept-Encoding Related to compression. The browser tells the server which compression algorithms it supports (e.g., Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate).\nAccept-Language The languages the client understands (e.g., Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8,zh-CN;q=0.6). Note: language $\\neq$ character set.\nUser-Agent Identifies the client\u0026rsquo;s OS, browser version, engine, etc. Example: User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:103.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/103.0.\nReferer Indicates the source page the user came from. Used for analytics and hotlink protection.\nConnection In HTTP/1.1, Connection: Keep-Alive is default. It keeps the TCP connection open for multiple requests.\nHost Specifies the target host and port. Port 80 is usually hidden.\nHTTP Caching Caching exists at the browser, server, and proxy levels. It reduces redundant data, saves time, and lowers server load.\nJudging Cache Freshness The server checks cache validity in two ways:\nLast-Modified / If-Modified-Since: Browser sends the last modification time. If the file hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed, the server returns 304. ETag / If-None-Match: Browser sends a unique hash (ETag) of the file content. Cache Headers Request Headers Name Description Cache-Control: max-age=0 Force revalidation If-Modified-Since Last modification time of the cached file If-None-Match ETag value of the cached file Cache-Control: no-cache Do not use cache Pragma: no-cache Do not use cache (Legacy) Response Headers Name Description Cache-Control: public Can be cached by public proxies/users Cache-Control: private Cache only for specific user Cache-Control: no-cache Must validate with server before using cache Cache-Control: no-store Never cache (for sensitive data) Cache-Control: max-age=60 Cache expires in 60s (relative) Date Time response was sent Expires Absolute expiration time Last-Modified Last modification time on server Etag Unique hash of the server file Note: Cache-Control takes precedence over Expires.\nETag Entity Tag. A hash string representing the file state. It solves issues where Last-Modified isn\u0026rsquo;t precise enough (it only goes down to the second) or where modification times change but content doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nForcing No Cache Ctrl+Shift+R forces a refresh, adding Cache-Control: no-cache to the request.\nDirect Cache Use Typing the URL in the address bar usually results in a \u0026ldquo;cache hit\u0026rdquo; if valid, without even checking the server.\nCompression and URL Encoding HTTP compression reduces the size of text content (HTML, JS, CSS) during transfer.\nCompression Process Browser sends Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate. Server generates response, compresses the Body with gzip, updates Content-Length, and adds Content-Encoding: gzip. Browser receives response and decompresses it. Note: Browsers usually don\u0026rsquo;t compress requests.\nEncoding Types Encoding Description gzip GNU zip compress UNIX compress deflate zlib format identity No encoding (Default) gzip is the most efficient and widely used.\nDeep Dive into Cookies HTTP is stateless. Each request is independent. Sessions solve this by maintaining state between the browser and server.\nSessions vs. Cookies Server creates a session and sends the Session ID to the browser. Browser stores the ID and sends it back in subsequent requests. Server identifies the user via the ID. Cookies are the mechanism browsers use to store this ID.\nWhat are Cookies? Small data stored as key=value pairs, separated by semicolons. Primarily used for authentication, user preferences, and ad tracking. Some regions (EU) have laws requiring user consent for cookies.\nCookie Attributes Expires: When it expires. If omitted, it\u0026rsquo;s a session cookie (deleted when browser closes). Path: The scope of the cookie. / means the whole site. HttpOnly: Prevents JavaScript from reading the cookie. Essential for security against XSS. Categories Session Cookie: Temporary, stored in memory. Persistent Cookie: Stored on disk with an expiration date. Used for \u0026ldquo;auto-login.\u0026rdquo; HTTP Basic Authentication Used by some desktop apps and routers. The client sends username:password encoded in Base64 via the Authorization header.\nProcess:\nServer returns 401 and a WWW-Authenticate header. Browser prompts for credentials. Browser sends Base64 encoded credentials. Disadvantages Stateless: Every request must be authenticated. Insecure: Base64 is easily reversed. Must use HTTPS. No Logout: Cannot log out without closing the browser or clearing history. Vulnerable to replay attacks. Digest Authentication An improved version of Basic Auth. It uses hashes (MD5) and a \u0026ldquo;nonce\u0026rdquo; (number used once) from the server to prevent password sniffing and replay attacks.\nReferences “Graphing HTTP” Summary - yexca\u0026rsquo;Blog HTTP Status Codes - Runoob Cookie locations in IE/Firefox/Chrome Replay Attack - Wikipedia What is a REST API?

We\u0026rsquo;ll use Windows as an example.\nYour id_rsa.pub file is stored in %UserProfile%/.ssh/.\nIf it\u0026rsquo;s not there, just open cmd and run ssh-keygen; it\u0026rsquo;ll generate one for you.\nImport Public Key Import the public key (or keys) into /home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys, one per line. If the file doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, create it:\n1 2 3 4 5 cd /home/git/ mkdir .ssh chmod 755 .ssh touch .ssh/authorized_keys chmod 644 .ssh/authorized_keys Then use vi or vim to import the public key. For vim usage, check out: Vim Text Editing Initialize Git Repository Pick a directory for your Git repo. Let\u0026rsquo;s say /home/gitrepo/repo.git.\n1 2 3 4 5 cd /home mkdir gitrepo chown git:git gitrepo cd gitrepo git init --bare repo.git The commands above create a bare Git repository. Server-side Git repos usually end with .git. Next, change the repo\u0026rsquo;s owner to the git user:\n1 chown -R git:git runoob.git Clone Repository 1 2 3 git clone git@YourIP:RepoDirectory // For example git clone git@127.0.0.1:/home/gitrepo/repo.git Sync Directory The auto-sync feature uses Git hooks.\nNavigate to your repo directory: /home/gitrepo/repo.git\n1 2 cd /home/gitrepo/repo.git cd hooks Create and edit the post-receive file:\n1 vi post-receive Add the following content to the file:\n1 2 #!/bin/sh git --work-tree=SyncTargetDirectory --git-dir=RepoLocation checkout -f For example:\n1 2 #!/bin/sh git --work-tree=/home/www/hexo --git-dir=/home/gitrepo/repo.git checkout -f Then set read/write permissions for the file:\n1 chmod +x post-receive Change the owner of the repo.git directory to the git user.\n1 chown -R git:git /home/gitrepo/repo.git Update Code If you\u0026rsquo;re sure nothing\u0026rsquo;s changed and you just need to update local code, simply use:\n1 git pull The proper workflow:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 // Check local branch file status to avoid conflicts during update. git status // If files are modified, you can revert them to the original state; if files need to be updated to the server, you should merge to the server first, then update locally. git checkout – [file name] // Check current branch status. git branch // If it\u0026#39;s a local branch, you need to switch to the remote branch on the server. git checkout remote branch git pull Other Commands 1 2 3 4 git branch // Check branches git checkout aaa // Switch to branch \u0026#39;aaa\u0026#39; git branch aaa // Create branch \u0026#39;aaa\u0026#39; git checkout -b aaa // Create branch \u0026#39;aaa\u0026#39; locally and switch to it. The branch will only be created on the server when you push. Disable Shell Login for Git User For security, we need to prevent the git user from logging in via shell. You can do this by editing /etc/passwd:\n1 vi /etc/passwd Change this:\n1 git:x:1004:1004::/home/git:/bin/bash To this:\n1 git:x:1004:1004::/home/git:/usr/bin/git-shell This way, the git user can still use Git normally via SSH, but can\u0026rsquo;t log into the shell.\nReferences Linux chown Command - Runoob Tutorial Git Server Setup - Runoob Tutorial Git - Generating Your SSH Public Key Introduction to SSH Keys and Their Use in Git - Jianshu Git - Getting Git on a Server Git: Updating Local Code - ftToday\u0026rsquo;s Blog - CSDN How to Set Up a Hexo Blog on a Server - Alibaba Cloud Developer Community Linux Permissions Explained (chmod, 600, 644, 700, 711, 755, 777, 4755, 6755, 7755) - Lin20\u0026rsquo;s Blog - CSDN Detailed Analysis of Linux /etc/passwd file - Jtianlin - Blog Garden ","date":"2022-08-13T10:28:50+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/57/","title":"Set Up Git Server and Sync to a Specific Directory"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview This article was written by Hiyoung Original article: https://blog.hiyoung.icu/2022/08/11/607cac6fe835/ Most mainstream streaming platforms support embedding code for external links.

By the time I actually understood it, RSS was already on the decline. Projects like RSSHub were keeping the flame alive, but I eventually gave up on it due to frequent connection issues. However, as I\u0026rsquo;ve discovered more blogs, I\u0026rsquo;ve returned to RSS to stay updated and keep track of what I\u0026rsquo;ve read.\nWhat is RSS? RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication. It\u0026rsquo;s a format specification for web feeds. Websites use it to provide titles, summaries, or full articles to subscribers. Users can aggregate these links into a single tool to read everything in one place.\nIn other words, while mainstream media pushes content to us (passive consumption), RSS is about actively seeking knowledge. You find your own sources, and the feed only shows what you actually subscribed to.\nWhy use RSS? Pick up your phone, open any news app, and the homepage is nothing but \u0026ldquo;recommendations.\u0026rdquo; Between infinite scrolling and big-data algorithms, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to waste a whole day on low-quality, one-sided content. I hate that feeling of time slipping away. I believe relaxation should be intentional, not passive. Using RSS is my way of resisting the \u0026ldquo;information cocoon.\u0026rdquo;\nOn a small scale, it\u0026rsquo;s about marking unread articles and following blogs I care about. On a larger scale, as recommendation algorithms get more precise, they limit our horizons. RSS helps maintain the ability to actively seek information and learn.\nHow to use it First, you need an RSS reader. I use QuiteRSS , which is open source.\nNext, you need subscription feeds. You\u0026rsquo;ll have to find these yourself. If a site doesn\u0026rsquo;t explicitly provide one, check RSSHub (ensure your network connection is stable).\nHow to find RSS feeds: How to find the RSS feed URL for Feedzy RSS Feeds For example, this site\u0026rsquo;s feed is: https://blog.yexca.net/feed.xml To check if a link is a valid feed: Feed Validator for Atom and RSS Just copy the feed URL, open your software, and create a new source.\nAfterword I had high hopes for this post, but when I actually sat down to write, I found it hard to express exactly what I was feeling. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ve been \u0026ldquo;poisoned\u0026rdquo; by too much low-quality web content for too long—I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten how to write properly.\nI had a lot of thoughts before starting, but they didn\u0026rsquo;t quite make it to the page. It is what it is.\nReferences / Recommended Reading What is the RSS for HACG?

It\u0026rsquo;s a retelling, so some details might not be exact.\nMission Brief Passed a test from some shadowy figure, got HackShop access, and then the first mission dropped.\nThe mission brief: \u0026ldquo;The client wants the login credentials of the user Daronane. The remote ip of the victim is 54.44.37.52. It\u0026rsquo;s important that you access the correct machine behind the public ip. The victim\u0026rsquo;s ip LAN is 172.16.6.7\u0026rdquo;\nMission Analysis Target: Daronane\u0026rsquo;s login. Victim\u0026rsquo;s public IP: 54.44.37.52. LAN IP: 172.16.6.7.\nInitial Probe Following Grey Hack Single Player Game Guide (1) - MapleGe \u0026rsquo;s method, I tried\u0026hellip;\nFirst, whois command for the admin email: Eggett@sabmi.net. Sent a \u0026ldquo;Login issue\u0026rdquo; email. Got Daronane\u0026rsquo;s password: pierra.\nTried ssh Daronane@pierra 54.44.37.52 to connect to 54.44.37.52. Failed. Error: incorrect user/password.\nFigured I mistyped (manual input, right?). Tried a few more times, even copy-pasting. Still incorrect user/password. Gave up on that.\nBrowsed the IP. No clues, just \u0026ldquo;Metlifegroup. Everything you need for your tech company\u0026rdquo; and a pic (Raspberry Pi?). Guessed it was a forum, and Daronane a user there?\nGame Localization Remembered missing some Exploits tutorial info when hitting HackShop. Searched for game localization. Found [简体中文](simplified Chinese) on the Workshop, subscribed, restarted. UI still English.\nFound Workshop download: steam_folder\\steamapps\\workshop\\content\\605230\\2825584160. README.md said to drop its contents into C:\\Users\\%UserName%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Loading Home\\Grey Hack\\ .\nActually, just custom_lang.json in that folder was enough.\nRestarted the game, hit language on the left, picked Chinese. Localized.\nReading the Manual Read the Exploits section in the localized manual (tbh, it felt almost the same as unlocalized). Still couldn\u0026rsquo;t wrap my head around it.\nFurther Exploration Kept digging for guides, found nada. Then hit Grey Hack: A Relatively Simple Mission - Bilibili .\nThe term \u0026ldquo;script kiddie\u0026rdquo; in the article clicked: Exploits are basically real-world attack scripts.\nMisguided Exploration Grabbed scanlib and scanrouter from HackShop.\nRan scanlib 54.44.37.52. Output: Missing metaxploit. No idea what that meant.\nnmap 54.44.37.52 showed two open ports: 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP).\nscanrouter revealed Kernel_router.so:V1.0.0 on the server. Searched for scripts, found one: \u0026ldquo;Get access to a shell\u0026rdquo;, no requirements.\nDownloaded it to /home/yexca/hacktool. Navigated there, ran KernelRouterAccess 54.44.37.52. Error: Can't find metaxploit library in the /lib path or the current folder.\nNote: Initially, I didn\u0026rsquo;t rename this script. Later, I renamed it to KernelRouterAccess for clarity in this post. Other scripts mentioned here were also renamed after initial download, differing from their store names.\nError pointed to a missing file. /lib? Was the target server missing the file, thus couldn\u0026rsquo;t recognize it and grant access?\nRethinking nmap showed ports 22/80. My guess: victim\u0026rsquo;s a forum user. So, HackShop for an HTTP script. Found one: \u0026ldquo;Grant access to the file /etc/passwd and decipher its contents.\u0026rdquo; Requirement: \u0026ldquo;Minimum number of 1 users registered in the computer\u0026rdquo;. Forum implied multiple users, unlikely they\u0026rsquo;d dev as root.\nDownloaded the script, ran HttpPasswd 54.44.37.52 80. Same error: Can't find metaxploit library in the /lib path or the current folder.\nNo surprise there. scanrouter only found Kernel_router.so:V1.0.0, no libhttp.so or anything similar.\nPicked the HTTP script because that article said: \u0026ldquo;Just get the mission done; no remote connection needed, and local script execution leaves no traces.\u0026rdquo;\nOkay, let\u0026rsquo;s retry SSH. HackShop for SSH scripts. Found one: \u0026ldquo;Take advantage of a vulnerability in the ssh service to inject a new password to a registered user.\u0026rdquo; Requirement: \u0026ldquo;Any user logged in the computer.\u0026rdquo; Devs would have logged in, so this should work.\nDownloaded, ran SSHPasswd 54.44.37.52 22. Still hit with Can't find metaxploit library in the /lib path or the current folder.\nWTF??? Is their /lib totally empty? Am I supposed to try every script type to map /lib contents? I\u0026rsquo;ll go broke!\nOn the Right Track Hit the search engine for guides. Nothing.\nRecalled the error: Can't find metaxploit library in the /lib path or the current folder. I only saw /lib and metaxploit before. But \u0026ldquo;or the current folder\u0026rdquo;? Did that mean my local script directory? Would I need to download every libssh.so-like dependency just to run an exploit?\nChecked the black market, no libssh.so or similar. Recalled apt-get exists in-game (like real Linux). Ran apt-get search ssh. Bingo, libssh.so popped up. apt-get install libssh.so to install SSH.\nInstalled. Ran SSHPasswd 54.44.37.52 22. Still got Can't find metaxploit library in the /lib path or the current folder.\nSeriously, I\u0026rsquo;m out!!!\nBack to HackShop. Scrolled through Tools. metaxploit.so jumped out. Wait, isn\u0026rsquo;t that the \u0026ldquo;metaxploit\u0026rdquo; from the error? Pair that with \u0026ldquo;current folder\u0026rdquo; – was it missing this all along?\nDownloaded it to the script dir (/home/yexca/hacktool). Since scanrouter only saw Kernel_router.so, I ran KernelRouterAccess 54.44.37.52. Boom! Access granted!\nGaining Access Got access, first thought: delete logs. FileExplorer.exe to /var/system.log. Permission denied. Guest access, great. Tried /etc/passwd for password files. Still Permission denied. (Seriously, I probed almost every file).\nUgh, what\u0026rsquo;s the point of this script then?!\nSSH script changes passwords, too risky. Switched to the HTTP script to grab passwords. HttpPasswd 54.44.37.52 80. Got: can't read /etc/passwd. Permission denied. Saw I was still guest. I was like\u0026hellip;\nEnded up using the SSH script. SSHPasswd 54.44.37.52 22, new password 114514. Successfully changed Farraze\u0026rsquo;s password.\nRan ssh Farraze@114514 54.44.37.52, got into the victim\u0026rsquo;s machine. cat /etc/passwd pulled the encrypted root password info.\nLocally, touch mima.txt, pasted the root password info, then decipher mima.txt. Root password: 44444 (seriously?).\nexit to disconnect. ssh root@44444 54.44.37.52 got me in as root.\nInside the Machine First thing inside: delete logs. Users: Ralancl, Farraze. No Daronane. Still a forum user? Scoured the machine, found zip. (Transferred their cash to my account, btw~).\nMission brief mentioned 172.16.6.7.\nping 172.16.6.7. \u0026ldquo;Ping successful\u0026rdquo;. My own machine couldn\u0026rsquo;t ping it (obvious, it\u0026rsquo;s an internal network).\nnmap 172.16.6.7 for open ports. Got command not found.\nUgh, guess I\u0026rsquo;ll have to drop my command binaries into /bin on this machine.\nCopied. Ran nmap 172.16.6.7 again. Port 3306 open, service employees. What\u0026rsquo;s employees?\nSearch engine confirmed: 3306 is usually a DB port. SQL script time.\nPassword Acquired Hit HackShop, searched scripts. Found one: \u0026ldquo;Take advantage of a vulnerability in the sql service to inject a new password to a registered user.\u0026rdquo; Requirement: \u0026ldquo;Any user logged in the computer.\u0026rdquo; DB creation implies users logged in.\nDownloaded. SqlChangePasswd 172.16.6.7 3306. Error: Connection refused. Address unreachable. Access denied. Right, DBs are usually whitelisted.\nMoved script and metaxploit.so to victim\u0026rsquo;s /root. Retried the command, set password to 114514 for user Osquel.\nOkay, now what? Password changed, but only 3306 is open. Can\u0026rsquo;t get in! XD\nAlright, back to HackShop. Script search. Found one: \u0026ldquo;Prints the contents of the file /etc/passwd\u0026rdquo;. Requirement: \u0026ldquo;Any user logged in the computer.\u0026rdquo; Same as the last one.\nDropped the script into victim\u0026rsquo;s /root. SqlPrintPasswd 172.16.6.7 3306. Got all user passwords, Daronane included.\nCopied to my machine, decrypted: password pierra.\n??? Sent the password to the client. Confirmed???\nSeriously\u0026hellip;\nEpic! (From YouTuber Hei Biaoke)\nAfterword Got the password via email from the start. Then I spent ages getting it again. (Speechless, seriously).\nGot 200, but my scripts cost way more (net loss, lol). Still, scripts are reusable, and the exploration was pretty fun!\nGuides for this game are practically nonexistent. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for one, hope this helps!\n","date":"2022-08-03T22:41:06+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/54/","title":"Logging My First Grey Hack Mission (Password Acquisition)"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by Gemini-3-flash Written by Hiyoung Original Article: https://blog.hiyoung.icu/2022/08/03/0b5e2db181ab/ I\u0026rsquo;ve been using GitHub a lot lately to store code from my learning process.

It\u0026rsquo;s definitely better to write these things down for future reference.\nIn this article, the Wi-Fi that the OpenWRT router connects to is referred to as the \u0026ldquo;upstream router,\u0026rdquo; and the OpenWRT device itself is the \u0026ldquo;router.\u0026rdquo;\nPrerequisites Ensure the LAN IP address of your router (the one used to access the web UI) is different from the upstream router\u0026rsquo;s address. If they conflict, you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to access the internet.\nChanging the Router\u0026rsquo;s LAN Address Go to Network -\u0026gt; Interfaces, click Edit for the LAN interface, and change its IPv4 address.\nFor example, if the upstream router is at 192.168.1.1, you can change your router to 192.168.5.1.\nAfter clicking Save \u0026amp; Apply, use the new address in your browser to access the router\u0026rsquo;s backend.\nConnecting the Router to Wi-Fi Go to Network -\u0026gt; Wireless, click Scan, find the Wi-Fi you want to connect to, and click Join Network. Enter the network name and password, click Submit, and then click Save \u0026amp; Apply.\nSetting up the Router\u0026rsquo;s Wi-Fi Hotspot If your router is dual-band (2.4G and 5G), it\u0026rsquo;s best to create your hotspot on a different band than the one used for the relay for maximum compatibility. (If the other band already has a Wi-Fi network active, it might already be ready to use.)\nIf you only have a single band, you must create a new network on that same band. Note that this may not always work, as some hardware doesn\u0026rsquo;t support simultaneous receiving and transmitting on a single radio.\nSetting up the Wi-Fi follows the standard process: go to Network -\u0026gt; Wireless, add a network, enter the SSID (Wi-Fi name) and password, then Save \u0026amp; Apply.\nReferences OpenWrt Advanced Tutorial: Wireless Relay Configuration Guide - iyzm.net ","date":"2022-06-23T14:50:21+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/49/","title":"OpenWRT Wireless Relaying"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-2.5-flash This article was written by Hiyoung Original article: https://blog.hiyoung.icu/2022/08/18/5be9517606f2/ Batch Process Images with Photoshop Automation Scripts Click Window -\u0026gt; Actions in the menu bar (Shortcut: Alt+F9).

Well, my miHoYo BBS cookies expired and needed replacing, so I\u0026rsquo;m documenting the process for future reference.\nTools \u0026amp; Original Tutorial Genshin Impact Helper - Yindan\u0026rsquo;s Blog The original post covers many methods, which can be a bit cluttered. This post focuses on the specific method I use.\nTencent Cloud Function Cleanup Make sure to freeze your Tencent Cloud Functions to avoid any unexpected charges.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t need the service anymore, you can cancel your account, but be aware that account deletion requires a photo of you holding your ID.\nPrerequisites Your server must be able to reach miHoYo\u0026rsquo;s servers: https://mihoyo.com Run ping mihoyo.com in your SSH terminal to verify connectivity.\nOne of my servers couldn\u0026rsquo;t connect, so I had to switch to another one.\nDocker Installation Use the official one-click script. It\u0026rsquo;s verified to work on Debian 10 and CentOS 7 (use the root account).\nInstallation command:\n1 curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | bash -s docker --mirror Aliyun For users in Mainland China, you can use the DaoCloud mirror:\n1 curl -sSL https://get.daocloud.io/docker | sh Script Installation Pull the image with the following command:\n1 docker pull yindan/genshinhelper CentOS Error I encountered a Can't Connect to Docker Daemon error on CentOS.\nEnsure you are root, then run:\n1 systemctl start docker Basic Usage Getting the Cookie To get your miHoYo Cookie, refer to: Genshin Resin Tracker/Push – yexca\u0026rsquo;Blog Note: The Cookie must include the account_id and cookie_token fields.\nFor multiple accounts, separate Cookies with a #, for example: Cookie1#Cookie2#Cookie3.\nSimple Configuration 1 2 3 4 docker run -d --name=genshinhelper \\ -e COOKIE_MIHOYOBBS=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;COOKIE_MIHOYOBBS\u0026gt;\u0026#34; \\ --restart always \\ yindan/genshinhelper:latest Just replace \u0026lt;COOKIE_MIHOYOBBS\u0026gt; with your actual Cookie.\nReconfiguring/Updating Cookies To reconfigure, you usually need to remove and redeploy the container.\nAlternatively, if using a configuration file, you just need to swap the Cookie (though Cookies tend to last a long time).\nCommon Commands 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 # View all Docker containers docker ps -a # View logs docker logs -f genshinhelper --tail 100 # Restart docker restart genshinhelper # Update docker pull yindan/genshinhelper docker rm -f genshinhelper # Then redeploy using the basic or advanced method # Uninstall docker rm -f genshinhelper docker image rm yindan/genshinhelper Advanced Usage You can download the example file and modify it.\nGithub: config.json Telegram: https://t.me/genshinhelperupdates/5 Installation Assuming your config file is at /etc/genshin/config.json, use this command to map the volume:\n1 2 3 4 docker run -d --name=genshinhelper \\ -v /etc/genshin:/app/genshincheckinhelper/config \\ --restart always \\ yindan/genshinhelper:latest Configuration You can strip the config file down to only the parameters you need. If you only need the Cookie, it can look like this:\n1 2 3 { \u0026#34;COOKIE_MIHOYOBBS\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;COOKIE_MIHOYOBBS\u0026gt;\u0026#34; } Config Parameters RANDOM_SLEEP_SECS_RANGE: Random sleep range in seconds before check-in.

I just think she\u0026rsquo;s super cute (I didn\u0026rsquo;t even know it was Jia Ran at first). Yeah, this thing has quite a few bugs, and autostart doesn\u0026rsquo;t always trigger, but she\u0026rsquo;s just too adorable!\nThis extension also lets you change the background, but I\u0026rsquo;m not a big fan of that, so I skipped it.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s How It Looks Installation Open VS Code, then search for A-SOUL-live2d in Extensions and install it.\nExtension link: A-SOUL-live2d - Visual Studio Marketplace Honestly, you can just check the extension page for the installation process; no need to read my crappy article.\nBasic Usage Once installed, restart VS Code. Then, at the very bottom of the Explorer view, you\u0026rsquo;ll see LIVE2D-A-SOUL. Expand it (if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t expand, restart VS Code again).\nNext, in Supplementary Settings, click Generate plugin dependency files. Restart VS Code, then click Start live2d.\nJia Ran will pop up in the bottom right corner! You can hover your mouse over her, drag the third icon in the top right to move her position, and click the first icon to change her size.\nAfter adjusting her position and size, you can enable Autostart in Configuration Info, then click Save Current Configuration. Now, Jia Ran will appear every time you open VS Code~\nOther Features The following is copied from the plugin description:\nBasic Operations\nStart/Stop live2d: Self-explanatory. Starts the live2d character, defaulting to the bottom right. Save Current Configuration: After adjusting live2d size, scale, and drag position, you can save the settings. They\u0026rsquo;ll be loaded automatically next time. Reset Default Position: Use this if the current position is abnormal and cannot be dragged. [Scaling also resets] Background Image Click to Switch: The button is the second icon to the right of the character. Save Background Image: Only works if a background image is currently present. Only one can be saved; clicking again will overwrite the old one. Load Background Image: Loads the saved background image. Timed Switching: Self-explanatory. Check if the switch button is spinning to determine if the timed function is enabled. Background Image Style Configuration Download Background Image Configuration Info\nAutostart: Self-explanatory. When enabled, live2d will automatically start when VS Code launches. Positioning Dependency: The corner used for character positioning. Supplementary Settings\nPlugin Dependency Files: Plugin dependency files are automatically generated when the plugin is first installed and launched. Generate: If live2d fails to start normally, try clicking this button to force regeneration and overwrite existing configuration. Remove: Before uninstalling this plugin, please try to perform this operation first. It can remove all modifications the plugin made to VS Code files. Character Features\nGaze follows mouse [Drawback: Currently unable to follow across the entire page] Click Interaction A-SOUL Fan Navigation Website Entry Switch Background Image Switch Model Skating Rink Audio Test A-SOUL Fan-Created Content Website Entry Model Source Regarding Warnings Using it will pop up a Code corruption warning. The original author states:\nThis plugin runs by modifying VS Code\u0026rsquo;s JS files, so it will show the following prompt during first installation or VS Code upgrades. Please select [Don\u0026rsquo;t show again].\nAudio Support The current plugin only has a simple voice test; for now, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to consider this feature.\nVS Code\u0026rsquo;s Electron version does not include ffmpeg , so you need to replace the built-in ffmpeg dynamic link library for normal playback (you\u0026rsquo;ll need to replace it after every VS Code update).\nVS Code for Windows 1.31.0 - 1.35.1 didn\u0026rsquo;t require replacement; versions 1.36.0 and later don\u0026rsquo;t have this luxury.\nVS Code for macOS 1.43+ crashes after replacement Solution Uninstallation First, Remove from Supplementary Settings, then uninstall the plugin from the Extensions view.\n","date":"2022-06-01T06:01:00+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/45/","title":"Jia Ran in the Bottom Right Corner of VS Code"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by Gemini-3-flash Introduction I recently set up a personal page using GitHub Pages (it\u0026rsquo;s gone now), so here\u0026rsquo;s a quick guide on how to build a site and use a custom domain.\nThis post doesn\u0026rsquo;t cover complex site generators, since I basically just wrote a single Markdown file.\nCreate a GitHub Repository First, sign up for a GitHub account. Once logged in, create a new repository .\nThe Repository name should be username.github.io. For example, if my GitHub username is yexca, I would enter yexca.github.io.\nGit Environment Setup On Windows, just download and run the installer from the official Git website.\nAfter installation, open Git Bash and run the following commands:\n1 2 git config --global user.name \u0026#34;Your Name\u0026#34; git config --global user.email \u0026#34;email@example.com\u0026#34; Replace Your Name with your name and email@example.com with your email.\nFor example:\n1 2 git config --global user.name \u0026#34;yexca\u0026#34; git config --global user.email \u0026#34;yexca@duck.com\u0026#34; GitHub Desktop Installation If you\u0026rsquo;re already familiar with Git (though if you were, why are you reading this?), you can skip this step.\nGo to the GitHub Desktop website to download and install it.\nClone the Repository Open GitHub Desktop, log in, and clone the repository you just created to a local folder.\nThe app will show the repository interface with some quick actions on the right.\nI use VS Code, so I\u0026rsquo;ll click \u0026ldquo;Open in Visual Studio Code\u0026rdquo;.\nBuild the Site Create a README.md file and edit it using Markdown (shameless plug for my own Markdown notes).\nOnce edited and saved, go back to GitHub Desktop, click \u0026ldquo;Commit to main\u0026rdquo;, then click \u0026ldquo;Push origin\u0026rdquo;.\nNow, visit username.github.io to see your site. (If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t show up immediately, give it a few minutes).\nCustom Domain GitHub Pages Go to your repository settings, find \u0026ldquo;Pages\u0026rdquo; on the left, enter your custom domain under \u0026ldquo;Custom domain\u0026rdquo;, and click \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo;.\nNote: You can also choose a Jekyll theme here.\nDNS In your domain\u0026rsquo;s DNS settings, add a CNAME record pointing your domain to username.github.io, where username is your GitHub username.\nHTTPS For some reason, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get HTTPS working directly through GitHub, so I used Cloudflare .\nEnable the proxy in DNS settings, then under \u0026ldquo;SSL/TLS\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Edge Certificates\u0026rdquo;, toggle on \u0026ldquo;Always Use HTTPS\u0026rdquo;.\nOther Site Builders Since I didn\u0026rsquo;t need a full blog, I just used a simple file. If you want a real blog, check out these tools:\nJekyll : Officially supported by GitHub. VuePress : Great for Markdown-centric sites. Gitbook: Good for documentation sites.

This thing is super useful, so I\u0026rsquo;m writing up some learning notes.\nYou can learn on the go with an online editor , or download a desktop editor .\nMy preferred Markdown editor is Typora .\nFor a quick refresh, check out the official Markdown Syntax Cheat Sheet .\nHeadings To create a heading, just use # + space + heading text. There are six levels, mapping to HTML\u0026rsquo;s h1-h6.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 # This is a H1 ## This is a H2 ### This is a H3 #### This is a H4 ##### This is a H5 ###### This is a H6 For general web writing, the H1 is usually the page title, H2s start the main content, and you\u0026rsquo;ll probably use up to H4.\nLine Breaks Just add two or more spaces at the end of a line, then hit Enter. Some editors might add a line break directly.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 这是第一行 //这里有俩空格，后面也有→ 这是第二行 Result:\nThis is the first line // two spaces here, and more after →\nThis is the second line\nItalics \u0026amp; Bold For italics, wrap text with a single *. For bold, use two **.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 3 *This is italics* **This is bold** ***This is italic and bold*** Result:\nThis is italics\nThis is bold\nThis is italic and bold\nBlockquotes To create a blockquote, just add \u0026gt; + space + content at the start of a paragraph.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 3 \u0026gt; This is a level 1 blockquote \u0026gt;\u0026gt; This is a level 2 blockquote \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; This is a level 3 blockquote Result:\nThis is a level 1 blockquote\nThis is a level 2 blockquote\nThis is a level 3 blockquote\nLists You can create ordered and unordered lists.\nOrdered Lists Just add number + . + space + content before each list item.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 3 1. First item 2. Second item 3. Third item Result:\nFirst item Second item Third item Unordered Lists Use +, -, or * + space + content. But don\u0026rsquo;t mix them (for compatibility).\nSub-items can be indented with four spaces or a TAB, then formatted like the parent item.\nHowever, to comply with markdownlint standards, try to use the same symbol for all unordered lists in an article, like always using -.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 - First item - First item sub-item one - First item sub-item two - First item sub-item two sub-item one - Second item - Third item Result:\nFirst item First item sub-item one First item sub-item two First item sub-item two sub-item one Second item Third item Code Inline Code Wrap content you want to turn into inline code with backticks ( ). If your code contains a backtick, use double backticks ( ).\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 `Turn this content into a code block` ``This content contains a \u0026#39;`\u0026#39; oh~`` Result:\nTurn this content into a code block\nThis content contains a '`' oh~\nCode Blocks You can indent each line with four spaces or a TAB.\nAlternatively, wrap the code with triple backticks (```) on the lines above and below. For syntax highlighting, specify the language after the opening triple backticks.\nTo follow best practices, use the triple backtick method.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` C include\u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; int main(void) { printf(\u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34;); } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Result: ``` C include\u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; int main(void) { printf(\u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34;); } Horizontal Rules On a separate line, use three or more *, -, or _.\nFor consistency, it\u0026rsquo;s best to use three asterisks.\nFor example, this code:\n1 *** Result:\nLinks Simple Links Just wrap the URL or email address with \u0026lt;\u0026gt;.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 \u0026lt;https://yexca.net\u0026gt; \u0026lt;yexca@duck.com\u0026gt; Result:\nhttps://yexca.net yexca@duck.com Links with Custom Text [Link text](URL \u0026quot;Optional Title\u0026quot;). The \u0026quot;Optional Title\u0026quot; part can be omitted.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 [yexca\u0026#39;s Blog](https://blog.yexca.net) [yexca\u0026#39;s Blog](https://blog.yexca.net \u0026#34;Actually, it\u0026#39;s yexca and Hiyoung\u0026#39;s blog\u0026#34;) Result:\nyexca\u0026rsquo;s Blog yexca\u0026rsquo;s Blog Reference-Style Links For example, this code:\n1 2 3 4 [blog]: https://blog.yexca.net [contact]: \u0026lt;mailto:yexca@duck.com\u0026gt; This is my [personal blog][blog]. If you have questions, you can [contact me][contact]. Result:\nThis is my personal blog . If you have questions, you can contact me .\nImages Embedding Images ![Alt text](Image URL \u0026quot;Optional Title\u0026quot;). Alt text shows if the image fails to load, and Optional Title appears on hover.\nNote: Some Markdown editors don\u0026rsquo;t support Optional Title (like this site\u0026rsquo;s theme). For best practice, at least ensure Alt text is provided.\nFor example, this code:\n1 ![Image](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/yexca/picx-images-hosting@master/2023/04-网站背景/blog-background.2p10z489pjc0.webp \u0026#34;This is the background of this site\u0026#34;) Result:\nImage with a Link Use the link syntax, but put the image syntax inside the [].\nFor example, this code:\n1 [![Image](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/yexca/picx-images-hosting@master/2023/04-网站背景/blog-background.2p10z489pjc0.webp)](https://www.pixiv.net/artworks/82542737) Result:\nEscaping Characters If you have characters you don\u0026rsquo;t want Markdown to format, just add a \\ before them.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 I want to type *but this will be italic* Adding an escape character \\* will prevent italics and display the character Result:\nI want to type but this will be italic\nAdding an escape character * will prevent italics and display the character\nEmbedded HTML You can use HTML directly. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example with the \u0026lt;details\u0026gt; tag.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \u0026lt;details\u0026gt; \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; Click me \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; Found you! \u0026lt;/details\u0026gt; I can use Markdown **for bold**, and also HTML \u0026lt;i\u0026gt;for italics\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt; at the same time. Since this site\u0026rsquo;s theme doesn\u0026rsquo;t directly parse HTML5, I won\u0026rsquo;t demonstrate it live.\nTables Use three or more - for column headers, | to separate columns, and : for left, right, or center alignment (optional).\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 3 |Title|Content|Notes| |:---|:---:|---:| |Left-aligned|Centered|Right-aligned| Result:\nTitle Content Notes Left-aligned Centered Right-aligned Note: You cannot add headings, blockquotes, lists, images, or HTML tags inside tables.\nStrikethrough Add ~~ before and after the text you want to strike through.\nFor example, this code:\n1 I will always love ~~Dr. War Literature~~ Warma Result:\nI will always love Dr. War Literature Warma\nTask Lists Use - + space + [ ] or [x] + space + content.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 - [ ] This isn\u0026#39;t done yet - [x] This one is finished Result:\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t done yet This one is finished Using Emojis Copy and Paste In most cases, you can directly copy emojis from Emojipedia and paste them. Just ensure your web encoding is UTF-8.\nUsing Emoji Shortcodes This requires Markdown application support, using colons : at the beginning and end.\nYou can look up shortcodes via the Emoji Shortcode List .\nFor example, this code:\n1 :blush:,:smiley: Result:\n😊,😃\nFootnotes Similar to citations or superscripts in academic papers.\nFor example, this code:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 This references Wikipedia[^1], and this references Github[^2]. You can also use English, but no spaces or TABs[^yexca]. [^1]: You can use text here, which will appear at the corresponding position above. [^2]: Or use a link [Github](https://github.com/yexca) [^yexca]: [Personal Homepage](https://lit.link/yexca) Result: The references appear at the very end of the article.

When using the mv command, make sure the destination directory exists, or it will simply rename the file. Creating a hard link is essentially giving a file an additional name (the data itself remains unchanged). It\u0026rsquo;s similar to creating a pointer to that file in C. Symbolic links are like shortcuts in Windows. You can clearly see the difference using the ls -li command. Hard links have the same byte count as the source file, while symbolic links do not. Creating commands with alias: Use ; to run multiple commands on the same line. Use type to check if a command already exists in the system. Note that aliases created this way disappear when the shell session ends (since they aren\u0026rsquo;t saved to a file). Use unalias to remove an alias. Using \u0026gt; redirects and overwrites the target file, while \u0026gt;\u0026gt; appends to it. To write error messages to a file instead of displaying them on the screen, use 2\u0026gt;. There are two ways to redirect both standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) to the same file: first, add 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 after the filename; second, use \u0026amp;\u0026gt; as the redirection operator.

Since Koikatu is my favorite, I decided to give it a try. However, I encountered several issues, so I’m documenting them here. Note: the VR version has no story mode, and I used the vanilla version of the game, so there were fewer problems overall.\nPrerequisites / Conditions Some of the following images and text are from the official Oculus Support page . I translated some parts myself, but since my English isn\u0026rsquo;t great, please refer to the official content for accuracy. For full details, see Oculus Link compatibility requirements .\nCable Requirements Oculus Link requires a high-quality USB cable that supports both data and power. For comfort and usability, the cable should be at least 3 meters (10 feet) long.\nPC Requirements Component Recommended Specs CPU Intel i5-4590 / AMD Ryzen 5 1500X or better GPU See table below RAM 8 GB or more OS Windows 10 USB Port At least one USB port Supported GPUs for Oculus Link NVIDIA GPUs Supported Not Supported NVIDIA Titan Z X NVIDIA Titan X X NVIDIA GTX 970 X GTX 1060 (Desktop, 3GB) X GTX 1060 (Desktop, 6GB) X GTX 1060M X GTX 1070 (all) X GTX 1080 (all) X GTX 1650 X GTX 1650 Super X GTX 1660 X GTX 1660 Ti X RTX 20-series (all) X RTX 30-series (all) X AMD GPUs Supported Not Supported AMD 200 Series X AMD 300 Series X AMD 400 Series X AMD 500 Series X AMD 5000 Series X AMD 6000 Series X AMD Vega Series X 1. Launching the Game To launch the VR version, simply open KoikatuVR.exe. Since this uses Steam streaming, you should start SteamVR beforehand.\nBefore playing, make sure to wear your headphones and lock your door to avoid\u0026hellip; unexpected situations. If you can’t, then just play responsibly (doge).\nProblem 1: Can’t Enter SteamVR Step 1: Ensure All Required Software Is Installed 1) Install SteamVR Open Steam, press Win+R, enter steam://run/250820, and hit enter. This will trigger the installation of SteamVR.\n2) Install Oculus Software Go to the Oculus setup page . After installation, additional files will be downloaded, and you’ll be prompted to log in. Make sure your network is working properly.\nIf asked for a payment method, look for a “Skip” button.\nStuck on Loading at Login? You can fix this by modifying your hosts file. I recommend using Huorong (a Chinese antivirus tool) to edit it safely.\nIf you don’t use Huorong, go to C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc, find the file named hosts, and open it with Notepad.\nAdd the following lines at the end:\n1 2 3 4 5 157.240.11.49 graph.oculus.com 157.240.11.49 www2.oculus.com 157.240.8.49 scontent.oculuscdn.com 157.240.8.49 securecdn.oculus.com Save the file. If you\u0026rsquo;re not using Huorong, save it elsewhere first and move it back, removing any .txt extension.\nStep 2: Check the Link Cable The Oculus app will prompt you to test the Link cable during setup. If you skipped it, go to Devices \u0026gt; Quest2 and Touch - USB Test to test again.\nStep 3: Check Settings 1) Quest2 Device Settings When you connect your Quest2 via USB, it will ask if you want to allow data access. Select “Deny.” If you allowed it by mistake, unplug and reconnect, then choose “Deny.”\n2) Oculus Software Settings SteamVR will prompt you to allow “unknown sources.” Click “Allow.”\nAlternatively, go to Settings \u0026gt; General \u0026gt; Unknown Sources in the Oculus software.\nStep 4: Still Not Working? Try This Sequence 1) Quest2 Device After connecting to your PC, you should see a popup asking to “Enable Oculus Link.” Click “Enable.”\nIf no popup appears, go to the Quick Settings panel on the bottom left and click “Oculus Link.”\n2) Start SteamVR Surely you know how to launch SteamVR\u0026hellip; right? (doge)\nIf your VR device is connected before starting Steam, the top-right corner of Steam should show a “VR” button. Click it to start.\nIf not, right-click the Steam icon in your system tray and select the second-last option — that’s SteamVR.\nOr enable the \u0026ldquo;Tools\u0026rdquo; view in your Steam library to find SteamVR listed there.\n2. Starting the Game I don’t really know what to write here — this section exists just to make Problem 2 game-related (doge).\nLaunching KoikatuVR.exe will auto-start SteamVR. So you can open KoikatuVR after launching Oculus Link on your Quest2.\nNote: The game also opens a window on your desktop. You can press Win+D to minimize all windows. But when you take off and put your headset back on, the window may reappear. Just a heads-up.\nProblem 2: Can’t Start the Game / Don’t Know How You might’ve read elsewhere or seen videos saying only certain devices are supported (I forgot which).\nIf you also tested “VR Kanojo” and assumed it uses eye tracking to select — that’s incorrect (I thought so too lol).\nJust press the joystick to bring up a selection line, then use the front trigger to confirm.\n(See 3. Controls for more input info.)\nProblem 3: White Screen After Starting / Stuck on Loading Go to the Koikatu DL page and scroll down to download the コイカツ VR パッチ.\nDirect link: VR Patch Download Unzip the file and run the executable. It’ll create a コイカツ！VR_0531 folder. Copy the contents of the setup folder into your game directory and overwrite when prompted.\nNote: According to the original author, this patch may limit positions to only three. I didn’t verify it myself since I didn’t play far. I initially wanted to play the story in VR, but that’s not supported. Here’s their (edited) fix:\nYou need to use the positions in Story Mode first, then they become available in VR. So just go through all positions during battles, then save at night, exit, switch to VR, and they’ll be available.\nSource (Chinese): Anyone Tried the VR Version? 3. Controls These are based on personal gameplay and only cover the basics. For full controls, consult other guides.\n1) Starting the Game You’ll see two options after launch:\nスタート = Start エンド = End Press the joystick to show a selection line, and confirm with the front trigger.\n2) In-Game Interface Text will appear near your wrist. Use the Y and B buttons to switch tabs.\nThere are two tabs normally and a third (Move) during combat:\nJapanese English Description Function アクション Action Actions Front trigger to act, side trigger for menu, joystick to select システム System System Settings Front trigger to reset position 移動 Move Movement Hold front trigger to rotate view 3) Notes You can only use the joystick to select options while on the “アクション” (Action) tab.\nReferences Oculus Link Official Anyone Tried the VR Version?

The networks we typically use (including the internet) operate based on the TCP/IP suite, and HTTP is a subset of it. For devices on the internet to communicate, they must follow common rules, which we call protocols. (TCP/IP is a general term for various internet-related protocol families, including but not limited to: PPPoE, HTTP, TCP, IP, UDP, IEEE 802.3, etc.)\nThe TCP/IP protocol suite is structured in layers, from top to bottom: Application Layer, Transport Layer, Network Layer, Data Link Layer.\nInternet protocol suite - Wikipedia When communicating using the TCP/IP protocol suite, the client moves down from the Application Layer, and the server moves up from the Data Link Layer. As the client transmits data between layers, each layer adds its header information. Conversely, the server removes headers layer by layer. This method of wrapping data is called encapsulation.\n1.2 IP, TCP, and DNS 1.2.1 IP Protocol The IP protocol operates at the Network Layer. The \u0026ldquo;IP\u0026rdquo; in TCP/IP refers to the IP protocol itself, not an IP address. The IP protocol\u0026rsquo;s job is to send various data packets to their destination. Different IP addresses can be paired with MAC addresses. While IP addresses can change, MAC addresses generally do not. An IP address specifies the address assigned to a node, while a MAC address is the fixed address belonging to a network interface card (NIC).\n1.2.2 MAC Address Communication between IPs relies on MAC addresses. Typically, the ARP protocol is used to find the corresponding MAC address for a given IP address.\n1.2.3 TCP Protocol Layer-wise, TCP is in the Transport Layer, providing a Byte Stream Service. This means it manages large chunks of data by splitting them into smaller segments for easier transmission. In short, TCP segments data to make large transfers simpler and can also confirm if data successfully reached the other party.\nTo confirm data delivery, TCP uses a three-way handshake. This handshake uses TCP flags: SYN (synchronize) and ACK (acknowledgement).\n1.2.4 DNS Service for Domain Name Resolution Computers can be assigned both IP addresses and hostnames/domain names. The DNS protocol provides services to look up IP addresses from domain names, or vice-versa, to find domain names from IP addresses.\n1.3 URL and URI 1.3.1 Differences and Relationship Compared to URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), we\u0026rsquo;re more familiar with URL (Uniform Resource Locator). URLs are what you type into a web browser to access web pages, like https://www.bilibili.com/ . A URI identifies a resource on the internet using a string, while a URL indicates the resource\u0026rsquo;s location (its address on the internet). So, a URL is a subset of a URI. A URI can be a locator (URL), a name (URN), or both. A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is like a person\u0026rsquo;s name, while a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is like their address. In other words, a URN defines what something is, and a URL provides how to find it.\n1.3.2 URI Format To represent a specific URI, you can use an absolute URI, absolute URL, or relative URL, all of which contain the necessary information.\nA relative URL is specified from the browser\u0026rsquo;s base URI, for example, /image/logo.gif.\nAbsolute URI format:\nLogin Info (Authentication): Specifies a username and password for authentication when retrieving resources from the server. This is optional.\nServer Address: When using an absolute URI, you must specify the server address to access. This can be a DNS-resolvable name like hackr.jp, an IPv4 address like 192.168.1.1, or an IPv6 address enclosed in square brackets, such as [0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1].\nServer Port Number: Specifies the network port number for connecting to the server. This is also optional; if omitted, the default port is used automatically.\nHierarchical File Path: Specifies the file path on the server to locate the specific resource. This is similar to the directory structure in UNIX systems.\nQuery String: For resources within the specified file path, you can pass arbitrary parameters using a query string. This is optional.\nFragment Identifier: A fragment identifier typically marks a sub-resource within the retrieved resource (a specific location within a document). However, its usage is not explicitly defined in RFCs . This is also optional.\nChapter 2: The Simple HTTP Protocol 2.1 HTTP Introduction HTTP is a stateless protocol. This means the HTTP protocol itself doesn\u0026rsquo;t save the communication state between each request and response. So, cookie technology was introduced to maintain state. (Note: This HTTP book was published earlier. Current state management technologies are achieved through a combination of cookies, sessions, and tokens .)\n2.2 Common HTTP Methods GET: Retrieve resources\nThe GET method is used to request the resource specified by the URL. The server processes the specified resource and returns the response content.\nPOST: Transmit entity body\nPOST is used to send data to the server. It\u0026rsquo;s also employed when the data to be transmitted (e.g., in a request body) is too large.\nDifferences between GET and POST:\nLet\u0026rsquo;s cut to the chase: there\u0026rsquo;s no fundamental difference between GET and POST methods; it\u0026rsquo;s mostly about message format.\nRequest Parameter Length Limit: GET requests are typically limited to ~1024KB (browser/server dependent), while POST has no inherent limit on request data. Request Parameters: GET request parameters are passed via the URL, with multiple parameters joined by \u0026lsquo;\u0026amp;\u0026rsquo;. POST request parameters are placed in the request body. Request Caching: GET requests can be cached, while POST requests are not, unless manually configured. Security: POST is considered more secure than GET. GET requests are harmless on browser back, but POST may re-submit the request. History: GET request parameters are fully retained in browser history, while POST parameters are not. Encoding: GET requests only support URL encoding, while POST supports various encoding types. Parameter Data Types: GET typically only accepts ASCII characters (after URL encoding), while POST has no such restriction.\nAdditionally, HTTP includes other methods like PUT, HEAD, and DELETE , which we won\u0026rsquo;t detail here.\n2.3 HTTP Persistent Connections (Three-way Handshake, Four-way Wave) The characteristic of persistent connections is that the TCP connection remains active as long as neither end explicitly requests to close it.\nThree-way handshake: Establishes TCP connection. Four-way wave: Terminates TCP connection.\nWith persistent connections, pipelining allows sending the next request without waiting for the previous response.\n2.4 State Management with Cookies Cookies instruct the client to save a Cookie based on the \u0026lsquo;Set-Cookie\u0026rsquo; header field information sent in the server\u0026rsquo;s response. The next time the client sends a request to that server, it automatically includes the Cookie value in the request message.\nCookie information is generated by the server and sent to the client for storage.\nChapter 3: HTTP Message Information 3.1 HTTP Request and Response Message Structure Information exchanged using the HTTP protocol is called an HTTP message. HTTP messages from the requesting party (client) are called request messages, and those from the responding party (server) are called response messages. They consist of an 8-bit byte stream and are transmitted via HTTP communication.\nRequest Line: Contains the request method, request URI, and HTTP version.\nStatus Line: Contains the status code indicating the response result, a reason phrase, and the HTTP version.\nHeader Fields: Contain various headers representing conditions and attributes of the request and response. Generally, there are four types of headers: General Headers, Request Headers, Response Headers, and Entity Headers.\nOther: May include headers not defined in HTTP RFCs (e.g., Cookie).\n3.2 Encoded and Chunked Transfer HTTP uses encoding during data transmission to improve transfer speed.\n3.2.1 Differences Between Message Body and Entity Body Entity: Transmitted as payload data (supplementary item) in a request or response, its content consists of an entity header and an entity body.\nThe HTTP message body is used to transmit the request or response entity body. Typically, the message body equals the entity body. A difference between them only arises when encoding operations modify the entity body\u0026rsquo;s content during transmission.\n3.2.2 Chunking Entity Bodies for Transfer When transferring large amounts of data in HTTP communication, splitting the data into multiple chunks allows browsers to display pages progressively. This feature of chunking the entity body is called chunked transfer encoding. Chunked transfer encoding divides the entity body into multiple chunks. Each chunk is marked with its size in hexadecimal, and the last chunk of the entity body is marked with \u0026ldquo;0(CR+LF)\u0026rdquo;.\nThese \u0026ldquo;chunks\u0026rdquo; are also commonly referred to as \u0026ldquo;packets\u0026rdquo;.\nChapter 4: HTTP Status Codes for Return Results 4.1 Status Code Categories Status codes let users know if the server processed the request successfully. There are many types, but only about 14 are commonly used.\n4.2 2XX Success 4.2.1 200 OK Indicates that the client\u0026rsquo;s request was successfully processed by the server. The information returned with the status code in the response message varies depending on the method used.\n4.2.2 204 No Content This status code means the server successfully processed the request, but the returned response message contains no entity body.\n4.3 3XX Redirection We\u0026rsquo;ll focus on 301 and 302 redirects. Other status codes can be looked up independently.\n4.3.1 301 Moved Permanently A 301 redirect is a permanent redirection. This status code indicates that the requested resource has been assigned a new URI, and future requests should use the URI now pointing to that resource. For example, if you forget to add a trailing slash \u0026ldquo;/\u0026rdquo; to a resource path like the one below, a 301 status code might be generated.\nhttp://excample.com/sample\n4.3.2 302 Found A 302 redirect is a temporary redirection. This status code indicates that the requested resource has been assigned a new URI, and the client (for this time) is expected to access it using the new URI. Similar to 301 Moved Permanently, but 302 signifies a temporary move, not a permanent one.\n4.4 4XX Client Errors These include 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, and 404 Not Found. We\u0026rsquo;ll focus on 404 Not Found.\n4.4.1 404 Not Found This status code indicates that the requested resource could not be found on the server. It can also be used by the server to deny a request without specifying a reason.\n4.5 5XX Server Errors 5XX responses indicate an error occurred on the server itself.\nChapter 5: Web Servers 5.1 Communication Data Forwarding: Proxies, Gateways, Tunnels 5.1.1 Proxy A proxy server\u0026rsquo;s basic function is to receive a client\u0026rsquo;s request and forward it to another server. Proxies don\u0026rsquo;t alter the request URI; they send it directly to the upstream target server holding the resource. It\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that \u0026ldquo;proxy\u0026rdquo; usually refers to a client-side proxy (also called a forward proxy), while a reverse proxy acts on behalf of the server.\nUsing a proxy server can reduce network bandwidth by leveraging caching, and sometimes proxies are used for information security.\nCaching Proxy When forwarding responses, a Caching Proxy saves a copy (cache) of the resource on the proxy server beforehand. When the proxy receives another request for the same resource, it can return the cached resource as a response instead of fetching it from the origin server.\nReverse Proxy Reverse proxies offer many benefits:\nHides the IP address of the server (cluster) from clients. Security: Acts as an application layer firewall , providing protection against web-based attacks (e.g., DoS / DDoS ) and making it easier to identify malware , etc. Uniformly provides encryption and SSL acceleration for backend servers (clusters) (e.g., SSL termination proxy). Load balancing : If a server in the cluster is heavily loaded, the reverse proxy uses URL rewriting to retrieve the requested resource from a less-loaded server or a backup. Provides caching services for static content and dynamic content with high access requests in a short period. Performs compression on some content to save bandwidth or provide service to networks with poor bandwidth.\n5.1.2 Gateway Gateways operate very similarly to proxies. However, a gateway enables servers on the communication path to provide services using non-HTTP protocols.\n","date":"2022-03-16T23:56:48+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/29/","title":"Summary and Discussion After Reading 'Illustrated HTTP'"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by Gemini-3-flash Note This article is mirrored from 《unity学习笔记》——将MMD模型导入unity for personal reference.

However, most free image hosts suffer from disappearing images or slow speeds, so I started looking into self-hosted solutions.\nRenting a dedicated cloud server just for images is too expensive, and most paid image hosts have traffic or storage limits.

(Later found out this router has too little space to install many plugins, so it was a wasted afternoon.)\nUpdate 2022.02.17: Accidentally found an FIR300M firmware with a built-in gateway. However, it uses a very old method for flashing. Please be careful when identifying it if you plan to flash it.\nOriginal Post: Update Compilation Method - FIR300M/FIR302M Openwrt Firmware No Disassembly Flash Baidu Netdisk: Password: vouv What is OpenWRT? OpenWRT is a Linux-based system for routers.

Brief Steps Log in to the router\u0026rsquo;s admin panel (192.168.1.1). Visit http://192.168.1.1/goform/Diagnosis?pingAddr=192.168.1.100|echo\u0026quot;\u0026quot;|telnetd Open Command Prompt (cmd) and type: telnet 192.168.1.1 Transfer the firmware to the router and wait for it to complete. Accessing the router\u0026rsquo;s admin panel now will show OpenWRT (no password initially, just log in). Go to System - Language and Style to change the language to Chinese. Detailed Steps (Step 4) Open HFS, rename the firmware from \u0026ldquo;Preparation\u0026rdquo; step 2 to \u0026ldquo;1.bin\u0026rdquo;, and drag it into the window.\nAfter connecting via telnet 192.168.1.1 in cmd, enter the following commands sequentially:\n1 2 3 cd /tmp wget http://192.168.1.100/1.bin // Replace \u0026#34;192.168.1.100\u0026#34; with your PC\u0026#39;s IP mtd_write -r write 1.bin Kernel // Note: K is capitalized After successful execution, the router will automatically reboot, and you\u0026rsquo;ll see \u0026ldquo;Connection Lost\u0026rdquo;.\nInstalling Plugins In the OpenWRT admin panel, click \u0026ldquo;System - Software\u0026rdquo; to install the desired plugins.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s recommended to search GitHub for plugins or write your own. You can directly copy the .ipk file link from the Release section of the corresponding project on GitHub.\nHow to install your own written plugins? If you can write them, you can figure this out, right? (doge)\nNotes Plugin installation requires compatibility with your router. Some plugins might need environment dependencies, meaning other plugins need to be installed first.\nYou can usually figure this out from the error messages.\nReferences FIR300M No Disassembly Flash Openwrt Tutorial Router Firmware Flashing - Phicomm Router FIR300M Flash OpenWrt Firmware Tutorial HFS – A Great Local File Sharing Tool, Quickly Transfer Files from PC to Mobile Devices, etc. Xu Yingguo Episode 215: Installing and Uninstalling OpenWrt Plugins ","date":"2022-02-06T20:44:10+08:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/22/","title":"Flashing OpenWRT Firmware on FIR300M Router"},{"content":" 📢 This article was translated by gemini-3-flash-preview Introduction (The Fluff) Sometimes you need to insert code into a Word document.

Programs on Linux systems always read the system\u0026rsquo;s Kernel time. Every time Linux boots, the Kernel first reads the hardware clock settings (though the hardware time might not be accurate then). After that, the system clock runs independently of the hardware clock. So, to permanently change Linux time and keep it accurate, you need to permanently update the hardware clock. Otherwise, upon reboot, the system time will revert to the old hardware time. Linux Clock Commands For the system (Kernel) clock, use timedatectl or date. For the hardware (BIOS) clock, use hwclock or clock.\n1. Check current Linux system time by typing date in the Linux CLI 1 data Check hardware time with hwclock --show\n1 hwclock --show 2. Calibrate Linux System Time (requires network for NTP service) Here\u0026rsquo;s how to install and configure NTP on CentOS: 1 2 # Install the NTP service package sudo yum install ntp 1 2 # Set NTP service to start on boot sudo chkconfig ntp on 1 2 # Modify startup parameters: add -g -x to allow NTP to function even with large system time discrepancies. sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/ntpd 1 2 # Start the NTP service sudo service ntpd restart Here\u0026rsquo;s how to install and configure NTP on Ubuntu/Debian: 1 2 # Install the NTP service package sudo apt-get install ntp 1 2 # Modify startup parameters: add -g -x to allow NTP to function even with large system time discrepancies. sudo vi /etc/default/ntp 1 2 # Start the NTP service sudo service ntp restart Sync hardware clock with system clock 1 hwclock --systohc --localtime (This one seems more effective) Or\n1 timedatectl set-local-rtc 1 Finally, write date to CMOS for permanent effect 1 clock -w Or\n1 hwclock -w 3.

Note: In older C versions, malloc and calloc returned char * pointers; ANSI C defines them as void *.\nImplementing a Dynamic Linked List 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 #include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt;

To sort records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.\nSQL ORDER BY Syntax 1 2 3 SELECT column_name, column_name FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name1, column_name2 ASC|DESC; – ASC stands for ascending, DESC stands for descending.\n– The ORDER BY clause should be placed at the end of the script. When sorting multiple columns, the database sorts by column_name1 first, then column_name2, and so on.\n2. Deleting All Data (DELETE and DROP TABLE) You can delete all rows in a table without deleting the table itself. This keeps the table structure, attributes, and indexes intact: DELETE FROM table_name;\nOr:\nDELETE * FROM table_name;\nNote: Be extremely careful when deleting records! You can\u0026rsquo;t undo this action.\nDROP TABLE Statement The DROP TABLE statement is used to delete a table entirely: DROP TABLE table_name\nNote: Unlike DELETE, DROP TABLE removes both the table data and the structure. This is also irreversible.\nDROP DATABASE Statement The DROP DATABASE statement is used to delete a database: DROP DATABASE database_name\nTRUNCATE TABLE Statement If you only need to wipe the data inside a table but keep the table itself, use the TRUNCATE TABLE statement: TRUNCATE TABLE table_name\n3. SQL JOIN SQL JOINs are used to combine rows from two or more tables.\nThe image below illustrates 7 common usages related to LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, INNER JOIN, and OUTER JOIN.\nINNER JOIN: Returns rows if there is at least one match in both tables (INNER JOIN is the same as JOIN). LEFT JOIN: Returns all rows from the left table, even if there are no matches in the right table. RIGHT JOIN: Returns all rows from the right table, even if there are no matches in the left table. FULL JOIN: Returns rows if there is a match in either of the tables. Note: Join statements in SQL correspond to the connection concepts in database theory. LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and INNER JOIN correspond to natural joins, while FULL JOIN corresponds to a Cartesian product.\n4. SQL Constraints 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 CREATE TABLE table_name ( column_name1 data_type(size) constraint_name, column_name2 data_type(size) constraint_name, column_name3 data_type(size) constraint_name, .... ); NOT NULL – Ensures a column cannot store NULL values. UNIQUE – Ensures every row in a column has a unique value. (A table can have multiple UNIQUE constraints but only one PRIMARY KEY; PRIMARY KEY automatically includes a UNIQUE constraint). PRIMARY KEY – A combination of NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each record in a table. Helps in finding specific records faster. FOREIGN KEY – Ensures referential integrity by matching data in one table to values in another. CHECK – Ensures the values in a column meet specific conditions. DEFAULT – Sets a default value for a column when no value is specified. 5. AUTO INCREMENT Field Usually, we want the primary key value to be created automatically every time a new record is inserted.\nIn SQL Server, we use the IDENTITY field to achieve this.\nThe following SQL defines the \u0026ldquo;ID\u0026rdquo; column in the \u0026ldquo;Persons\u0026rdquo; table as an auto-increment primary key:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 CREATE TABLE Persons ( ID int IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY, LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL, FirstName varchar(255), Address varchar(255), City varchar(255) ) In this example, the starting value for IDENTITY is 1, and it increments by 1 for each new record.\nTip: To start the \u0026ldquo;ID\u0026rdquo; column at 10 and increment by 5, change it to IDENTITY(10,5).\nWhen inserting into the \u0026ldquo;Persons\u0026rdquo; table, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to specify a value for the \u0026ldquo;ID\u0026rdquo; column (it\u0026rsquo;s added automatically):\n1 2 INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName,LastName) VALUES (\u0026#39;Lars\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Monsen\u0026#39;) The SQL above inserts a new record where \u0026ldquo;ID\u0026rdquo; gets a unique auto-generated value, \u0026ldquo;FirstName\u0026rdquo; is \u0026ldquo;Lars\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;LastName\u0026rdquo; is \u0026ldquo;Monsen\u0026rdquo;.\n6.

It doesn\u0026rsquo;t include a compiler or many other features, so you need to install the compiler yourself.\nStep 1: Download the software from the VS Code official website: Visual Studio Code – Code Editing. Redefined Step 2: We need to download a compiler. For C, we use GCC. Link: MinGW-w64 – for 32 and 64 bit Windows download | SourceForge.net . Select x86_64-posix-seh from the latest version. The website download might be slow, so here is a Baidu Netdisk link provided below.\n(Baidu Netdisk \u0026ldquo;Rapid Transfer\u0026rdquo; link: b48357234368d9ba439fc0db6e86531d#84cbf1dc60abe4fff77d035540ea3132#140697937#mingw64.zip)\n(Standard Baidu Netdisk link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/17FYT\\_Y-s-I2yajFc2MICqw Code: ewis )\nStep 3: Add E:\\mingw64\\bin to your system environment variables (adjust the drive letter based on your actual installation path).\nFor Win11: Open Settings -\u0026gt; System -\u0026gt; About -\u0026gt; Advanced system settings -\u0026gt; Environment Variables -\u0026gt; System variables -\u0026gt; Click Path -\u0026gt; Edit -\u0026gt; Browse -\u0026gt; Add the corresponding folder.\nStep 4:\nPress Win+R, run cmd (don\u0026rsquo;t skip this step). Type gcc. It should return no input files rather than \u0026ldquo;\u0026lsquo;gcc\u0026rsquo; is not recognized as an internal or external command\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;The term \u0026lsquo;gcc\u0026rsquo; is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.\u0026rdquo; If you see the latter, your GCC folder isn\u0026rsquo;t in the Path environment variable. If you added it and it still fails, restart your PC. If it still doesn\u0026rsquo;t work after a restart, you likely missed a step.\nType gcc -v to see the version. If the version displayed is different or older than the one you just downloaded, it means there\u0026rsquo;s an older compiler already in your Path (possibly from another IDE). You\u0026rsquo;ll need to remove the old GCC path from your Path variable.\nThese validations must pass; otherwise, you have to fix your environment variables. Just be careful not to delete important system entries.\nStep 5: Open VS Code and download the relevant extensions.\nStep 6: We need to create two JSON files: launch.json and tasks.json (the filenames must be exactly these). Read the code comments carefully; there are several places in both files where you must change the path to your compiler\u0026rsquo;s actual path.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 { // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes. // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes. // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387 \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0.2.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;configurations\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;gcc.exe - Build and debug active file\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;cppdbg\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;request\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;launch\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;program\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;${fileDirname}\\\\bin\\\\${fileBasenameNoExtension}.exe\u0026#34;,// This means the generated binary will be placed in a \u0026#39;bin\u0026#39; folder within the current directory.
