Some swipe cards like designers, and design systems like they live life.\n1. Introduction: What is a Card Enthusiast? Let’s start with something I once saw online—the seven favorite hobbies of card enthusiasts:\nNote: “Mainland China” here refers to regions where capital inflow and outflow are restricted.\nFinding ways to spend foreign currency in China Finding ways to spend RMB abroad Finding ways to move RMB out of the country Finding ways to bring foreign currency in Applying for cards that are useless in China Applying for cards that are even more useless abroad Trying to move around money that doesn’t even reach the length of a typical PIN code, across a bunch of nearly useless cards Note: In mainland China, bank PINs are usually 6 digits. This is a self-deprecating joke meaning “my balance doesn’t even reach 6 digits, but I’m still shuffling it like it matters.” May not apply elsewhere.\nIt may sound like a financial game—applying for cards, chasing cashback, reducing fees, optimizing exchanges\u0026hellip; Seems like a bunch of petty tricks.\nBut for true card enthusiasts:\nIt’s not about saving a few bucks—it\u0026rsquo;s about designing an optimal, multi-channel, multi-constraint capital flow system.\nThey’re not milking the system. They’re exploring the architecture of reality, optimizing the structure of everyday life.\n2. What Does a System Architect Actually Do? To become a certified system architect, you need to learn all kinds of jargon—modular decoupling, performance optimization, API specification, and more. But beyond the terms, the real job is simple:\nFaced with complex constraints, allocate resources, design routes, and connect systems to build something stable yet flexible.\nA system architect isn’t just writing beautiful code or drawing diagrams. Their main concern is: will the system work in real-world chaos? For example:\nHow should modules divide responsibilities? How should services interact? How can interfaces be defined for future expansion? How do we locate issues and isolate failures? How do we balance performance and cost under limited resources? Their role is part LEGO builder, part road engineer, part system patcher. Not given a perfect blueprint from the start, they piece things together step-by-step in a broken and messy world.\nIn short, they design systems that run steadily, adapt quickly, and are affordable to maintain. They don’t chase technical perfection—they chase what works. That’s the beauty of system architecture.\nI only learned these things for an exam, but through that process, I rediscovered my passion for card optimization.\n3. The “Architecture Problems” of Card Enthusiasts Card optimization isn’t just “saving a little money.” And system architecture isn’t just “high-end tech design.” Despite different contexts, they both tackle the same core challenge:\nNavigating constraints, managing costs, and designing optimal structures in an uncertain world.\nCard enthusiasts don’t just apply for cards—they design capital flows.\nSystem architects don’t just code—they design control and data flows.\nCard people ask: how do I reduce fees, avoid risk flags, and ensure smooth transactions?\nArchitects ask: how do I reduce failures, scale up, and maintain stability?\nI originally studied architecture for the test, but looking back—it’s the same thinking I used when optimizing my card flows.\nCard World Architecture World Core Logic Fees Latency / Performance Cost Management Channel Limits API Call Restrictions Protocol Compatibility Card Regulations Module Specifications Compliance FX Disparities Cross-platform Overhead Environment Adaptation Card Diversity Tech Stack Diversity Module Integration Bank Risk Controls Security Strategies Risk Management Flow Paths Data Routing Architectural Routing Card optimization isn’t exploiting loopholes—it’s designing capital flow architectures.\nThey aren’t “doing things.” They’re building structures: not just finding the best cashback card, but designing a path that moves funds with minimal cost and maximum efficiency.\nThey don’t just ask “can it be done,” but “is it elegant.”\nCard optimization is solving a constrained shortest-path problem, just like service topology design is about optimizing module coupling under SLA limits.\nThe difference between them? Just different application domains.\n4. System Practice Through Personal Exploration Others chase cashback. I’m studying the ecosystem.\nEvery card enthusiast’s path is unique. We each deal with different banks, currencies, and lifestyles.\nThe fun doesn’t lie in copying others—but in finding your own optimal flow through trial and error, grounded in real context.\nI started off just trying to save a little on fees. But after digging through endless documentation, I realized: every bank had its own transfer policies, time windows, restrictions. Some offered free morning transfers, others were fast but limited to specific currencies. Some would randomly block transfers. It felt like a fog-of-war map—I had to explore, unlock nodes, and build routes.\nAfter countless small tests, I built a working, cost-effective flow tailored to myself. I avoided high-fee routes, optimized timing, and even exploited currency fluctuations for marginal gains.\nSome goals seemed impossible at first—like sending funds to countries with little infrastructure. But I eventually figured out how: crypto deposits, direct virtual currency payments, fiat-to-stablecoin automation, specialized remittance apps bypassing banks\u0026hellip; I made the impossible possible.\nThis transition—from “unreachable” to “path unlocked”—felt exactly like rebuilding a network architecture.\nI wasn’t just transferring money. I was redefining the structure of value transmission.\nSounds complex? It’s really just a classic systems design problem:\nHow do systems communicate and transfer data? How do we handle format (currency) conversions? Which nodes are reliable? Which paths are low-latency and low-failure? How do we move a “data packet” (money) through protocols (remittance channels) to the destination? Can it feel seamless from the user’s (my) perspective? That’s architecture: not feature-building, but designing a coherent, maintainable, scalable system.\nEach card is a node; each interface is a protocol. Every iteration? A tiny architectural optimization.\nIt’s route planning + interface negotiation + user experience. Sounds familiar, architect?\nCard enthusiasts aren’t just saving money. They’re reconstructing the world’s financial logic and taking control.\n5. Architectural Literacy Forged Through Card Craft Through every route choice, failed experiment, cost balancing act, and risk-management adjustment, card enthusiasts are honing a kind of architectural mindset. No servers, no code—but plenty of real-world structure tuning and efficiency refinement. That process? It\u0026rsquo;s hands-on system design.\nAll these behaviors, over time, naturally evolve into core architectural instincts:\nCapability Real-World Manifestation Architectural Principle Rule Familiarity Mastering bank limits and terms Documentation Literacy Integration Coordinating multi-card workflows System Integration Thinking Cost Awareness Minimizing transaction fees Performance/Cost Tradeoff Modeling Mapping optimal card flow paths Structural Modeling Risk Management Multi-account, failover logic High Availability Design Aesthetic Sense Making money “move elegantly” Engineering Beauty In many ways, card enthusiasts are simulating what it means to think like a systems architect—using the real world as their playground.\n6. My Reflection Fees are the enemy. Channels are sacred. Paths are art.\nI didn’t become a card enthusiast because I love swiping cards—I became one because through each experiment, I found beauty in structure. We may not write code or run servers, but every money transfer, every optimized flow—it’s all a personal exercise in system design.\nFrom prepping for the architecture certification to building my daily financial routes, I’ve come to realize:\nWhat I enjoy isn’t just getting things done—it’s making the path elegant.\nWhat others see as petty tricks, I see as system aesthetics.\nWhat others call loophole hunters, I call life architects.\nCardcraft isn’t just about saving money—it’s a real-world sandbox to train your sense of system design: visualizing problems, iterating solutions, aligning logic with beauty.\nIt’s not a waste of time. It’s a tactile, tangible, deeply personal “practice space” for designing real-world systems.\nIt’s not about saving money. It’s about skill-building.\nIt’s not about invention. It’s about choosing the right structure.\nWhether it’s designing systems or optimizing card flows, the point isn’t how much you saved or how many lines you wrote—it’s how much better you understand how the world works.\nAnd I? I’m the kind of person who stands in front of an ATM for 10 minutes—just to calculate the optimal fee path. Maybe I don’t have a server to deploy, but I’m still architecting.\nConclusion: Life Is the Ultimate Architecture Every time we swipe a card, transfer money, evaluate a route, or make a combination decision—we\u0026rsquo;re engaging in an invisible act of system design.\nArchitecture isn\u0026rsquo;t just about servers and APIs. Sometimes, it\u0026rsquo;s hidden between wallets, bank cards, and payment methods.\nAt the end of the card optimization path, perhaps what we find is not a loophole hunter—\n—but a life architect in disguise.\nAppendix: My Capital Flow in Code This code isn’t meant to be executable—it’s a model of how I think about my real-world money flows. It’s how I express everyday logistics through architectural language.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 // My cross-border capital flow (illustrative) func RouteCNYtoJPY(CNY float64) JPY float64 { HKD := BOCExchange(CNY, to=\u0026#34;HKD\u0026#34;) log.Printf(\u0026#34;Exchanged %.2f CNY to %.2f HKD\u0026#34;, CNY, HKD) Transfer(HKD, from=\u0026#34;BOC\u0026#34;, to=\u0026#34;BOCHK\u0026#34;, by=\u0026#34;pbservice\u0026#34;) log.Println(\u0026#34;Transferred via pbservice → BOCHK\u0026#34;) Transfer(HKD, from=\u0026#34;BOCHK\u0026#34;, to=\u0026#34;Wise\u0026#34;, by=\u0026#34;fpservice\u0026#34;) log.Println(\u0026#34;Transferred via fps → Wise\u0026#34;) JPY := WiseConvert(HKD, to=\u0026#34;JPY\u0026#34;) log.Printf(\u0026#34;Converted %.2f HKD to %.2f JPY via Wise\u0026#34;, HKD, JPY) Deposit(JPY, to=\u0026#34;Revolut\u0026#34;, with=\u0026#34;ApplePay\u0026#34;) return JPY } A code snippet built not for execution, but for expression—a symbolic blueprint connecting everyday money logic to architectural thinking.\nDisclaimer: This article is for entertainment and personal documentation purposes only.

I stopped in April 2025.\nMy last entry: ¥0\nThe Beginning: To Save Money and Gain Control It all started very simply — I wanted to control my spending and build better financial awareness. And in the beginning, it really worked. I successfully curbed some of my bad spending habits.\nThe Process: Stepping Into the World of Optimization and Card Collecting Gradually, in pursuit of “better” consumption, I started comparing everything, looking for the optimal choice. At first, it was just comparing product prices. Later, it expanded to payment methods, tools, and eventually to bank promotions and card applications.\nI applied for cards for discounts, then for convenience, and eventually just for collecting them. Step by step, I had fallen deep into the card-collecting world.\nWhat started as saving money, turned into convenience, and ended up becoming card collecting.\nThe Backfire: When Accounting Became a Burden And so, accounting itself slowly became a burden. More and more accounts, more and more complex scenarios — the time cost and mental cost of bookkeeping had long exceeded its actual benefits.\nThere were times I spent hours researching just to save a few bucks. At first, that felt fun. But after doing it over and over, finding the optimal solution no longer excited me — it just left me feeling empty.\nThe Change: From Seeking The Best to Seeking Comfort Maybe I’ve changed. My approach to consumption has changed too.\nFrom “maximize savings” to “close enough, as long as I’m comfortable.”\nI realized I had already broken through my original spending limits, yet I didn’t lose control. On the contrary, I came to understand more deeply: compared to saving money, my time and my happiness mattered more.\nThe Reflection: Why Am I Even Keeping Accounts? Because of bookkeeping, I started to:\nConstantly dig through records because I had too many accounts Create new accounts in the app frequently due to currency conversions Spend a long time hesitating over whether I should buy something Have my mood ruined during outings with friends over spending details That made me reflect — Why am I even doing this?\nIs it really worth it for the so-called “gains” from bookkeeping?\nThe Decision: Letting Go, Reset, Move On So I tried to let go, to not fuss over the details, and simply asked myself:\n“Am I happy?”\nAnd the result was — yes, I was really happy. And my spending wasn’t as high as I imagined either.\nPerhaps my habits had already trained me to naturally compare prices. Or maybe, emotional value is something that can never be measured by discounts.\nTherefore, I think it’s time to let go.\nAccounting has fulfilled its mission.\nIt’s no longer a tool, but a shackle.\nHabits are meant to improve life.\nIf they can no longer be sustained by passion, and instead get in the way of living, then it’s time to learn to say goodbye.\nThe Ending: Thank You, and Keep Living Giving up a habit I’ve maintained for two years is indeed a little bittersweet.\nBut maybe this is also a part of life. Nothing stays with us forever, but as long as the time spent together was beautiful, that’s enough.\nPerhaps I’ve lost a symbolic tool that made me feel like “I’m good at saving money.”\nBut more than that, I hope my future self won’t rely on numbers and records for a sense of security, but instead, live with true ease and freedom.\nFrom being in control, to flowing into the unknown.\nI hope I can adapt soon.\nAnd I hope I can spend the saved time on things that are more meaningful and more joyful.\nThe Last Entry, ¥0 Leaving a short note here.\nThank you to myself for two years of dedicated tracking.\nFrom now on, I hope to spend the saved time on things that are more meaningful and joyful.\nAnd just like that, I archived this experience.\nRecording ends, but life is only just beginning.\n","date":"2025-04-14T16:23:48+09:00","permalink":"https://blog.yexca.net/en/archives/244/","title":"From Saving Money, To Living Life, To Saying Goodbye"},{"content":" This article was partially machine translated\nIntroduction Is there a a way to study language listening without feeling like you\u0026rsquo;re studying, sometimes you can listen to repeatedly and try shadowing?
