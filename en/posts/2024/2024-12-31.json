After campus restrictions were lifted later on, I explored the surrounding areas a bit. Took the Soft Exam (software qualification) and JLPT, bought a Google Pixel 6, and got hooked on collecting credit cards."

Started the year interning in Shenzhen—checked out the new Costco there, saw the ocean for the first time, met so many awesome people, explored Huaqiangbei, and visited Hong Kong and Macau (plus my first boat ride!). My mindset really shifted too; after graduating and moving home, my attitude toward others changed, and I started connecting more with my family. We went to Xuzhou together. I also started cooking, DIY-ing stuff, and got my driver's license. After all that, I went to Japan—my first time flying, first time wearing anime gear in public, and my first time attending Comiket (C105)!"
